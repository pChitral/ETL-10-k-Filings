1053507,AMT,AMERICAN TOWER CORP /MA/,2003,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the heading “Critical Accounting Policies” on page 40. During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, we acquired various communications sites, service businesses and satellite and fiber network access related businesses for aggregate purchase prices of approximately $55.7 million, $827.2 million, and $1.8 billion, respectively. Our results of operations only reflect the acquired towers and businesses in the periods following their respective dates of acquisition. As such, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 are not comparable to the year ended December 31, 2001, and the results for the year ended December 31, 2001 are not comparable to the year ended December 31, 2000. Our continuing operations are reported in two segments, rental and management and network development services. Management focuses on segment profit (loss) as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments. We define segment operating profit (loss) as segment revenues less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization, corporate general and administrative expense, restructuring expense, development expense and impairments and net loss on sale of long-lived assets. Segment profit (loss) for the rental and management segment also includes interest income, TV Azteca, net (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements). In December 2002, we committed to a plan to dispose of Verestar (which previously comprised our entire satellite and fiber network access services segment) by sale within the next twelve months. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we also committed to a plan to sell Flash Technologies (previously included in our network development services segment) and two office buildings (previously included in our rental and management segment). In July 2002, we consummated the sale of MTS Components (previously included in our network development services segment). In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the consolidated statements of operations for periods reported in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” have been adjusted to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations. 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 As of December 31, 2002, we owned or operated approximately 14,600 communications sites, as compared to approximately 14,500 communications sites as of December 31, 2001. The acquisitions and construction completed throughout 2001 and, to a lesser extent, 2002, have significantly affected operations for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001.

The increase resulted from an increase in rental and management revenues of $113.6 million, offset by a decrease in network development services revenue of $110.3 million. 24 Table of Contents Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $548.9 million, an increase of $113.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase resulted primarily from leasing activity on towers acquired and constructed subsequent to January 1, 2001 and, to a lesser extent, increased revenue on towers that existed as of January 1, 2001. The 4,270 towers that we have acquired and constructed since January 1, 2001 have significantly increased our revenues. The increased depth and strength of our national and international portfolio provided us with a much larger base of tower revenue for a full year in 2002 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. The remaining component of the increase is attributable to an increase in same tower revenue related to towers included in our portfolio as of January 1, 2001. This increase was driven by our ability to market and add additional tenants to those towers. We continue to believe that our leasing revenue, which drives our core business, is likely to grow more rapidly than revenue from our network development services segment due to our expected increase in utilization of existing tower capacity. In addition, we believe that the majority of our leasing activity will continue to come from broadband type customers. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $239.5 million, a decrease of $110.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The significant decline in revenues during 2002 resulted primarily from decreases in revenue related to construction management, installation, tower maintenance services and radio frequency engineering services, resulting from a corresponding decrease in the growth of the wireless telecommunications industry. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $894.7 million, a decrease of $89.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The principal component of the decrease was attributable to expense decreases in our network development services segment of $95.2 million. The remaining components of the decrease were attributable to decreases in depreciation and amortization of $29.1 million, as well as decreases in corporate general and administrative expense of $2.1 million and development expense of $2.0 million. These decreases were offset by increases in expenses within our rental and management segment of $16.7 million, coupled with increases in impairments and net loss on sale of long-lived assets of $16.5 million and restructuring expense of $5.4 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $228.5 million, an increase of $16.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The majority of the increase resulted from incremental operating expenses incurred in 2002 for the more than 3,700 towers that were acquired or constructed during 2001 (due to a full year of inclusion in our results of operations in 2002). The balance of the increase reflects operating expenses incurred in 2002 for the more than 570 towers acquired/constructed in 2002. These increases were partially offset by cost reduction efforts in administrative and operational functions. Rental and management segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $334.3 million, an increase of $96.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase resulted primarily from incremental revenues and operating profit from both newly acquired and constructed towers and existing towers. Network Development Services Expense/Segment Profit Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $217.7 million, a decrease of $95.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The majority of the decrease was due to an overall decline in demand for the services performed by this segment, as discussed above, coupled with decreases in overhead and related infrastructure costs. 25 Table of Contents Network development services segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $21.8 million, a decrease of $15.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease resulted primarily from a decline in revenue, as discussed above, partially offset by a reduction in personnel, overhead and infrastructure costs as a result of restructuring initiatives that were implemented in 2002 and 2001. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $316.9 million, a decrease of $29.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease reflects the adoption of SFAS No. 142, which reduced amortization expense by approximately $70.0 million. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense related to the acquisition/construction of approximately $236.9 million of property and equipment in 2002 and a full year of depreciation on the $1.4 billion of property and equipment acquired in 2001. Corporate General and Administrative Expense Corporate general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $24.3 million, a decrease of $2.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The majority of the decrease is a result of cost reduction efforts in adminstrative and information technology functions related to our restructuring initiatives. Restructuring Expense In November 2001, we announced a restructuring of our organization to include a reduction in the scope of our tower development and acquisition activities and the centralization of certain operational and administrative functions. As a result of this continuing initiative, during the year ended December 31, 2002, we incurred employee separation costs associated with the termination of approximately 460 employees (primarily development and administrative), as well as costs associated with the termination of lease obligations and other incremental facility closing costs aggregating $10.6 million, an increase of $5.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. As of December 31, 2002, we have completed our restructuring initiatives to consolidate operations and do not expect future charges associated with this restructuring. Development Expense Development expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $5.9 million, a decrease of $2.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. This decrease resulted primarily from reduced expenses related to tower site data gathering and acquisition costs as a result of our curtailed acquisition and development related activities. Impairments and Net Loss on Sale of Long-Lived Assets Impairments and net loss on sale of long-lived assets for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $90.7 million, an increase of $16.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in impairment charges and net loss on sale of assets of approximately $35.1 million related to the write-down and sale of certain non-core towers, partially offset by a decrease in impairment charges of approximately $22.4 million related to the write-off of construction-in progress costs associated with sites that we no longer plan to build. 26 Table of Contents Interest Income Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $3.5 million, a decrease of $25.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in interest earned on invested cash primarily attributable to a decrease in cash on hand during 2002, coupled with lower interest rates. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $255.6 million, a decrease of $12.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The majority of the decrease, $26.6 million, resulted primarily from a reduction in the interest rates under our credit facilities. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $7.6 million related to a full year of interest incurred on our senior notes (issued in January 2001) and a reduction in capitalized interest of $9.5 million as a result of our reduced capital expenditures in 2002. Loss on Investments and Other Expense Loss on investments and other expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $25.6 million, a decrease of $13.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease resulted primarily from decreased impairment and equity losses on our cost and equity investments offset by increased losses on foreign currency exchange related to our Mexican subsidiary. Loss on Term Loan Cancellation In January 2002, we terminated the $250.0 million multi-draw term loan C component of our credit facilities and recorded a non-cash charge of approximately $7.2 million related to the write-off of certain deferred financing fees associated with that component. No similar charge was incurred for the year ended December 31, 2001. Note Conversion Expense During the year ended December 31, 2001, we acquired a portion of our 2.25% convertible notes in exchange for shares of our Class A common stock. As a consequence of those negotiated exchanges with certain of our noteholders, we recorded a non-cash charge of $26.3 million. These charges represent the fair value of incremental stock issued to noteholders to induce them to convert their holdings prior to the first scheduled redemption date. No similar charge was incurred for the year ended December 31, 2002. Income Tax Benefit The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $64.6 million, a decrease of $35.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The effective tax rate was 17.0% for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to 20.4% for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a valuation allowance of $27.5 million recorded in 2002 in connection with our plan to implement a tax planning strategy to accelerate the utilization of certain federal net operating losses (the valuation allowance represents the estimated lost tax benefit and costs associated with implementing this strategy). This decrease is offset by the impact of our ceasing to amortize goodwill (the majority of which is non-deductible for tax purposes) in 2002 in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations in 2002 differs from the statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to our state net operating losses, capital losses, tax planning strategy and foreign items. The effective tax rate in 2001 differs from the statutory rate due to valuation allowances related to state net operating losses and capital losses and other non-deductible items consisting principally of goodwill amortization, and to a lesser extent, note conversion expense. 27 Table of Contents SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” requires that we record a valuation allowance when it is “more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.” At December 31, 2002, we have provided a valuation allowance primarily related to state net operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards and the lost tax benefit and costs associated with implementing our tax planning strategy. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily federal net operating loss carryforwards, as management believes that we will have sufficient time to realize these assets during the carryforward period. We intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset from our tax planning strategy to accelerate the utilization of certain federal net operating losses. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state (no growth) projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments reducing interest expense. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2002 will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $800.0 million in taxable income from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2022. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future, or accelerate the utilization of losses as contemplated in our tax planning strategy, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense, which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders’ equity. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net In December 2002, we committed to a plan to dispose of our wholly owned subsidiary Verestar by sale within the next twelve months. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we also committed to a plan to sell Flash Technologies and two office buildings held primarily as rental property. In July 2002, we consummated the sale of our MTS Components operations. Accordingly, we presented the results of these operations, $(249.9) million and $(60.2) million, net of tax, as loss from discontinued operations, net, in the accompanying statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The net loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 also includes a net loss on disposal from the sale of MTS Components and the two office buildings of approximately $13.5 million, net of a tax benefit. All of these businesses held for sale as of December 31, 2002 and a subsidiary of Verestar were sold in the first quarter of 2003. We expect to sell the remaining portion of Verestar by December 31, 2003. Extraordinary Loss on Extinguishment of Debt, Net In February 2002, we repaid the $95.0 million outstanding under our Mexican Credit Facility with borrowings under our credit facilities. As a result of such repayment, we recognized an extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $1.1 million, net of an income tax benefit of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. No similar losses were recorded in 2001. Cumulative Effective of Change in Accounting Principle, Net As of January 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” As a result, we recognized a $562.6 million non-cash charge (net of a tax benefit of $14.4 million) as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the write-down of goodwill to its fair value. The non-cash charge was comprised of goodwill within our satellite and fiber network access services segment ($189.3 million) and network development services segment ($387.8 million). In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, the charge is reflected as of January 1, 2002 and included in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. 28 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 As of December 31, 2001, we owned or operated approximately 14,500 communications sites, as compared to approximately 11,000 communications sites as of December 31, 2000. The acquisitions and construction completed in 2001 and 2000 have significantly affected operations for the year ended December 31, 2001, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. Year Ended December 31, Amount of Increase (Decrease) Percent Increase (Decrease) 2001 2000 (In thousands) REVENUES: Rental and management $ 435,302 $ 270,298 $ 165,004 61 % Network development services 349,848 239,616 110,232 46 Total operating revenues 785,150 509,914 275,236 54 OPERATING EXPENSES: Rental and management 211,811 136,300 75,511 55 Network development services 312,926 210,313 102,613 49 Depreciation and amortization 346,020 241,211 104,809 43 Corporate general and administrative expense 26,478 14,958 11,520 77 Restructuring expense 5,236 5,236 N/A Development expense 7,895 14,433 (6,538 ) (45 ) Impairments and net loss on sale of long-lived assets 74,260 74,260 N/A Total operating expenses 984,626 617,215 367,411 60 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest income, TV Azteca, net of interest expense of $1,160 and $1,047, respectively 14,377 12,679 1,698 13 Interest income 28,622 15,954 12,668 79 Interest expense (267,825 ) (151,702 ) (116,123 ) 77 Loss on investments and other expense (38,797 ) (2,434 ) (36,363 ) 1,494 Note conversion expense (26,336 ) (16,968 ) (9,368 ) 55 Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries (318 ) (202 ) (116 ) 57 Income tax benefit 99,875 65,897 33,978 52 Loss from discontinued operations, net (60,216 ) (6,213 ) (54,003 ) 869 Extraordinary losses on extinguishment of debt, net (4,338 ) 4,338 N/A Net loss $ (450,094 ) $ (194,628 ) $ (255,466 ) 131 % Total Revenues Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $785.2 million, an increase of $275.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase resulted from increases in rental and management revenues of $165.0 million and increases in network development services revenue of $110.2 million. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $435.3 million, an increase of $165.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase resulted primarily from leasing activity on towers acquired and constructed subsequent to January 1, 2000 and, to a lesser extent, increased revenue on towers that existed as of January 1, 2000. The 9,900 towers that we have acquired and constructed since January 1, 2000 have significantly increased our revenues. The increased depth and strength of our national and 29 Table of Contents international portfolio provided us with a much larger base of tower revenue for a full year in 2001 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2000. The remaining component of the increase is attributable to an increase in same tower revenue related to towers included in our portfolio as of January 1, 2000. This increase was driven by our ability to market and add additional tenants to those towers. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $349.8 million, an increase of $110.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The significant growth in revenues during 2001 resulted primarily from increased volume related to construction management, antennae and line installation and related collocation services, and tower site maintenance. The increase was also driven by a full year of revenue in 2001 related to acquisitions consummated in 2000, primarily a steel fabrication business. These increases were partially offset by decreases in revenue related to radio frequency engineering services. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $984.6 million, an increase of $367.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase was attributable to depreciation and amortization of $104.8 million, increases in expenses within rental and management of $75.5 million, network development services of $102.6 million, restructuring expense of $5.2 million, corporate general and administrative expense of $11.5 million and impairments and net loss on sale of long-lived assets of $74.3 million. These increases were offset by a decrease in development expense of $6.5 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $211.8 million, an increase of $75.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The majority of the increase resulted from incremental operating expenses incurred in 2001 for the more than 6,200 towers that were acquired or constructed during 2000 (due to a full year of inclusion in our results of operations in 2001). The balance of the increase reflects operating expenses incurred in 2001 for the more than 3,700 towers acquired/constructed in 2001. These increases were partially offset by cost reduction efforts in administrative and operational functions. Rental and management segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $237.9 million, an increase of $91.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase resulted primarily from incremental revenues and operating profit from both newly acquired and constructed towers and existing towers. Network Development Services Expense/Segment Profit Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $312.9 million, an increase of $102.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The majority of the increase resulted from overall increases in volume (as discussed above), incremental expenses related to the operations of acquisitions and increases in overhead costs necessary to support both internal construction and external sales. Network development services segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $36.9 million, an increase of $7.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in the volume of services, as discussed above. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $346.0 million, an increase of $104.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The principal component of the increase is an increase 30 Table of Contents in depreciation expense of $86.7 million. This is primarily a result of our purchase, construction and acquisition of approximately $1.4 billion of property and equipment during 2001 and a full year of depreciation on acquisitions and additions made in 2000. The other component of the increase is increased amortization of $31.1 million, resulting from our recording and amortizing approximately $184.1 million of goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions consummated during 2001, and a full year of amortization on goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions made in 2000. Corporate General and Administrative Expense Corporate general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $26.5 million, an increase of $11.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The majority of the increase is a result of increased personnel and information technology costs to support our overall growth, coupled with expenses incurred to implement a new company-wide Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. Restructuring Expense In November 2001, we announced a restructuring of our organization to include a reduction in the scope of our tower development and acquisition activities and the centralization of certain operating and administrative functions. As part of that initiative, we incurred employee separation costs relating to the termination of approximately 525 employees (primarily development and administrative), as well as costs associated with closing certain facilities, aggregating $5.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. No similar charges were incurred in 2000. Development Expense Development expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $7.9 million, a decrease of $6.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. This decrease resulted primarily from reduced expenses related to tower site, data gathering and acquisition integration in 2001. Impairments and Net Loss on Sale of Long-Lived Assets Impairments and net loss on sale of long-lived assets for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $74.3 million. The increase is attributed to non-cash impairment charges aggregating $11.7 million related to the write-down of certain non-core towers and a non-cash impairment charge of $62.6 related to the write-off of construction-in progress costs associated with sites that we no longer planned to build. No similar charges were incurred in 2000. Interest Income, TV Azteca, Net Interest income, TV Azteca, net for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $14.4 million, an increase of $1.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase resulted from interest earned on the entire principal amount of the note, $119.8 million, during 2001 as compared to 2000 when less than the entire principal amount of the note was outstanding for the year. Interest Income Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $28.6 million, an increase of $12.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in interest earned on invested cash on hand, resulting principally from the sale of our senior notes in January 2001. 31 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $267.8 million, an increase of $116.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The majority of the increase, $113.0 million, resulted primarily from increased borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities and the issue of $1.0 billion of senior notes in January 2001, offset by a decrease in interest rates under our credit facilities. The remaining component of the increase represented increases in interest on capital leases and other notes payable and incremental deferred financing amortization. Loss on Investments and Other Expense Loss on investments and other expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $38.8 million, an increase of $36.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase resulted primarily from the write off of our investment in US Wireless of $23.4 million, coupled with additional investment impairment losses of $4.3 million and increases in losses on equity investments of $6.6 million. Note Conversion Expense During the year ended December 31, 2001, we acquired a portion of our 2.25% convertible notes in exchange for shares of our Class A common stock. As a consequence of those negotiated exchanges with certain of our noteholders, we recorded a non-cash charge of $26.3 million. In similar transactions during the year ended December 31, 2000, we acquired a portion of our 6.25% and 2.25% convertible notes in exchange for shares of our Class A common stock. As a result, we recorded a non-cash charge of $17.0 million during that year. These charges represent the fair value of incremental stock issued to noteholders to induce them to convert their holdings prior to the first scheduled redemption date. Income Tax Benefit The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $99.9 million, an increase of $34.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2000. The primary reason for the increase is a result of the increase in our loss from continuing operations, partially offset by an increase in amortization of non-deductible intangible items. The effective tax rate on our loss from continuing operations was 20.4% for the year ended December 31, 2001, as compared to 26.4% for the year ended December 31, 2000. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations in 2001 differs from the statutory rate due to certain non-deductible amounts for tax purposes such as the valuation allowances related to state net operating losses, capital losses and the effects of other non-deductible items such as goodwill amortization and note conversion expense. The effective tax rate in 2000 differs from the statutory rate due to the recording of valuation allowances related to state net operating losses and other non-deductible items consisting principally of goodwill amortization, and to a lesser extent, note conversion expense. SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” requires that we record a valuation allowance when it is “more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.” At December 31, 2001, we have provided a valuation allowance primarily related to state net operating loss carryforwards and capital losses. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily federal net operating loss carryforwards, as management believes that we will have sufficient time to realize these assets during the carryforward period. As of December 31, 2001, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state (no growth) projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments 32 Table of Contents reducing interest expense. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that its net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2001 will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $740.0 million in taxable income from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2021. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense, which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders’ equity. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net In December 2002, we committed to a plan to dispose of our wholly owned subsidiary Verestar by sale within the next twelve months. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we also committed to a plan to sell Flash Technologies and two office buildings held primarily as rental property. In July 2002, we consummated the sale of MTS Components. Accordingly, we presented the results of these operations, $(60.2) million and $(6.2) million, net of tax, as loss from discontinued operations, net, in the accompanying statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Extraordinary Losses on Extinguishment of Debt, Net We incurred extraordinary losses on the extinguishment of debt, net in 2000 of $4.3 million. The losses were incurred as a result of an amendment and restatement of our primary credit facilities ($3.0 million, net of a tax benefit of $2.0 million) and our early retirement of debt ($1.3 million, net of a tax benefit of $0.9 million). No comparable losses were recorded in 2001. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Overview Our primary sources of liquidity have been internally generated funds from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from equity and debt offerings, proceeds from the sale of non-core assets and cash on hand. We have used those funds to meet our capital requirements, which consist primarily of operational needs, debt service and capital expenditures for tower construction and acquisitions. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and service our cash interest expense. We believe cash flow from operations in 2003 will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and cash interest payments for that year. In January 2003, we completed an offering (discount note offering) of approximately $420.0 million, consisting of 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes due 2008 (discount notes) of ATI and warrants to purchase 11.4 million shares of our Class A common stock. In connection with the financing, we obtained an amendment of our credit facilities (credit agreement amendment). Pursuant to the credit agreement amendment, we repaid $200.0 million of term loans outstanding under our credit facilities and reduced our revolving loan commitments by $225.0 million to $425.0 million. That amendment also gives us the right to use $217.0 million, which we have placed in escrow for that purpose, to purchase our 2.25% convertible notes on or prior to October 22, 2003, at which time the holders have the right to put those notes to us. We may elect to satisfy all or a portion of our obligations with respect to the 2.25% convertible notes through the issuance of shares of our Class A common stock (subject to certain restrictions) on October 22, 2003 pursuant to the put right or, prior to that time, pursuant to a limited number of privately negotiated transactions. We also may use any escrowed funds not used to purchase 2.25% convertible notes to purchase, prior to June 30, 2004, our other convertible notes and our senior notes. We are required to use any funds remaining in escrow on June 30, 2004 to reduce our term loans under the credit facilities. 33 Table of Contents We expect our 2003 capital needs to consist primarily of the following: debt service, including cash interest of approximately $215.0 million, repayment of approximately $54.4 million of term loans under our amended credit facilities and up to $217.0 million of 2.25% convertible notes (assuming all holders exercise their put rights); capital expenditures of between $50.0 and $75.0 million; and tower acquisitions of approximately $74.0 million. We expect to meet those needs through a combination of cash on hand of approximately $127.3 million at December 31, 2002, remaining net proceeds from the discount note offering of approximately $197.0 million (after the repayment of $200.0 million of term loans), cash generated by operations, proceeds from sales of non-core assets, and nominal, if any, borrowings under our credit facilities. Due to the risk factors outlined above, however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our capital needs without additional borrowings under our credit facilities. Uses of Liquidity Our principal uses of liquidity, in addition to funding operations, are debt service and capital expenditures for tower construction and acquisitions. Debt Service. As of December 31, 2002, we had outstanding debt of approximately $3.5 billion, consisting of the following: • credit facilities—$1.5 billion; • senior notes—$1.0 billion; • convertible notes, net of discount—$873.6 million; and • other—$81.0 million (primarily capital leases and notes payable). Our debt instruments require us to make current interest payments and significant principal payments at their respective maturities. In addition, in the case of our credit facilities, we must make scheduled amortization payments in increasing amounts designed to repay the loans at maturity. During 2003, we will be required to repay approximately $13.6 million of the amended term loans each quarter. Prior to maturity, there are no mandatory redemption provisions for cash in the senior notes, the convertible notes or the discount notes. The holders of the convertible notes, however, have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on specified dates prior to maturity, but we may at our election pay the repurchase price in cash or by issuing shares of our Class A common stock, subject to certain conditions in the applicable indenture. Our credit facilities restrict our ability to repurchase convertible notes for cash, except that we now have the right to use up to $217.0 million to prepay or repurchase the 2.25% convertible notes and, to the extent we do not and are not otherwise required to do so, to prepay or repurchase prior to June 30, 2004, any of our other convertible notes or our senior notes. Tower Construction and Acquisition Needs. We have significantly reduced our planned level of tower construction and acquisitions for 2003 from prior years. As a result, we anticipate that our liquidity needs for new tower development and acquisitions during 2003 will be significantly less than in previous periods. • Construction. In 2003, we expect to build between 100 and 150 towers (including broadcast towers) and expect total capital expenditures to be between $50.0 million and $75.0 million. • Acquisitions. As of December 31, 2002, we were committed to make expenditures of approximately $74.0 million for pending acquisitions, principally the NII Holdings transaction, of which approximately $24.0 million had been paid as of March 4, 2003. Sources of Liquidity We expect to meet our cash requirements for 2003 through a combination of cash on hand, net proceeds from the discount note offering, cash generated by operations, proceeds from sales of non-core assets, and nominal, if any, borrowings under our credit facilities. 34 Table of Contents Cash on Hand. As of December 31, 2002, we had approximately $127.3 million in cash on hand. As a result of the net proceeds from the discount note offering and the $200.0 million repayment of term loans under our credit facilities described above, we had approximately $324.3 million of cash on hand, including $217.0 million in escrow. As explained above, while we have the right to use up to $217.0 million of the escrowed funds to purchase the 2.25% convertible notes, we may elect to satisfy all or a portion of our obligations with respect to those notes through the issuance of shares of our Class A common stock. Cash Generated by Operations. We expect our cash flow needs by segment for 2003 to be as follows (excluding cash requirements to fund debt service, as interest expense is not allocated to our segments). Our rental and management and network development services segments are expected to generate cash flows from operations during 2003 in excess of their cash needs for operations and capital expenditures. We expect to use the excess cash generated from these segments principally to service our debt. Effective December 31, 2002, we committed to a plan to dispose of our satellite and fiber network access services segment. Accordingly, these operations are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements. The businesses in our former satellite and fiber network access services segment are expected to be near cash flow break-even from operations, but may require additional sources of liquidity to fund minimal capital expenditures until final disposition. In addition, we currently provide financial guarantees of up to $12.0 million for certain Verestar contractual obligations. Depending on the terms of any disposition, we may continue to be obligated with respect to those guarantees. Divestiture Proceeds. We are continuing to pursue strategic divestitures of non-core assets in an effort to enhance efficiency and increase our focus on our core tower operations. Through March 4, 2003, we completed approximately $203.5 million in non-core asset sales (including approximately $78.5 million subsequent to December 31, 2002) related to (a) our two components businesses, (b) a Verestar subsidiary, (c) our corporate office building and other real estate assets, and (d) non-core towers. Proceeds from those and any future transactions have and will be used, to the extent permitted under our credit facilities and mortgages, to fund capital expenditures for tower construction and acquisitions. We anticipate approximately $50.0 million of proceeds from additional sales of non-core assets during the remainder of 2003. Credit Facilities. As of December 31, 2002, we had drawn $160.0 million of the $650.0 million revolving line of credit under our credit facilities (the only component of our credit facilities which is not fully drawn). We also had outstanding letters of credit of $19.2 million as of December 31, 2002. Availability under our revolving line of credit as of December 31, 2002, was $470.8 million, net of $19.2 million of outstanding letters of credit. The credit agreement amendment decreased the revolving loan commitment to $425.0 million, thereby reducing availability to $245.8 million. Cash Flows Summary For the year ended December 31, 2002, cash flows provided by operating activities were $105.1 million, as compared to $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase is primarily due to an increase in cash flow generated from our rental and management segment, coupled with a decrease in our overall investment in working capital. For the year ended December 31, 2002, cash flows used for investing activities were $115.3 million, as compared to $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in cash expended for acquisitions, property and equipment and construction activities, coupled with an increase in proceeds received from the sale of non-core businesses and assets. For the year ended December 31, 2002, cash flows provided by financing activities were $101.4 million, as compared to $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease is primarily related to a reduction in proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities. 35 Table of Contents Certain Contractual Commitments Below is a summary of certain provisions of our credit facilities, discount notes, senior notes, convertible notes and certain other contractual obligations. It is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the actual agreements which have been filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For information about the restrictive covenants in our debt instruments, see “Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity.” For more information about our obligations, commitments and contingencies, see our consolidated financial statements herein and the accompanying notes thereto and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for principal payments and contractual maturity dates as of December 31, 2002. Credit Facilities. Our credit facilities (prior to the February 2003 credit agreement amendment), provided us with a borrowing capacity of up to $2.0 billion (after giving effect to the amendment — $1.575 billion). Our principal operating subsidiaries (other than Verestar) are the borrowers under our credit facilities. Borrowings under the credit facilities are subject to compliance with certain financial ratios as described below. Our credit facilities currently include: • a $650.0 million (as amended — $425.0 million) revolving credit facility, of which $160.0 million was drawn and against which $19.2 million of undrawn letters of credit were outstanding on December 31, 2002, maturing on June 30, 2007; • an $850.0 million (as amended — $725.0 million) multi-draw term loan A, which was fully drawn on December 31, 2002, maturing on June 30, 2007; and • a $500.0 million (as amended — $425.0 million) term loan B, which was fully drawn on December 31, 2002, maturing on December 31, 2007. We are required under our credit facilities to make scheduled amortization payments in increasing amounts designed to repay the loans at maturity. During 2003, we will be required to repay approximately $13.6 million of the amended term loans each quarter. We and our restricted subsidiaries, as well as Verestar and its subsidiaries, have guaranteed all of the loans under our credit facilities. We have secured the loans by liens on substantially all assets of the borrowers and the restricted subsidiaries, as well as Verestar and its subsidiaries, and substantially all outstanding capital stock and other debt and equity interests of all of our direct and indirect subsidiaries. The amended credit facilities permit us to use up to $217.0 million to repurchase the 2.25% convertible notes. We may use any escrowed funds not used to purchase 2.25% convertible notes to purchase, prior to June 30, 2004, our other convertible notes and our senior notes. We are required to use any escrowed funds remaining at June 30, 2004 to reduce our term loans under the credit facilities. Discount Notes and Warrants. In January 2003, American Towers, Inc. (ATI), our principal operating subsidiary, issued 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes due 2008 with a principal amount at maturity of $808.0 million. The discount notes will mature on August 1, 2008. No cash interest is payable on the discount notes. Instead, the accreted value of each discount note increases between the date of original issuance and the maturity date at a rate of 12.25% per annum. The discount notes rank junior in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness of ATI, the sister guarantors and their domestic subsidiaries and structurally senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future indebtedness. The discount notes are jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by us and all of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, other than Verestar and its subsidiaries. As part of the discount notes offering, we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 11.4 million shares of our Class A common stock at a price of $0.01 per share. The warrants and the discount notes were originally issued together as 808,000 units, each unit consisting of (1) one discount note having a principal value of $1,000 36 Table of Contents at maturity, and (2) one warrant to purchase 14.0953 shares of our Class A common stock at $0.01 per share. The warrants are exercisable at any time on or after January 29, 2006 and will expire on August 1, 2008. At the time of issuance, the warrants represented approximately 5.5% of our outstanding common stock (assuming exercise of all warrants). The holders of the discount notes and the warrants have registration rights requiring us to file registration statements with respect to the discount notes and warrants and subjecting us to penalties if such registration statements are not timely filed and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 9 3/8% Senior Notes. As of December 31, 2002, we had outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion of 9 3/8% senior notes. The senior notes mature on February 1, 2009. Interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1. The senior note indenture does not contain any sinking fund or mandatory redemption requirement for the senior notes prior to maturity. October 1999 Convertible Notes. In October 1999, we issued 6.25% convertible notes due 2009 in an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million and 2.25% convertible notes due 2009 at an issue price of $300.1 million, representing 70.52% of their principal amount at maturity of $425.5 million. The difference between the issue price and the principal amount at maturity of the 2.25% convertible notes will be accreted each year at the rate of 6.25% per annum as interest expense in our consolidated financial statements. The 6.25% convertible notes are convertible into shares of our Class A common stock at a conversion price of $24.40 per share. The 2.25% convertible notes are convertible into shares of Class A common stock at a conversion price of $24.00 per share. The indentures under which the convertible notes were issued do not contain any sinking fund or mandatory redemption requirement for the convertible notes prior to maturity. However, holders may require us to repurchase all or any of their 6.25% convertible notes on October 22, 2006 at their principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest. Holders may require us to repurchase all or any of their 2.25% convertible notes on October 22, 2003 at $802.93, which is its issue price plus accreted original issue discount, together with accrued and unpaid interest. Based on the principal amount of the 2.25% notes outstanding as of December 31, 2002, we may be required to repurchase up to $216.7 million (accreted through October 22, 2003) principal amount of our 2.25% convertible notes on October 22, 2003, if all the holders exercise this put right. We may, subject to certain conditions in the applicable indenture, elect to pay the repurchase price of each series of convertible notes in cash or shares of our Class A common stock, or any combination thereof. The amended credit facilities permit us to use up to $217.0 million of escrowed cash to purchase the 2.25% convertible notes, whether pursuant to the holders’ put rights on October 22, 2003, in privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Notwithstanding this right, we will continue to evaluate financing opportunities with respect to our convertible notes generally and, in particular, with respect to the put right of the 2.25% convertible notes. Since we issued the convertible notes, we have successfully reduced the principal amount outstanding of these convertible notes by entering into, from time to time, a limited number of privately negotiated agreements with noteholders to induce them to convert their convertible notes into shares of our Class A common stock. As a result of such conversions, we acquired $155.6 million principal amount (face) of the 2.25% convertible notes and $87.3 million of the 6.25% convertible notes during 2000 and 2001. We may seek, from time to time, to reduce further our indebtedness through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such purchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. If the put option of the holders of the 2.25% convertible notes is satisfied by other means or if it is not exercised in full by the holders, we may use any remaining escrowed funds to pay, prior to June 30, 2004, any of our other convertible notes or our senior notes. As of December 31, 2002, the total amounts outstanding under the 2.25% and 6.25% convertible notes were $210.9 million and $212.7 million, respectively. 37 Table of Contents February 2000 Convertible Notes. In February 2000, we issued 5.0% convertible notes due 2010 in an aggregate principal amount of $450.0 million. The 5.0% convertible notes are convertible into shares of our Class A common stock at a conversion price of $51.50 per share. The indenture under which the 5.0% convertible notes are outstanding does not contain any sinking fund or mandatory redemption requirement for the convertible notes prior to maturity. However, holders may require us to repurchase all or any of the 5.0% convertible notes on February 20, 2007 at their principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest. We may, subject to certain conditions in the indenture, elect to pay the repurchase price in cash or shares of Class A common stock or any combination thereof. The total amount outstanding under the 5.0% convertible notes as of December 31, 2002 was $450.0 million. Other Long-Term Debt. As of December 31, 2002, we had approximately $81.0 million of other long-term debt, including $47.2 million of capital lease obligations and $33.8 million of mortgage indebtedness and other notes payable. Tower Construction and Acquisition. As of December 31, 2002, we were party to various arrangements relating to the construction of tower sites under existing build-to-suit agreements. In addition, as of December 31, 2002, we were committed to acquire approximately 400 communication sites for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $74.0 million, of which $24.0 million had been funded as of March 4, 2003. ATC Separation. In connection with the ATC Separation, we agreed to reimburse CBS for any tax liabilities incurred by American Radio as a result of the transaction. Upon completion of the final American Radio tax returns, the amount of these tax liabilities was determined and paid by us. We continue to be obligated under a tax indemnification agreement with CBS, however, until June 30, 2003, subject to the extension of federal and applicable state statutes of limitations. We are currently aware that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is in the process of auditing certain tax returns filed by CBS and its predecessors, including those that relate to American Radio and the ATC Separation transaction. In the event that the IRS imposes additional tax liabilities on American Radio relating to the ATC Separation, we would be obligated to reimburse CBS for such liabilities. We cannot currently anticipate or estimate the potential additional tax liabilities, if any, that may be imposed by the IRS, however, such amounts could be material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We are not aware of any material obligations relating to this tax indemnity as of December 31, 2002. Accordingly, no amounts have been provided for in the consolidated financial statements relating to this indemnification. Liquidity Table For Contractual Obligations. The following table sets forth information with respect to our long-term obligations payable in cash (related to continuing operations) as of December 31, 2002 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 years Long-term debt obligations * $ 3,417,459 $ 267,636 $ 436,700 $ 1,713,123 $ 1,000,000 Capital lease obligations 47,220 2,506 3,108 183 41,423 Operating lease obligations 759,802 81,487 133,966 98,373 445,976 Purchase obligations for acquisitions 73,851 73,851 Total $ 4,928,332 $ 425,480 $ 573.774 $ 1,811,679 $ 1,487,399 * The holders of our convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on specified dates prior to their maturity dates in 2009 and 2010, but we may pay the purchase price by issuing shares of our Class A common stock, subject to certain conditions discussed elsewhere in this annual report. The obligation with respect to the right of the holders to put the 2.25% convertible notes on October 22, 2003 of approximately $210.9 million as of December 31, 2002 has been classified as an obligation due in “Less than 1 year”. The obligations with respect to the right of the holders to put the 6.25% convertible notes ($212.7 million) and 5% notes ($450.0 million) on October 22, 2006 and February 20, 2007, respectively, have been classified as an obligation due in “3-5 years” as of December 31, 2002. 38 Table of Contents The above table does not include approximately $116.9 million of aggregate principal payments for Verestar capital leases that are included in liabilities held for sale as of December 31, 2002 and financial guarantees of up to $12.0 million that we may be obligated to pay in connection with certain Verestar contractual obligations. Such amounts have been excluded from the table as we expect to sell the remaining portion of Verestar by December 31, 2003. The above table also excludes certain commitments relating to the construction of tower sites under existing build to suit agreements as of December 31, 2002, as we cannot currently estimate the timing and amounts of such payments. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Internally Generated Funds. The key factors affecting our internally generated funds are the demand for antennae space on wireless communications towers and for related services, our ability to maximize the utilization of our existing towers and our ability to minimize costs and fully achieve our operating efficiencies. Credit Facilities. Our credit facilities, as amended in February 2003, contain certain financial ratios and operational covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guarantees, dividends and other distributions, investments and liens) with which our borrower subsidiaries and restricted subsidiaries must comply. Any failure to comply with these covenants would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under our revolving line of credit, but would also constitute a default. These covenants also restrict our ability, as the parent, to incur any debt other than that presently outstanding and refinancings of that debt. Our credit facilities, as amended, contain five financial tests: • a leverage ratio (Total Debt to Annualized Operating Cash Flow). As of December 31, 2002, we were required to maintain a ratio of not greater than 6.00 to 1.00, increasing to 6.25 to 1.00 at January 1, 2003, decreasing to 6.00 to 1.00 at July 1, 2003, to 5.75 to 1.00 at October 1, 2003, to 5.50 to 1.00 at January 1, 2004, to 5.25 to 1.00 at April 1, 2004, to 5.00 to 1.00 at July 1, 2004, to 4.75 to 1.00 at October 1, 2004, to 4.50 to 1.00 at January 1, 2005, to 4.25 to 1.00 at April 1, 2005 and to 4.00 to 1.00 at July 1, 2005 and thereafter; • a senior leverage ratio (Senior Debt to Annualized Operating Cash Flow). As of January 1, 2003, we were required to maintain a ratio of not greater than 4.90 to 1.00, decreasing to 4.75 to 1.00 at April 1, 2003, to 4.50 to 1.00 at July 1, 2003, to 4.25 to 1.00 at October 1, 2003, to 4.00 to 1.00 at January 1, 2004, to 3.75 to 1.00 at April 1, 2004, to 3.50 to 1.00 at July 1, 2004, to 3.25 to 1.00 at October 1, 2004 and to 3.00 to 1.00 at January 1, 2005 and thereafter; • a pro forma debt service test (Annualized Operating Cash Flow to Pro Forma Debt Service). As of December 31, 2002, we were required to maintain a ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1.00; • an interest coverage test (Annualized Operating Cash Flow to Interest Expense). As of December 31, 2002, we were required to maintain a ratio of not less than 2.00 to 1.00, increasing by 0.50 on each of January 1, 2003 and January 1, 2004; and • a fixed charge coverage test (Annualized Operating Cash Flow to Fixed Charges). As of December 31, 2003, we will be required to maintain a ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0. The amended credit facilities also limit our revolving loan drawdowns based on our cash on hand. Because the credit facilities are with certain of our subsidiaries, including ATI, our senior notes and convertible notes are not included in the computations of any of the tests, except in the case of the pro forma debt service and fixed charge coverage tests in which case interest includes the amount of funds that we need our subsidiaries to distribute to us so we can pay interest on our senior notes and our convertible notes. Annualized Operating Cash Flow is based, among other things, on four times the Operating Cash Flow for the most recent quarter of our tower rental and management business and trailing 12 months for our other businesses and for corporate general and administrative expenses. In the case of the leverage ratio, we may include the Operating Cash Flow from Brazil and Mexico only to the extent of 10% of Annualized Operating Cash Flow and we receive credit for only 75% of Annualized Operating Cash Flow from our services businesses. 39 Table of Contents We were in compliance with the borrowing ratio covenants in effect as of December 31, 2002, and as amended by the February 2003 amendment. 9 3/8% Senior Note Indenture. The senior note indenture contains certain restrictive covenants with which we and our restricted subsidiaries (which includes all of our subsidiaries other than Verestar and its subsidiaries) must comply. These include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions, make certain investments and, as in the credit facilities, use the proceeds from asset sales. Any failure to comply with these covenants would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds, but would also constitute a default. Specifically, the senior note indenture restricts us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock unless our consolidated debt (which excludes debt of Verestar and its subsidiaries but includes the liquidation value of certain preferred stock) is not greater than 7.5 times our Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow. However, we are permitted, even if we are not in compliance with the ratio, to incur debt under our credit facilities, or renewals, refundings, replacements or refinancings of them, up to $2.65 billion. Even if not in compliance with the ratio, we are also permitted to, among other things, have certain types of capital leases and to refund or refinance our convertible notes, subject to certain requirements. Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow is substantially similar to the definition of Annualized Operating Cash Flow, as defined in the credit facilities, except it applies to us and our subsidiaries (other than Verestar and its subsidiaries). 12.25% Discount Notes. The discount note indenture contains certain restrictive covenants with which ATI, the sister guarantors and its and their subsidiaries must comply. These include restrictions on the ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions, make certain investments and, as in the credit facilities, use the proceeds from asset sales. Any failure to comply with these covenants would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds, but would also constitute a default. Specifically, the discount note indenture restricts ATI, each of the sister guarantors and its and their restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock. However, ATI, the sister guarantors and its and their subsidiaries are permitted to incur debt under our credit facilities, or renewals, refundings, replacements or refinancings of them, up to $1.6 billion. They are also permitted, among other things, to have certain types of capital leases and to refund or refinance existing indebtedness, subject to certain requirements. Convertible Notes. The indentures under which our convertible notes are outstanding do not contain any restrictions on, among other things, the payment of dividends or the making of other distributions, the incurrence of debt, or liens or the repurchase of our equity securities, or any financial covenants. Capital Markets. Our ability to raise additional funds in the capital markets depends on, among other things, general economic conditions, the condition of the wireless industry, our financial performance and the state of the capital markets. Critical Accounting Policies In December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants disclose their most “critical accounting policies” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The SEC indicated that a “critical accounting policy” is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results and requires management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Further, “critical accounting policies” are those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting policies described below fit the definition of “critical accounting policies.” We reviewed our policies for the year ended December 31, 2002 and determined that they remain our most critical accounting policies. With the exception of the asset impairment charges and the adoption of SFAS No. 142, we did not make any changes to those policies during the year ended December 31, 2002. 40 Table of Contents • Income Taxes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. At December 31, 2002, we provided a valuation allowance of approximately $118.6 million primarily related to our state operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards. In addition, we also recorded a valuation allowance in 2002 related to implementing a tax planning strategy to accelerate the utilization of certain federal net operating losses (the valuation allowance represents the estimated lost tax benefit and costs associated with implementing this strategy). We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards as management believes that we will have sufficient time to realize these assets during the carryforward period. We intend to recover a portion of our net deferred tax asset from our tax planning strategy to accelerate the utilization of certain federal net operating losses. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state (no growth) projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments reducing interest expense. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $800.0 million in taxable income from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2022. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future, or accelerate the utilization of our losses as contemplated in our tax planning strategy, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense, which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity. • Impairment of Assets. Assets subject to amortization and non-core assets held for sale: We review long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows. If we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset’s fair market value as compared to its carrying value. We record any related impairment losses in the period in which we identify such impairment. We also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based management’s best estimate of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition. We record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss. Goodwill—Assets not subject to amortization: As of January 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized, but reviewed for impairment at least annually. SFAS No. 142 also requires that we assess whether goodwill is impaired by performing a transitional impairment test. The impairment test is comprised of two steps. The initial step is designed to identify potential goodwill impairment by comparing an estimate of fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, a second step is performed, which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. Fair value estimates were determined based on independent third party appraisals for the rental and management segment and former SFNA segment and future discounted cash flows and market information in the services segment. 41 Table of Contents We completed our transitional impairment testing in the second quarter of 2002 and concluded that all of the goodwill related to our former SFNA segment was impaired and that the majority of the goodwill in the services segment was impaired. As a result, we recognized a $562.6 million non-cash charge (net of a tax benefit of $14.4 million) related to the write-down of goodwill to its fair value. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, the charge is reflected as of January 1, 2002 and included in the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. We also completed our annual impairment testing in December 2002 related to the goodwill of the tower rental and management reporting unit that contains goodwill and Kline (the only services business with remaining goodwill) and determined that goodwill was not impaired. We obtained an independent third party appraisal of the tower and rental management reporting unit that contains goodwill and utilized market information to value Kline. We will perform our annual goodwill impairment test in December of each year and when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. • Investment Impairment Charges. Investments in those entities where we own less than twenty percent of the voting stock of the individual entity and do not exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the entity are accounted for using the cost method. Investments in entities where we own less than twenty percent but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the entity or where we own more than twenty percent of the voting stock of the individual entity, but not in excess of fifty percent, are accounted for using the equity method. Our investments are in companies that are not publicly traded, and, therefore, no established market for these securities exists. We have a policy in place to review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the investments in these companies. If we believe that the carrying value of an investment is carried at an amount in excess of fair value, it is our policy to record an impairment charge to adjust the carrying value to the market value. • Revenue Recognition. A portion of our network development services revenue is derived under contracts or arrangements with customers that provide for billings on a fixed price basis. Revenues under these contracts are recognized using the percentage-of-completion methodology. Under the percentage-of-completion methodology, revenues are recognized in accordance with the percentage of contract costs incurred to date compared to the estimated total contract costs. Due to uncertainties and estimates inherent within percentage-of-completion accounting it is possible that estimates will be revised as project work progresses. Changes to total estimated contract costs or losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined. The above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. See our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page F-1 of this annual report where our significant accounting policies are discussed. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.” This statement establishes accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the related asset retirement costs. The requirements of SFAS No. 143 are effective for us as of January 1, 2003. We will adopt this statement in the first quarter of 2003 and do not expect the impact of adopting this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 42 Table of Contents In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145 “Rescission of FASB Statement Nos. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections.” Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 145, gains and losses from extinguishment of debt will no longer be classified as an extraordinary item, but rather will generally be classified as part of other income (expense) on our consolidated statement of operations. Any such gains or losses classified as extraordinary items in prior periods will be reclassified in future financial statement presentations upon the adoption of SFAS No. 145. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 145 for all reporting periods subsequent to January 1, 2003. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146 “Accounting For Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” The statement requires costs associated with exit or disposal activities to be recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of the commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The requirements of SFAS No. 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after January 1, 2003. We will apply the provisions of this statement to all restructuring activity initiated after January 1, 2003. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation- Transition and Disclosure—an amendment of SFAS No. 123,” which provides optional transition guidance for those companies electing to voluntarily adopt the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123. In addition, the statement mandates certain new disclosures that are incremental to those required by SFAS No. 123. We will continue to account for stock-based compensation in accordance with APB No. 25. As such, we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We have adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 148 as of December 31, 2002. (See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements). In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation for Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51” which requires all variable interest entities (VIEs) to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interest in the VIE. In addition, the interpretation expands the disclosure requirements for both variable interest entities that are consolidated as well as VIEs from which the entity is the holder of a significant amount of beneficial interests, but not the majority. FIN 46 is effective for all VIE’s created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For VIE’s created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of this interpretation is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Information Presented Pursuant to the Indenture of Our 9 3/8% Senior Notes The following table sets forth information that is presented solely to address certain reporting requirements contained in the indenture for our senior notes. This information presents certain of our financial data on a consolidated basis and on a restricted group basis, as defined in the indenture governing the senior notes. All of our subsidiaries are part of the restricted group, except our wholly owned subsidiary Verestar. In December 2002, we committed to a plan to dispose of Verestar by sale within the next twelve months. Pursuant to that plan, the results of the operations related to Verestar are included in loss from discontinued operations, net of tax in our consolidated statements of operations and the assets and liabilities of Verestar are included in assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale, respectively, within the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2002. 43 Table of Contents Consolidated Restricted Group Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2002 2001 (In thousands) Statement of Operations Data: Operating revenues $ 788,420 $ 785,150 $ 788,420 $ 785,150 Operating expenses: Rental and management 228,519 211,811 228,519 211,811 Network development services 217,690 312,926 217,690 312,926 Depreciation and amortization 316,876 346,020 316,876 346,020 Corporate general and administrative expense 24,349 26,478 24,349 26,478 Restructuring expense 10,638 5,236 10,638 5,236 Development expense 5,896 7,895 5,896 7,895 Impairments and net loss on sale of long-lived assets 90,734 74,260 90,734 74,260 Total operating expenses 894,702 984,626 894,702 984,626 Operating loss from continuing operations (106,282 ) (199,476 ) (106,282 ) (199,476 ) Interest income, TV Azteca, net 13,938 14,377 13,938 14,377 Interest income 3,514 28,622 3,514 28,622 Interest expense (255,645 ) (267,825 ) (255,645 ) (267,825 ) Loss on investments and other expense (25,579 ) (38,797 ) (25,579 ) (38,797 ) Loss on term loan cancellation (7,231 ) (7,231 ) Note conversion expense (26,336 ) (26,336 ) Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries (2,118 ) (318 ) (2,118 ) (318 ) Loss from continuing operations before income taxes (379,403 ) (489,753 ) (379,403 ) (489,753 ) Income tax benefit 64,634 99,875 64,634 99,875 Loss from continuing operations before extraordinary losses and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (314,769 ) (389,878 ) (314,769 ) (389,878 ) Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (263,427 ) (60,216 ) (21,852 ) (9,251 ) Loss before extraordinary losses and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle $ (578,196 ) $ (450,094 ) $ (336,621 ) $ (399,129 ) December 31, 2002 Consolidated Restricted Group (In thousands) Balance Sheet Data: Cash and cash equivalents $ 127,292 $ 127,292 Assets held for sale 234,724 39,026 Property and equipment, net 2,734,885 2,734,885 Total assets 5,662,203 5,466,505 Long-term obligations, including current portion 3,464,679 3,464,679 Liabilities held for sale 165,006 2,525 Total stockholders’ equity 1,740,323 1,740,323 44 Table of Contents Information Presented Pursuant to the Indentures of Our 9 3/8% Senior Notes and Our 12.25% Senior Subordinated Discount Notes The following table sets forth information that is presented solely to address certain tower cash flow reporting requirements contained in the indentures for our senior and discount notes.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long-term debt obligations. We attempt to reduce these risks by utilizing derivative financial instruments, namely interest rate caps, swaps, and collars pursuant to our policies. All derivative financial instruments are for purposes other than trading. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we increased our borrowings under our credit facilities by $65.0 million. We also terminated two swaps with aggregate notional amounts totaling $150.0 million and caps with total notional amounts of $365.0 million expired. In addition, swaps with total notional amounts of $30.0 million and a collar with a total notional amount of $95.0 million expired. Lastly, we entered into four cap agreements with total notional amounts of $500.0 million. The following tables provide information as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates. For long-term debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows by maturity date and average interest rates related to outstanding obligations. For interest rate caps, swaps and collars, the tables present notional principal amounts and weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.

Interest on the credit facilities is payable in accordance with the applicable London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the Base Rate plus margin (as defined). The average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2002 for the credit facilities was 4.48%. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the weighted average interest rate under the credit facilities was 4.41%. The 2.25% and 6.25% convertible notes each bear interest (after giving effect to the accretion of the original discount on the 2.25% convertible notes) at 6.25% per annum, which is payable semiannually on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The 5.0% convertible notes bear 46 Table of Contents interest at 5.0% per annum, which is payable semiannually on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The 9 3/8% senior notes bear interest at 9 3/8% per annum, which is payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year beginning August 1, 2001. Other debt consists of notes payable, capital leases and other obligations bearing interest at rates ranging from 7.09% to 12.00%, payable monthly. As of December 31, 2001 variable rate debt consists of our credit facilities ($1.45 billion) and fixed rate debt consists of the 2.25% convertible notes ($204.2 million) and 6.25% convertible notes ($212.7 million), the 5.0% convertible notes ($450.0 million), the 9 3/8% senior notes ($1.0 billion) and other debt of $250.1 million. The average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2001 for the credit facilities was 4.76%. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the weighted average interest rate under the credit facilities was 7.26%. The 2.25% and 6.25% convertible notes each bear interest (after giving effect to the accretion of the original discount on the 2.25% convertible notes) at 6.25% per annum, which is payable semiannually on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The 5.0% convertible notes bear interest at 5.0% per annum, which is payable semiannually on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The 9 3/8% senior notes bear interest at 9 3/8% per annum, which is payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year beginning August 1, 2001. Other debt consists of notes payable, capital leases and other obligations bearing interest at rates ranging from 7.09% to 12.00%, payable monthly. (b) Represents the weighted-average fixed rate or range of interest based on contract notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts in a given year. (c) Includes notional amounts of $125,000, $250,000 and $125,000 that will expire in May, June and July 2004, respectively. (d) Includes notional amounts of $215,000 and $185,000 that will expire in February and November 2003, respectively. (e) Includes notional amounts of $185,000 and $47,500 that will expire in May and June 2003, respectively. (f) Includes notional amount of $364,980 that expired in February 2002. (g) Includes notional amount of $30,000 that expired in March 2002. (h) Includes notional amounts of $75,000, $290,000 and $185,000 that will expire in January, February and November 2003, respectively. (i) Includes notional amount of $95,000 that expired in July 2002. We maintain a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in short-term financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risks. Due to the relatively short duration of such instruments, we believe fluctuations in interest rates with respect to those investments will not materially affect our financial condition or results of operations. Our foreign operations, which primarily include Mexico, have not been significant to date. The remeasurement loss (gain) for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 approximated $3,713,000, $(207,000) and 11,000, respectively.",2023-12-30 19:23:32.798706
1053507,AMT,AMERICAN TOWER CORP /MA/,2016,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the accompanying notes, and the information set forth under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” below.During the fourth quarter of 2015, as a result of recent investment activity, including signed acquisitions, we reviewed and changed our reportable segments to divide our international segment into regional segments. We now operate in five reportable segments: U.S. property, Asia property, EMEA property, Latin America property and services. In evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses, among other factors, segment gross margin and segment operating profit (see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included herein). Executive OverviewWe are one of the largest global REITs and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. We refer to this business as our property operations, which accounted for 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 and includes our U.S. property segment, Asia property segment, EMEA property segment and Latin America property segment.We also offer tower-related services, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting and structural analysis services, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. 24Table of ContentsThe following table details the number of communications sites, excluding managed sites, we owned or operated as of December 31, 2015: Number ofOwned Towers Number ofOperated Towers (1) Number ofOwned DAS SitesDomestic: United States 21,854 18,235 337Asia: India 15,046 — 28EMEA: Germany 2,028 — —Ghana 2,097 — 16Nigeria 4,716 — —South Africa 1,926 — —Uganda 1,393 — —EMEA total 12,160 — 16Latin America: Brazil 15,758 2,268 47Chile 1,195 — 6Colombia 3,026 706 1Costa Rica 483 — —Mexico 8,591 199 49Peru 610 — —Latin America total 29,6633,173 103_______________(1)Approximately 97% of the operated towers are held pursuant to long-term capital leases, including those subject to purchase options. On October 21, 2015, we signed a definitive agreement pursuant to which we expect to acquire a 51% controlling ownership interest in Viom, a telecommunications infrastructure company that owns and operates over 42,000 wireless communications towers and 200 indoor DAS networks in India. Upon closing, we expect to consolidate the full financial results for Viom.The majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers have an initial non-cancellable term of at least ten years, with multiple renewal terms. Accordingly, nearly all of the revenue generated by our property operations during the year ended December 31, 2015 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2015, we expect to generate over $30 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, absent the impact of straight-line lease accounting. Most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually based on a fixed escalation (approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in our international markets, or a combination of both. In addition, certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs.The revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts, which typically are non-cancellable; however, in some instances, a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee.Revenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their terms or rent negotiations historically has not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our property operations. During the year ended December 31, 2015, loss of revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented less than 2% of our property operations revenues.Property Operations Revenue Growth. Due to our diversified communications site portfolio, our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount and type of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. We measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting 25Table of Contentsregulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. In many instances, tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation expenditures.The primary factors affecting the revenue growth in our property segments are:•Organic revenue from tenant leases attributable to sites that existed in our portfolio as of the beginning of the prior year period (“legacy sites”);•Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of churn;•New revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our legacy sites; and•New revenue attributable to sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior year period (“new sites”).We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our wireless real estate. By adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, we are able to increase these sites’ utilization and profitability. We believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers. Our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks, while also deploying next generation wireless technologies. In addition, we intend to continue to supplement the organic growth on our legacy sites by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk-adjusted return on investment objectives. In a majority of our international markets, revenue also often includes the reimbursement of direct costs such as ground rent or power and fuel costs.Property Operations Organic Revenue Growth. Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our legacy sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through collocation and lease amendments. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless services, the penetration of advanced wireless devices, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions. Based on industry research and projections, we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us:•In less advanced wireless markets where initial voice and data networks are still being deployed, we expect these deployments to drive demand for our tower space as carriers seek to expand their footprints and increase the scope and density of their networks. We have established operations in many of these markets at the early stages of wireless development, which we believe will enable us to meaningfully participate in these deployments.•Subscribers’ use of wireless data continues to grow rapidly given increasing smartphone and other advanced device penetration, the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications on these devices and the continuing evolution of the mobile ecosystem. We believe carriers will be compelled to deploy additional equipment on existing networks while also rolling out more advanced wireless networks to address coverage and capacity needs resulting from this increasing wireless data usage.•The deployment of advanced wireless technology across existing wireless networks will provide higher speed data services and further enable fixed broadband substitution. As a result, we expect our tenants to continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks.•Wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their existing wireless networks, which is driven by capacity and coverage. To maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases, our tenants continue deploying additional equipment across their existing sites while also adding new cell sites. We anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years, as existing network infrastructure is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage. •Wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum, and as a result are expected to add additional sites and equipment to their network as they seek to optimize their network configuration and utilize additional spectrum.As part of our international expansion initiatives, we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over 26Table of Contentsthe long term. In addition, we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers such as Airtel, Telefónica S.A. and Vodafone Group PLC. We believe that consistent carrier investments in their networks across our international markets position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward.In emerging markets, such as Ghana, India, Nigeria and Uganda, wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the United States, and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in underdeveloped areas. A majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services, predominantly on feature phones, while advanced device penetration remains low. In more developed urban locations within these markets, early-stage data network deployments are underway. Carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while also investing in initial data networks as wireless data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate. In markets with rapidly evolving network technology, such as South Africa and most of the countries in Latin America where we do business, initial voice networks, for the most part, have already been built out, and carriers are focused on 3G network build outs, with select investments in 4G technology. Consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices, and as a result, the usage of bandwidth-intensive mobile applications is growing materially. Recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks. Smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are growing rapidly, which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks in order to maintain and augment their quality of service.Finally, in markets with more mature network technology, such as Germany, carriers are focused on deploying 4G data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage amongst their customer base. With higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage, carrier investment in networks is focused on 4G coverage and capacity.We believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the United States, which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years, will ultimately be replicated in our less advanced international markets. As a result, we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 60,190 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier customers to drive sustainable, long-term growth.We have holistic master lease agreements with certain of our tenants that provide for consistent, long-term revenue and a reduction in the likelihood of churn. Our holistic master lease agreements build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced collocation cycle times, thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites.Property Operations New Site Revenue Growth. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 25,370 sites. In a majority of our Asia, EMEA and Latin America markets, the acquisition or construction of new sites resulted in increases in both tenant and pass-through revenues (such as ground rent or power and fuel costs) and expenses. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios, both domestically and internationally, to determine whether they meet our risk-adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio. New Sites (Acquired or Constructed)2015 2014 2013U.S.11,595 900 5,260Asia2,330 1,560 1,260EMEA4,910 190 485Latin America6,535 5,800 6,065Property Operations Expenses. Direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes, repairs and maintenance. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled Selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our property segments’ selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow. We may, however, incur additional segment 27Table of Contentsselling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities.Services Segment Revenue Growth. As we continue to focus on growing our property operations, we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIncluded in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (“Adjusted EBITDA”), Funds From Operations, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT FFO”) and Adjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO”).We define Adjusted EBITDA as Net income before Income (loss) on equity method investments; Income tax benefit (provision); Other income (expense); Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; Interest expense; Interest income; Other operating income (expense); Depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense.NAREIT FFO is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interest.We define AFFO as NAREIT FFO before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) the non-cash portion of our tax provision; (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion; (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges; (vi) other income (expense); (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; (viii) other operating income (expense); and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interest, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures.We present AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2015 before the one-time cash charge incurred in connection with a tax election, pursuant to which one of our subsidiaries no longer operates as a separate REIT, as it is nonrecurring and we do not believe it is an indication of our operating performance.Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO and AFFO are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Neither NAREIT FFO nor AFFO represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO and AFFO are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for purposes of decision making and for evaluating the performance of our operating segments; (2) Adjusted EBITDA is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain debt covenants; (3) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the tower industry to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4) each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (5) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies.Our measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO and AFFO may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO and AFFO to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included below.28Table of ContentsResults of OperationsYears Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except percentages)Revenue Year Ended December 31, % Change 2015 vs 2014 % Change 2014 vs 2013 2015 2014 2013 Property U.S.$3,157,501 $2,639,790 $2,189,365 20 % 21%Asia242,223 219,566 191,355 10 15EMEA395,092 315,053 295,681 25 7Latin America885,572 832,445 610,689 6 36Total property4,680,388 4,006,854 3,287,090 17 22Services91,128 93,194 74,317 (2) 25Total revenues$4,771,516 $4,100,048 $3,361,407 16 % 22%For the year ended December 31, 2015: •The increase in U.S. property segment revenue was primarily attributable to growth of (i) 11% due to 11,449 new sites from the Verizon Transaction, which resulted in an increase of $296.8 million in revenue and (ii) 7% from legacy sites, including 6% from new tenant leases and amendments to existing tenant leases and 1% from contractual rent escalations, net of churn.

The EMEA property SG&A increase included an increase in bad debt expense and was partially offset by a decrease attributable to the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations.31Table of ContentsThe decrease in our Latin America property segment SG&A was primarily due to the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by increased personnel costs to support the growth of our business and an increase in bad debt expense.The increase in services segment SG&A was primarily due to increased personnel costs. The increase in other SG&A was due to an increase in corporate SG&A of $16.7 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $10.2 million. Corporate SG&A reflects an increase in legal costs, as corporate SG&A during the year ended December 31, 2014 was favorably impacted by the recovery of legal expenses. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015, corporate SG&A increased due to an increase in personnel costs to support our business.Year Ended December 31, 2014 The increases in our property segments’ SG&A were primarily driven by increasing personnel costs to support our business, including additional costs associated with our acquisitions, such as MIPT in our U.S. property segment. U.S. property segment SG&A also included an increase of $11.0 million associated with project cancellation costs. The Asia, EMEA and Latin America property segment SG&A increases were partially offset by decreases attributable to impacts of foreign currency fluctuations. In each of our Latin America and EMEA property segments, the increase was partially offset by the reversal of bad debt expense for amounts previously reserved. The increase in services segment SG&A was primarily due to higher personnel costs related to the additional site acquisition, zoning and permitting services associated with certain tenants’ next generation technology network upgrade projects, including an increase in volume as a result of the additional sites acquired as part of the acquisition of MIPT.The decrease in other SG&A was primarily due to a decrease in corporate SG&A of $15.5 million, which was partially offset by an increase of $11.7 million related to stock-based compensation expense. The decrease in corporate SG&A was primarily related to a reduction in legal expenses of $22.5 million, including the recovery of expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014, and the reversal of a $2.8 million reserve associated with a non-recurring state tax item. The decrease in corporate SG&A was partially offset by an increase in personnel costs to support our business.

The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2014 was due to a payment from TV Azteca received during the year ended December 31, 2013, which included $28.0 million of principal on notes receivable, related interest and a prepayment penalty of $4.9 million. In addition, we recorded additional interest income of $2.7 million related to the write-off of a portion of the unamortized discount associated with the original notes receivable.

During the year ended December 31, 2014, we paid prepayment consideration primarily in connection with the prepayment of certain assumed debt, which was partially offset by the write-off of unamortized premium associated with the fair value adjustments of assumed debt. In addition, we recorded a loss of $1.4 million as a result of settling a previously existing interest rate swap agreement in Colombia.During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a loss of $35.3 million due to the repayment of $1.75 billion of secured debt and incurred prepayment consideration and recorded the acceleration of deferred financing costs.

As a REIT, we may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated by our REIT operations. In addition, we are able to offset certain income by utilizing our NOLs, subject to specified limitations.Effective July 25, 2015, we filed a tax election, pursuant to which MIPT no longer operates as a separate REIT for federal and state income tax purposes. In connection with this and related elections, we incurred a one-time cash tax charge of $93.0 million and a one-time deferred income tax benefit of $5.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. We also recorded a charge of $13.1 million resulting from a change in income tax law in Ghana. 34Table of ContentsThe ETR for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 included an expense of $2.6 million and $21.5 million, respectively, resulting from the restructuring of certain of our domestic TRSs.Net Income/Adjusted EBITDA Year Ended December 31, % Change 2015 vs 2014 % Change 2014 vs 2013 2015 2014 2013 Net income $672,007 $803,199 $482,208 (16)% 67 %Income tax provision 157,955 62,505 59,541 153 5Other expense 134,960 62,060 207,500 117 (70)Loss on retirement of long-term obligations 79,606 3,473 38,701 2,192 (91)Interest expense 595,949 580,234 458,296 3 27Interest income (16,479) (14,002) (9,706) 18 44Other operating expenses 66,696 68,517 71,539 (3) (4)Depreciation, amortization and accretion 1,285,328 1,003,802 800,145 28 25Stock-based compensation expense 90,537 80,153 68,138 13 18Adjusted EBITDA $3,066,559 $2,649,941 $2,176,362 16 % 22 %Year Ended December 31, 2015 The decrease in net income was primarily due to increases in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, income tax provision, loss on retirement of long-term obligations, other expenses, other SG&A and interest expense, which were partially offset by an increase in our operating profit.The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin and was partially offset by an increase in SG&A of $41.1 million, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense.Year Ended December 31, 2014 The increase in net income was primarily due to the increase in our operating profit, as well as decreases in other expense and loss on retirement of long-term obligations.

Accordingly, we present AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2015 before this charge.AFFO growth for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to the increase in our operating profit and was partially offset by increases in dividends on preferred stock, corporate SG&A and a net increase in capital improvement and corporate capital expenditures.AFFO growth for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to the increase in our operating profit and a decrease in capital improvement and corporate capital expenditures, partially offset by increases in cash paid for interest and taxes and dividends on preferred stock.36Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOverviewDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we increased our financial flexibility and our ability to grow our business while maintaining our long-term financial policies. Our significant 2015 financing transactions included:•The issuance of 13,750,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/10th interest in a share of the Series B Preferred Stock, and 25,850,000 shares of common stock. We used the aggregate net proceeds of $3.78 billion to fund a portion of the Verizon Transaction.•The completion of registered public offerings of $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.800% senior unsecured notes due 2020 (the “2.800% Notes”) and $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.000% senior unsecured notes due 2025 (the “4.000% Notes”). We used the net proceeds of $1.48 billion to repay existing indebtedness under our multi-currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility entered into in June 2013, as amended (the “2013 Credit Facility”).•The receipt of incremental commitments under the 2013 Credit Facility and our senior unsecured credit facility entered into in January 2012, as amended and restated in September 2014 (the “2014 Credit Facility”), giving us the ability to borrow up to $2.75 billion under the 2013 Credit Facility and $2.0 billion under the 2014 Credit Facility.•The repayment of the Secured Tower Revenue Notes, Global Tower Series 2011-1, Class C, Secured Tower Revenue Notes, Global Tower Series 2011-2, Class C and Class F and Secured Tower Revenue Notes, Global Tower Series 2013-1, Class C and Class F (collectively, the “GTP AP Notes”) with proceeds from the 2015 Securitization.As a holding company, our cash flows are derived primarily from the operations of, and distributions from, our operating subsidiaries or funds raised through borrowings under our credit facilities and debt or equity offerings.

As a result, our liquidity increased by $1.2 billion.Summary cash flow information is set forth below for the years ended December 31, (in thousands): 2015 2014 2013Net cash provided by (used for): Operating activities$2,183,052 $2,134,589 $1,599,047Investing activities(7,741,735) (1,949,548) (5,173,337)Financing activities5,589,101 (134,591) 3,525,565Net effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents(23,224) (30,534) (26,317)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$7,194 $19,916 $(75,042)We use our cash flows to fund our operations and investments in our business, including tower maintenance and improvements, communications site construction and managed network installations and tower and land acquisitions. Additionally, we use our cash flows to make distributions, including distributions of our REIT taxable income to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We may also repay or repurchase our existing indebtedness from time to time. We typically fund our international expansion efforts primarily through a combination of cash on hand, intercompany debt and equity contributions.37Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2015, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $17.2 billion, with a current portion of $50.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and debt service obligations, as well as our required distributions. We believe the cash generated by operating activities during the year ending December 31, 2016, together with our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our required distributions, capital expenditures, debt service obligations (interest and principal repayments) and signed acquisitions. As of December 31, 2015, we had $223.5 million of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $68.1 million was held by our joint ventures. While certain subsidiaries may pay us interest or principal on intercompany debt, it has not been our practice to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs. However, in the event that we do repatriate any funds, we may be required to accrue and pay taxes.Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesAdjusted EBITDA growth of $416.6 million was offset by higher working capital as well as higher cash taxes and interest costs, resulting in a $48.5 million increase in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015. The primary factors that impacted cash provided by operating activities as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, include:•An increase of approximately $87.8 million in cash paid for taxes, driven primarily by the MIPT one-time cash tax charge of $93.0 million; •A decrease in capital contributions, tenant settlements and other prepayments of approximately $99.0 million;•An increase of approximately $29.9 million in cash paid for interest; •A decrease of approximately $34.9 million in termination and decommissioning fees;•A decrease of approximately $49.0 million in customer receipts due to timing; and•A decrease due to the non-recurrence of a 2014 value added tax refund of approximately $60.3 million.For the year ended December 31, 2014, cash provided by operating activities increased $535.5 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the operating profit of our property segments, cash provided by working capital and a decrease in restricted cash, partially offset by increases in cash paid for interest and taxes. Working capital was positively impacted by the receipt of capital contributions from tenants and a value added tax refund, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesOur significant investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 are highlighted below: •We spent $5.059 billion for the Verizon Transaction.•We spent $796.9 million for the acquisition of 5,483 communications sites from TIM in Brazil.•We spent $1.1 billion for the acquisition of 4,716 communications sites from certain of Airtel’s subsidiaries in Nigeria.•We spent $728.8 million for capital expenditures, as follows (in millions):Discretionary capital projects (1)$245.1Ground lease purchases140.5Capital improvements and corporate expenditures106.3Redevelopment162.1Start-up capital projects74.8Total capital expenditures$728.8_______________(1)Includes the construction of 3,235 communications sites globally and the installation of 17 shared generators domestically.Our significant investing transactions in 2014 included the following: •We completed the acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of BR Towers for a preliminary purchase price of $568.9 million, net of debt assumed and outstanding preferred stock. 38Table of Contents•We spent $441.7 million for the acquisition of approximately 400 communications sites in Brazil, Ghana, Mexico, Uganda and the United States, as well as to satisfy obligations related to sites acquired during the year ended December 31, 2013 in Brazil, South Africa and the United States.•We spent $974.4 million for capital expenditures, as follows (in millions): Discretionary capital projects (1)$521.6Ground lease purchases133.7Capital improvements and corporate expenditures99.2Redevelopment194.4Start-up capital projects25.5Total capital expenditures$974.4_______________(1)Includes the construction of 3,133 communications sites globally and the installation of 530 shared generators domestically.We plan to continue to allocate our available capital, after satisfying our distribution requirements, among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria, while taking into account the repayment of debt, as necessary, consistent with our long-term financial policies. Accordingly, we expect to continue to deploy our capital through our annual capital expenditure program, including land purchases and new site construction, and through acquisitions.

On May 29, 2015, GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC (“GTP Acquisition Partners”), one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, repaid all amounts outstanding under the GTP AP Notes, plus prepayment consideration and other costs and expenses related thereto, with cash on hand and proceeds from the issuance of $350.0 million of American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1, Class A (the “Series 2015-1 Notes”) and $525.0 million of American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the “Series 39Table of Contents2015-2 Notes,” and, together with the Series 2015-1 Notes, the “2015 Notes”) in the 2015 Securitization. The 2015 Notes were issued by GTP Acquisition Partners pursuant to a Third Amended and Restated Indenture and related series supplements, each dated as of May 29, 2015 (collectively, the “2015 Indenture”), between GTP Acquisition Partners and its subsidiaries (the “GTP Entities”) and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee. The Series 2015-1 Notes have an interest rate of 2.350%, an anticipated repayment date of June 15, 2020 and a final repayment date of June 15, 2045. The Series 2015-2 Notes have an interest rate of 3.482%, an anticipated repayment date of June 16, 2025 and a final repayment date of June 15, 2050. Amounts due under the 2015 Notes will be paid solely from the cash flows generated from the operation of the 3,609 2015 Secured Sites. GTP Acquisition Partners is required to make monthly payments of interest on the 2015 Notes, commencing in July 2015. Subject to certain limited exceptions (described below), no payments of principal will be required to be made prior to June 15, 2020, which is the anticipated repayment date for the Series 2015-1 Notes.The 2015 Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, provided such payment is accompanied by the applicable prepayment consideration. If prepayment occurs within 12 months of the anticipated repayment date with respect to the Series 2015-1 Notes, or 18 months of the anticipated repayment date with respect to the Series 2015-2 Notes, no prepayment consideration is due. If the Series 2015-1 Notes or the Series 2015-2 Notes have not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the applicable series of the 2015 Notes and such series will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow. The 2015 Notes are secured by (i) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the 2015 Secured Sites and their operating cash flows, (ii) a security interest in substantially all of the personal property and fixtures of the GTP Entities, including GTP Acquisition Partners’ equity interests in its subsidiaries and (iii) the rights of the GTP Entities under a management agreement. American Tower Holding Sub II, LLC, whose only material assets are its equity interests in GTP Acquisition Partners, has guaranteed repayment of the 2015 Notes and pledged its equity interests in GTP Acquisition Partners as security for such payment obligations. The 2015 Indenture includes covenants and other restrictions customary for notes issued in rated securitizations. Among other things, the GTP Entities are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. The organizational documents of the GTP Entities contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities, including the requirement that they maintain independent directors. The 2015 Indenture also contains certain covenants that require GTP Acquisition Partners to provide the trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets, promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the Indenture and other agreements related to the 2015 Secured Sites and allow the trustee reasonable access to the 2015 Secured Sites, including the right to conduct site investigations. Further, under the 2015 Indenture, GTP Acquisition Partners is required to maintain reserve accounts, including for amounts received or due from tenants related to future periods, property taxes, insurance, ground rents, certain expenses and debt service.

Accrued and unpaid interest on the notes will be payable in U.S. Dollars semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2015. Interest on the notes is computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months and commenced accruing on May 7, 2015. 3.300% Senior Notes and 4.400% Senior Notes Offering. On January 12, 2016, we completed a registered public offering of $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.300% Notes and $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.400% Notes. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $1,237.2 million, after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. We used the proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under the 2013 Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes.The 3.300% Notes will mature on February 15, 2021 and bear interest at a rate of 3.300% per annum. The 4.400% Notes will mature on February 15, 2026 and bear interest at a rate of 4.400% per annum. Accrued and unpaid interest on the notes will be payable in U.S. Dollars semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2016. Interest on the notes is computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months and commenced accruing on January 12, 2016. We may redeem each series of the notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date. If we redeem the 2.800% Notes on or after May 1, 2020, the 4.000% Notes on or after March 1, 2025, the 3.300% Notes on or after January 15, 2021 or the 4.400% Notes on or after November 15, 2025, we will not be required to pay a make-whole premium. In addition, if we undergo a change of control and corresponding ratings decline, each as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture, we may be required to repurchase all of the applicable notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if any), up to but not including the repurchase date. Each of the notes rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries. Each of the applicable supplemental indentures for the 2.800% Notes, the 4.000% Notes, the 3.300% Notes and the 4.400% Notes contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and our (together with our subsidiaries’) ability to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that we, and our subsidiaries, may incur certain liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness, if the aggregate amount of such liens does not exceed 3.5x Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture.Bank Facilities In February 2015, we entered into amendment agreements with respect to the (i) Term Loan, (ii) 2013 Credit Facility and (iii) 2014 Credit Facility. After giving effect to these amendments, our permitted ratio of Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the loan agreements for each of the facilities) is (i) 7.00 to 1.00 for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 and (ii) 6.00 to 1.00 thereafter. In addition, we increased the maximum Incremental Term Loan 41Table of ContentsCommitments (as defined in the agreement governing the Term Loan) to $1.0 billion and increased the maximum Revolving Loan Commitments, after giving effect to any Incremental Commitments (each as defined in the loan agreements for each of the revolving credit facilities) to $3.5 billion and $2.5 billion under the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility, respectively. Effective October 28, 2015, we entered into additional amendment agreements to the Term Loan, the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility, which, among other things, (i) extended the maturity dates to January 29, 2021, June 28, 2019 and January 29, 2021, respectively, and (ii) increased the threshold for certain defaults with respect to judgments, attachments or acceleration of indebtedness from $250.0 million to $300.0 million. All of the other material terms of the Term Loan, the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility remain in full force and effect.Term Loan. Effective February 20, 2015, we borrowed an additional $500.0 million under the Term Loan. As a result, we have $2.0 billion outstanding under the Term Loan. 2013 Credit Facility. On February 20, 2015, we received incremental commitments of $750.0 million and, as a result, have the ability to borrow up to $2.75 billion under the 2013 Credit Facility, which includes a $1.0 billion sublimit for multicurrency borrowings, a $200.0 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $50.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we borrowed an aggregate of $4.0 billion and repaid an aggregate of $2.7 billion of revolving indebtedness under the 2013 Credit Facility. We primarily used the borrowings to (i) fund a portion of the Verizon Transaction, (ii) fund the Airtel acquisition, (iii) fund the TIM acquisition and (iv) repay other indebtedness. We currently have $3.2 million of undrawn letters of credit and maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the 2013 Credit Facility in the ordinary course.2014 Credit Facility. On February 20, 2015, we received incremental commitments of $500.0 million and, as a result, have the ability to borrow up to $2.0 billion under the 2014 Credit Facility, which includes a $200.0 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $50.0 million sublimit for swingline loans.During the year ended December 31, 2015, we borrowed an aggregate of $2.1 billion and repaid an aggregate of $1.3 billion of revolving indebtedness under the 2014 Credit Facility. We primarily used the borrowings to fund a portion of the Verizon Transaction. We currently have $7.4 million of undrawn letters of credit and maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the 2014 Credit Facility in the ordinary course.The Term Loan, the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility do not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. We have the option of choosing either a defined base rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) as the applicable base rate for borrowings under the Term Loan, the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility. The interest rates range between 1.000% to 2.000% above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or up to 1.000% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based upon our debt ratings. The margin over LIBOR for each of the Term Loan, the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility is 1.250%.The 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility are subject to two optional renewal periods. A quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility is required, ranging from 0.100% to 0.400% per annum, based upon our debt ratings, and is currently 0.150%.The loan agreements for each of the Term Loan, the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility contain certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply. Failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreements could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facilities, but may constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable.Redemption of Senior Notes. On February 11, 2015, we redeemed all of the outstanding 4.625% Notes at a price equal to 100.5898% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest up to, but excluding, February 11, 2015, for an aggregate redemption price of $613.6 million, including $10.0 million in accrued and unpaid interest. On April 29, 2015, we redeemed all of the outstanding 7.000% Notes at a price equal to 114.0629% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, April 29, 2015, for an aggregate redemption price of $571.7 million, including $1.4 million in accrued and unpaid interest. These redemptions were funded with borrowings under our 42Table of Contentsexisting credit facilities and cash on hand. Upon completion of these redemptions, none of the 4.625% Notes or the 7.000% Notes remained outstanding. Stock Repurchase Program. In March 2011, our Board of Directors approved a $1.5 billion stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to purchase up to an additional $1.1 billion of our common stock. Since September 2013, we have temporarily suspended repurchases under the program. Sales of Equity Securities. We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plans. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we received an aggregate of $50.7 million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and from the ESPP.Distributions. As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we have distributed, and expect to continue to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income after taking into consideration our utilization of NOLs. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. We have two series of preferred stock outstanding, the Series A Preferred Stock, with a dividend rate of 5.25%, and the Series B Preferred Stock, with a dividend rate of 5.50%. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears, subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid an aggregate of:•$5.25 per share, or $31.6 million, to Series A preferred stockholders of record, including the fourth quarter dividend of $1.3125 per share, or $7.9 million, and •$38.6528 per share, or $53.1 million, to Series B preferred stockholders of record, including the fourth quarter dividend of $13.75 per share, or $18.9 million.In addition, on February 16, 2016, we paid dividends of $1.3125 per share, or $7.9 million, to Series A preferred stockholders of record at the close of business on February 1, 2016 and $13.75 per share, or $18.9 million, to Series B preferred stockholders of record at the close of business on February 1, 2016.During the year ended December 31, 2015, we declared an aggregate of $766.4 million in regular cash distributions payable to our common stockholders, which included our fourth quarter distribution of $0.49 per share ($207.7 million) payable on January 13, 2016 to common stockholders of record at the close of business on December 16, 2015. We accrue distributions on unvested restricted stock units, which are payable upon vesting. As of December 31, 2015, the amount accrued for distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units was $5.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid $1.3 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units. For more details on the cash distributions paid to our common and preferred stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2015, see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.Contractual Obligations.

(15)Excludes $14.7 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and $16.7 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled. Settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe. However, based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements, we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Our liquidity is dependent on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities, borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness. We believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants, our compliance with which would be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity. Internally Generated Funds. Because the majority of our tenant leases are multi-year contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2015 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites. Restrictions Under Loan Agreements Relating to Our Credit Facilities. The loan agreements for the 2014 Credit Facility, the 2013 Credit Facility and the Term Loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreements also contain covenants that establish three financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage, as set forth in the table below. In the event that our debt ratings fall below investment grade, we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense (each as defined in the applicable loan agreement) of at least 2.50:1.00. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. Compliance Tests For 12 Months Ended December 31, 2015 ($ in billions) Ratio (1) Additional Debt Capacity Under Covenants (2) Capacity for Adjusted EBITDA Decrease Under Covenants (3)Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 7.00:1.00 (4) ~ $5.3 ~ $0.8Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio Senior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 3.00:1.00 ~ $6.1 (5) ~ $2.0 (5)_______________(1) Each component of the ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement.(2) Assumes no change to Adjusted EBITDA.(3) Assumes no change to our existing debt levels. (4)The required ratio is ≤ 7.00:1.00 for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 and ≤ 6.00:1.00 thereafter. If the required ratio as of December 31, 2015 had been ≤6.00: 1.00, our additional debt capacity would have been $2.1 billion and our capacity for Adjusted EBITDA decrease would have been $0.3 billion.(5) Effectively, however, the capacity under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio. 45Table of ContentsThe loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants.Failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but may constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants.Restrictions Under Agreements Relating to the 2015 Securitization and the 2013 Securitization. The 2015 Indenture and the loan agreement related to the 2013 Securitization include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the “AMT Asset Subs”) and GTP Acquisition Partners are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the applicable agreement). Under the terms of the agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the 2015 Notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan that secures the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-1A and Series 2013-2A issued in the 2013 Securitization (the “Loan”), as applicable, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement, subject to the conditions described in the table below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs, as applicable, which can then be distributed to, and used by, us. As of December 31, 2015, $111.3 million held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash. Certain information with respect to each of the 2015 Securitization and the 2013 Securitization is set forth below ($ in millions). The debt service coverage ratio (“DSCR”) is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination.

(2)Once triggered, a Cash Trap DSCR condition continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters.46Table of Contents(3)An amortization period commences if the DSCR is equal to or below 1.15x (the “Minimum DSCR”) at the end of any calendar quarter and continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. (4)No amortization period is triggered if the outstanding principal amount of a series has not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date. However, in such event, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the applicable series, and such series will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow.(5)Includes amounts distributed pursuant to the GTP AP Notes prior to the repayment on May 29, 2015.(6)An amortization period exists if the outstanding principal amount has not been paid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date and continues to exist until such principal has been repaid in full. A failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions, meet REIT distribution requirements and make preferred stock dividend payments. During an “amortization period” all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve accounts because the DSCR was equal to or below the Cash Trap DSCR would be applied to pay principal of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, on each monthly payment date, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Further, additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any series of the 2015 Notes or subclass of Loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement. With respect to the 2015 Notes, upon occurrence and during an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of the 2015 Notes, declare such series of 2015 Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes. Furthermore, if GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs were to default on a series of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 3,609 2015 Secured Sites or the 5,186 2013 Secured Towers, respectively, in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assets.As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to repay or repurchase our outstanding indebtedness. In addition, in order to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and satisfy our distribution requirements, we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities. If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements, pay preferred stock dividends or refinance our existing indebtedness.In addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and, consequently, a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2015. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.•Impairment of Assets—Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization: We review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable. 47Table of ContentsWe review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements.We review our customer-related intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts, or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the customer-related intangible assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment.•Impairment of Assets—Goodwill: We review goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.Goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. We utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment and we employ a discounted cash flow analysis. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. Under the first step of this test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, we conduct the second step of this test, in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess.During the year ended December 31, 2015, no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test. The fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount by a substantial margin. •Asset Retirement Obligations: When required, we recognize the fair value of obligations to remove our tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of our tower assets are located. Generally, the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. We updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of $6.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The change in 2015 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary.•Acquisitions: For those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, we apply the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with those of the Company from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We continue to evaluate acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to 48Table of Contentsreplace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future customer cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition. •Revenue Recognition: Our revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is reasonably assured. Escalation clauses tied to the Consumer Price Index or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total property straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 approximated $155.0 million, $123.7 million and $147.7 million, respectively. Amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases. Amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met.We derive the largest portion of our revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, and 63% of our revenues are derived from four tenants in the industry. In addition, we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. We mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of our borrowers and tenants. In recognizing customer revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense. Accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured.•Rent Expense: Many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time. In addition, certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. We calculate straight-line ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. •Stock-Based Compensation: The fair value of a stock option is determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that takes into account a number of assumptions at the accounting measurement date including the stock price, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock, the expected distributions, and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. These assumptions are highly subjective and could significantly impact the value of the option and the compensation expense. In addition, the amount we record as stock-based compensation expense is required to include an estimate of the awards that will not fully vest and be forfeited. The fair value of both time-based and performance-based restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. We recognize stock-based compensation in either selling, general, administrative and development expense, costs of operations or as part of the costs associated with the construction of our tower assets.•Income Taxes: Accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes. To the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes, deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns, which may differ from the current rate. We do not expect to pay federal taxes on our REIT taxable income.We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes, if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability.49Table of ContentsWe recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination, which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit.We consider the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. Should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, we may have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside of the United States.Accounting Standards UpdateFor a discussion of recent accounting standards updates, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.50Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe following table provides information as of December 31, 2015 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates.

Variable rate debt also included: the BR Towers debentures, which amortize through October 15, 2023, the Uganda loan, which matures on June 29, 2019, the South African facility, which amortizes through December 17, 2020; the Colombian credit facility, which amortizes through April 24, 2021; and the Brazil credit facility, which matures on January 15, 2022. (c)Based on rates effective as of December 31, 2015.(d)Represents the weighted average fixed rate of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts.Interest Rate RiskWe have one interest rate swap agreement in Colombia as of December 31, 2015. The interest rate swap agreement has been designated as a cash flow hedge, has a notional amount of $30.2 million, an interest rate of 5.74% and expires in April 2021. Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2015 was comprised of $1,980.0 million under the 2014 Credit Facility, $1,225.0 million under the 2013 Credit Facility, $2,000.0 million under the Term Loan, $75.2 million under the Uganda loan, $53.7 million under the South African facility, $30.2 million under the Colombian credit facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreement, $85.2 million under the BR Towers debentures and $21.9 million under the Brazil credit facility. A 10% increase in current interest rates would result in an additional $10.8 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. Foreign Currency RiskWe are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar is reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of AOCI. We may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions in order to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. For the year ended December 31, 2015, 32% of our revenues and 36% of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies.As of December 31, 2015, we have incurred intercompany debt that is not considered to be permanently reinvested, and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As this debt had not been designated as being a long-term investment in nature, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. An adverse change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances 51Table of Contentswould result in $71.7 million of unrealized losses that would be included in Other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.",2023-12-30 19:23:38.031209
1053507,AMT,AMERICAN TOWER CORP /MA/,2017,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the accompanying notes, and the information set forth under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” below.We report our results in five segments: U.S. property, Asia property, EMEA property, Latin America property and Services. In evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses, among other factors, segment gross margin and segment operating profit (see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Executive OverviewWe are one of the largest global REITs and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure and property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. We refer to this business as our property operations, which accounted for 99% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and includes our U.S. property segment, Asia property segment, EMEA property segment and Latin America property segment.We also offer tower-related services, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting and structural analysis services, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. 26Table of ContentsThe following table details the number of communications sites, excluding managed sites, we owned or operated as of December 31, 2016: Number ofOwned Towers Number ofOperated Towers (1) Number ofOwned DAS SitesDomestic: United States 23,385 16,685 344Asia: India 57,687 — 258EMEA: Germany 2,201 — —Ghana 2,145 — 18Nigeria 4,742 — —South Africa 2,362 — —Uganda 1,393 — —EMEA total 12,843 — 18Latin America (2): Brazil 16,279 2,268 67Chile 1,253 — 8Colombia 3,067 706 1Costa Rica 486 — 1Mexico 8,616 199 68Peru 645 — —Latin America total 30,346 3,173 145_______________(1)Approximately 97% of the operated towers are held pursuant to long-term capital leases, including those subject to purchase options.(2)In Argentina, we own or operate urban telecommunications assets, fiber and the rights to utilize certain existing utility infrastructure for future telecommunications equipment installation. In general, our tenant leases with wireless carriers have an initial non-cancellable term of at least ten years, with multiple renewal terms. Accordingly, nearly all of the revenue generated by our property operations during the year ended December 31, 2016 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2016, we expect to generate over $31 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, absent the impact of straight-line lease accounting. Most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually based on a fixed escalation (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in our international markets, or a combination of both. In addition, certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs.The revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts, which typically are non-cancellable; however, in some instances, a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee.Revenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their terms or rent negotiations historically has not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our property operations. During the year ended December 31, 2016, loss of revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented less than 2% of our property operations revenues.Property Operations Revenue Growth. Due to our diversified communications site portfolio, our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. We measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. In many instances, tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation expenditures.The primary factors affecting the revenue growth in our property segments are:27Table of Contents•Growth in tenant billings, including:•New revenue attributable to leases in place on day one on sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior-year period;•New revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our sites (“colocations”) and lease amendments; and•Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of churn. •Revenue growth from other items, including additional tenant payments to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs (“pass-through”) included in certain tenant leases, straight-line revenue and decommissioning.We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our wireless real estate. By adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, we are able to increase these sites’ utilization and profitability. We believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks, while also deploying next generation wireless technologies. In addition, we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk-adjusted return on investment objectives. In our international markets, certain pass-through revenue amounts may fluctuate with changing power and fuel costs. Property Operations Organic Revenue Growth. Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless services, the penetration of advanced wireless devices, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions.Based on industry research and projections, we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us:•In less advanced wireless markets where initial voice and data networks are still being deployed, we expect these deployments to drive demand for our tower space as carriers seek to expand their footprints and increase the scope and density of their networks. We have established operations in many of these markets at the early stages of wireless development, which we believe will enable us to meaningfully participate in these deployments over the long term.•Subscribers’ use of wireless data continues to grow rapidly given increasing smartphone and other advanced device penetration, the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications on these devices and the continuing evolution of the mobile ecosystem. We believe carriers will be compelled to deploy additional equipment on existing networks while also rolling out more advanced wireless networks to address coverage and capacity needs resulting from this increasing wireless data usage.•The deployment of advanced wireless technology across existing wireless networks will provide higher speed data services and further enable fixed broadband substitution. As a result, we expect that our tenants will continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks.•Wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their existing wireless networks, which is driven by capacity and coverage. To maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases, our tenants continue deploying additional equipment across their existing sites while also adding new cell sites. We anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years, as existing network infrastructure is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage. •Wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum, and as a result are expected to add additional sites and equipment to their networks as they seek to optimize their network configuration and utilize additional spectrum.As part of our international expansion initiatives, we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term. In addition, we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers such as Airtel, Telefónica S.A. and Vodafone Group PLC. We believe that consistent carrier investments in their networks across our international markets position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward.28Table of ContentsIn emerging markets, such as Ghana, India, Nigeria and Uganda, wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the United States, and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in underdeveloped areas. A majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services, predominantly on feature phones, while advanced device penetration remains low. In more developed urban locations within these markets, early-stage data network deployments are underway. Carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while also investing in initial data networks as wireless data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate. In markets with rapidly evolving network technology, such as South Africa and most of the countries in Latin America where we do business, initial voice networks, for the most part, have already been built out, and carriers are focused on 3G and 4G network build outs. Consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices, and, as a result, the usage of bandwidth-intensive mobile applications is growing materially. Recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks. Smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are growing rapidly, which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks in order to maintain and augment their quality of service.Finally, in markets with more mature network technology, such as Germany and France, carriers are focused on deploying 4G data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their customer base. With higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage, carrier investment in networks is focused on 4G coverage and capacity.We believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the United States, which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years, will ultimately be replicated in our less advanced international markets. As a result, we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 104,470 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier customers to drive sustainable, long-term growth.We have master lease agreements with certain of our tenants that provide for consistent, long-term revenue and reduce the likelihood of churn. Our master lease agreements build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced colocation cycle times, thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites.Property Operations New Site Revenue Growth. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 45,310 sites. In a majority of our Asia, EMEA and Latin America markets, the revenue generated from newly acquired or constructed sites resulted in increases in both tenant and pass-through revenues (such as ground rent or power and fuel costs) and expenses. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios, both domestically and internationally, to determine whether they meet our risk-adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio. New Sites (Acquired or Constructed)2016 2015 2014U.S.65 11,595 900Asia43,865 2,330 1,560EMEA665 4,910 190Latin America715 6,535 5,800Property Operations Expenses. Direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes, repairs and maintenance. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled Selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our property segments’ selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our sites and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new tenants on our sites provides significant incremental cash flow. We may, however, incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our sites but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities.29Table of ContentsServices Segment Revenue Growth. As we continue to focus on growing our property operations, we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIncluded in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (“Adjusted EBITDA”), Funds From Operations, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT FFO”) attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations (“Consolidated AFFO”) and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders.We define Adjusted EBITDA as Net income before Income (loss) from equity method investments; Income tax benefit (provision); Other income (expense); Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; Interest expense; Interest income; Other operating income (expense); Depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense. NAREIT FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interest. In this section, we refer to NAREIT FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “NAREIT FFO (common stockholders).” We define Consolidated AFFO as NAREIT FFO (common stockholders) before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) the deferred portion of income tax; (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion; (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges; (vi) other income (expense); (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; (viii) other operating income (expense); and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interests, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures. We define AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2016 as Consolidated AFFO, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both NAREIT FFO (common stockholders) as well as the other adjustments included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. In this section, we refer to AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “AFFO (common stockholders).” Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. None of Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO or AFFO (common stockholders) represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or a measure of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for decision making purposes and for evaluating our operating segments’ performance; (2) Adjusted EBITDA is a component underlying our credit ratings; (3) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4) Consolidated AFFO is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to adjust NAREIT FFO (common stockholders) for items that may otherwise cause material fluctuations in NAREIT FFO (common stockholders) growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of property assets in those periods; (5) each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (6) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies, particularly those in our industry. Our measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included below.30Table of ContentsResults of OperationsYears Ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except percentages)Revenue Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2016 vs 2015 Percent Change 2015 vs 2014 2016 2015 2014 Property U.S.$3,370,033 $3,157,501 $2,639,790 7 % 20 %Asia827,627 242,223 219,566 242 10EMEA529,531 395,092 315,053 34 25Latin America985,935 885,572 832,445 11 6Total property5,713,126 4,680,388 4,006,854 22 17Services72,542 91,128 93,194 (20) (2)Total revenues$5,785,668 $4,771,516 $4,100,048 21 % 16 %Year ended December 31, 2016 - RevenueU.S. property segment revenue growth of $212.5 million, or 7%, was attributable to: • Tenant billings growth of $257.1 million, which was driven by:• $128.8 million due to colocations and amendments; • $91.3 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites, including sites associated with the Verizon Transaction; • $34.1 million from contractual escalations, net of churn; and• $2.9 million from other tenant billings.Segment revenue growth was partially offset by a decrease of $44.6 million, primarily due to the impact of straight-line accounting.Asia property segment revenue growth of $585.4 million, or 242%, was attributable to:• Tenant billings growth of $368.9 million, which was driven by:•$341.2 million generated from newly acquired sites, primarily due to the Viom Acquisition;•$22.2 million due to colocations and amendments; •$8.6 million generated from newly constructed sites; •Partially offset by,▪A decrease of $2.2 million from churn in excess of contractual escalations; ▪A decrease of $0.9 million from other tenant billings;• Pass-through revenue growth of $243.6 million, primarily due to the Viom Acquisition; and• $6.3 million of other revenue growth, primarily due to the impact of straight-line accounting.Segment revenue growth was partially offset by a decrease of $33.4 million attributable to the negative impact of foreign currency translation related to fluctuations in Indian Rupee (“INR”).EMEA property segment revenue growth of $134.4 million, or 34%, was attributable to:• Tenant billings growth of $124.1 million, which was driven by: •$82.8 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites, including sites acquired from Airtel in Nigeria;•$22.1 million due to colocations and amendments; •$17.4 million from contractual escalations, net of churn; • $1.8 million from other tenant billings; and• Pass-through revenue growth of $65.6 million; •Partially offset by a decrease of $4.6 million, attributable in part to the impact of straight-line accounting.31Table of ContentsSegment revenue growth was partially offset by a decrease of $50.7 million attributable to the negative impact of foreign currency translation, which included, among others, $29.0 million related to fluctuations in Nigerian Naira (“NGN”), $12.1 million related to fluctuations in South African Rand (“ZAR”) and $5.5 million related to fluctuations in Ghanaian Cedi (“GHS”).Latin America property segment revenue growth of $100.4 million, or 11%, was attributable to:• Tenant billings growth of $131.3 million, which was driven by:•$49.5 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites;•$42.5 million from contractual escalations, net of churn; •$37.2 million due to colocations and amendments; •$2.1 million from other tenant billings; • Pass-through revenue growth of $60.6 million; and•An increase of $5.7 million in other revenue, primarily due to a $12.8 million impact of straight-line accounting offset in part by a $7.0 million reduction in revenue resulting from a judicial reorganization of a tenant in Brazil.

Additionally, we use our cash flows to make distributions, including distributions of our REIT taxable income to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We may also repay or repurchase our existing indebtedness from time to time. We typically fund our international expansion efforts primarily through a combination of cash on hand, intercompany debt and equity contributions.40Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2016, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $18.7 billion, with a current portion of $238.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and debt service obligations, as well as our required distributions. We believe the cash generated by operating activities during the year ending December 31, 2017 will be sufficient to fund our required distributions, capital expenditures, debt service obligations (interest and principal repayments) and signed acquisitions. As of December 31, 2016, we had $423.0 million of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $183.9 million was held by our joint ventures. While certain subsidiaries may pay us interest or principal on intercompany debt, it has not been our practice to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs. However, in the event that we do repatriate any funds, we may be required to accrue and pay taxes.Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesFor the year ended December 31, 2016, cash provided by operating activities increased $520.6 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.

On September 30, 2016, we completed registered public offerings of the 2.250% Notes and the 3.125% Notes. The net proceeds from these offerings were approximately $990.6 million, after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. We used the proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under the Term Loan.The 2.250% Notes will mature on January 15, 2022 and bear interest at a rate of 2.250% per annum.

Interest on the notes is computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months and commenced accruing on September 30, 2016. We entered into interest rate swaps, which were designated as fair value hedges at inception, to hedge against changes in fair value of the debt under the 2.250% Notes resulting from changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2016, the interest rate on the 2.250% Notes, after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements, was 1.97%. We may redeem each series of notes at any time, subject to the terms of the applicable supplemental indenture, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date. If we redeem the 3.300% Notes on or after January 15, 2021, the 4.400% Notes on or after November 15, 2025, the 3.375% Notes on or after July 15, 2026 or the 3.125% Notes on or after October 15, 2026, we will not be required to pay a make-whole premium.

The notes rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries. Each applicable supplemental indenture for the notes contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and our (together with our subsidiaries’) ability to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that we, and our subsidiaries, may incur certain liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness if the aggregate amount of such liens does not exceed 3.5x Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture.Redemption of 7.25% Senior Notes.

Upon completion of this redemption, none of the 7.25% Notes remained outstanding.Bank Facilities In November 2016, we entered into amendment agreements (the “Credit Facility Amendments”) with respect to the 2013 Credit Facility, the 2014 Credit Facility and the Term Loan, which, among other things, (i) extend the maturity dates by one year to June 28, 2020, January 31, 2022 and January 31, 2022, respectively, (ii) increase the maximum Revolving Loan Commitments, after giving effect to any Incremental Commitments (each as defined in the loan agreements for each of the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility) to $4.25 billion and $3.00 billion under the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility, respectively, (iii) amend the limitation on indebtedness of, and guaranteed by, our subsidiaries to the greater of (x) $2.25 billion and (y) 50% of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreements for each of the 2013 Credit Facility, the 2014 Credit Facility and the Term Loan) of us and our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis and (iv) amend the limitation of our permitted ratio of Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (each as defined in the agreements for each of the 2013 Credit Facility, the 2014 Credit Facility and the Term Loan) to be no greater than (x) 6.00 to 1.00 as of the end of each fiscal quarter or (y) 7.00 to 43Table of Contents1.00 as of the specified time periods after the occurrence of a Qualified Acquisition (as defined in each of the Credit Facility Amendments).2013 Credit Facility. We have the ability to borrow up to $2.75 billion under the 2013 Credit Facility, which includes a $1.0 billion sublimit for multicurrency borrowings, a $200.0 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $50.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we borrowed an aggregate of $1.9 billion, which included borrowings of 38.0 million Euro ($42.9 million at the date of borrowing) by one of our Germany subsidiaries, and repaid an aggregate of $2.6 billion of revolving indebtedness. We primarily used the borrowings to fund the Viom Acquisition and for general corporate purposes. We currently have $3.2 million of undrawn letters of credit and maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the 2013 Credit Facility in the ordinary course. 2014 Credit Facility. We have the ability to borrow up to $2.0 billion under the 2014 Credit Facility, which includes a $200.0 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $50.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we borrowed an aggregate of $245.0 million and repaid an aggregate of $840.0 million of revolving indebtedness. We currently have $7.3 million of undrawn letters of credit and maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the 2014 Credit Facility in the ordinary course. Term Loan. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we repaid $1.0 billion of indebtedness under the Term Loan.The Term Loan, the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility do not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. We have the option of choosing either a defined base rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) as the applicable base rate for borrowings under the Term Loan, the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility. The interest rates range between 1.000% to 2.000% above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or up to 1.000% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based upon our debt ratings. The current margin over LIBOR and the base rate for each of the Term Loan, the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility is 1.250% and 0.250%, respectively. The 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility are subject to two optional renewal periods. We must pay a quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility, which ranges from 0.100% to 0.400% per annum, based upon our debt ratings, and is currently 0.150%.The loan agreements for each of the Term Loan, the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility contain certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply. Failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreements could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facilities, but may constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable.India indebtedness. Amounts outstanding and key terms of the India indebtedness consisted of the following as of December 31, 2016 (in millions, except percentages): Amount Outstanding (INR) Amount Outstanding (USD) Interest Rate (Range) Maturity Date (Range)Term loans 31,326 $461.2 8.15% - 11.15% March 31, 2017 - November 30, 2024Debenture 6,000 $88.3 9.90% April 28, 2020Working capital facilities 0 $0 8.70% - 11.70% January 31, 2017 - October 23, 2017The India indebtedness includes several term loans, ranging from one to ten years, which are generally secured by the borrower’s short-term and long-term assets. Each of the term loans bear interest at the applicable bank’s Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (as defined in the applicable agreement) or base rate, plus a spread. Interest rates on the term loans are fixed until certain reset dates. Generally, the term loans can be repaid without penalty on the reset dates; repayments at dates other than the reset dates are subject to prepayment penalties, typically of 1% to 2%. Scheduled repayment terms include either ratable or staggered amortization with repayments typically commencing between six and 36 months after the initial disbursement of funds. 44Table of ContentsThe debenture is secured by the borrower’s long-term assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets. The debenture bears interest at a base rate plus a spread of 0.6%. The base rate is set in advance for each quarterly coupon period. Should the actual base rate be between 9.75% and 10.25%, the revised base rate is assumed to be 10.00% for purposes of the reset. Additionally, the spread is subject to reset 36 and 48 months from the issuance date of April 27, 2015. The holders of the debenture must reach a consensus on the revised spread and the borrower must redeem all of the debentures held by holders from whom consensus is not achieved. Additionally, the debenture is required to be redeemed by the borrower if it does not maintain a minimum credit rating. The India indebtedness includes several working capital facilities, most of which are subject to annual renewal, and which are generally secured by the borrower’s short-term and long-term assets. The working capital facilities bear interest at rates that are comprised of the applicable bank’s Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (as defined in the applicable agreement) or base rate, plus a spread. Generally, the working capital facilities are payable on demand prior to maturity.Viom preference shares. As of December 31, 2016, ATC TIPL had 166,666,666 mandatorily redeemable preference shares (the “Preference Shares”) outstanding, which are required to be redeemed in cash.

ATC TIPL, at its option, may redeem the Preference Shares prior to the aforementioned dates, subject to an additional 2% redemption premium.Stock Repurchase Program. In March 2011, our Board of Directors approved a $1.5 billion stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to purchase up to an additional $1.1 billion of our common stock. Since September 2013, we have temporarily suspended repurchases under the program. However, we may, at any time, elect to resume repurchases under the program.Sales of Equity Securities. We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plans. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we received an aggregate of $92.5 million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and from the ESPP.Distributions. As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we have distributed, and expect to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income after taking into consideration our utilization of NOLs. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.We have two series of preferred stock outstanding, the Series A Preferred Stock, with a dividend rate of 5.25%, and the Series B Preferred Stock, with a dividend rate of 5.50%. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears, subject to declaration by our Board of Directors.

(14)Excludes $54.0 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and $20.8 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled. Settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe. However, based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements, we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Our liquidity depends upon our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities, borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness. We believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants, our compliance with which would be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity. Internally Generated Funds. Because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2016 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities depends upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites.Restrictions Under Loan Agreements Relating to Our Credit Facilities. The loan agreements for the 2014 Credit Facility, the 2013 Credit Facility and the Term Loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These restrictions include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage, as set forth in the table below. In the event that our debt ratings fall below investment grade, we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense (each as defined in the applicable loan agreement) of at least 2.50:1.00. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with each of these covenants.47Table of Contents Compliance Tests For 12 Months Ended December 31, 2016 ($ in billions) Ratio (1) Additional Debt Capacity Under Covenants (2) Capacity for Adjusted EBITDA Decrease Under Covenants (3)Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 6.00:1.00 ~ $3.8 ~ $0.6Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio Senior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 3.00:1.00 ~ $7.1 (4) ~ $2.4 (4)_______________(1) Each component of the ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement.(2) Assumes no change to Adjusted EBITDA.(3) Assumes no change to our debt levels. (4) Effectively, however, the capacity under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio.The loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants.Failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but may constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants.Restrictions Under Agreements Relating to the 2015 Securitization and the 2013 Securitization. The indenture and related supplemental indentures governing the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1, Class A (the “Series 2015-1 Notes”) and the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the “Series 2015-2 Notes,” and, together with the Series 2015-1 Notes, the “2015 Notes”) issued by GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC (“GTP Acquisition Partners”) in the 2015 Securitization and the loan agreement related to the 2013 Securitization include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the “AMT Asset Subs”) and GTP Acquisition Partners are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets, subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the applicable agreement). Under the agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the 2015 Notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan that secures the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-1A and Series 2013-2A issued in the 2013 Securitization (the “Loan”), as applicable, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement, subject to the conditions described in the table below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs, as applicable, and can then be distributed to, and used by, us. As of December 31, 2016, $99.5 million held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash. Certain information with respect to the 2015 Securitization and the 2013 Securitization is set forth below ($ in millions). The debt service coverage ratio (“DSCR”) is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination. 48Table of Contents Issuer or BorrowerNotes/Securities IssuedConditions Limiting Distributions of Excess CashExcess Cash Distributed During Year Ended December 31, 2016DSCR as of December 31, 2016Capacity for Decrease in Net Cash Flow Before Triggering Cash Trap DSCR (1)Capacity for Decrease in Net Cash Flow Before Triggering Minimum DSCR (1)Cash Trap DSCRAmortization Period2015 SecuritizationGTP Acquisition PartnersAmerican Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1 and Series 2015-21.30x, Tested Quarterly (2)(3)(4)$182.38.12x$182.2$186.22013 SecuritizationAMT Asset SubsSecured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-1A and Series 2013-2A1.30x, Tested Quarterly (2)(3)(5)$564.011.69x$499.5$506.7_______________(1)Based on the net cash flow of the applicable issuer or borrower as of December 31, 2016 and the expenses payable over the next 12 months on the 2015 Notes or the Loan, as applicable. (2)Once triggered, a Cash Trap DSCR condition continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. During a Cash Trap DSCR condition, all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account (the “Cash Trap Reserve Account”) instead of being released to the applicable issuer or borrower. (3)An amortization period commences if the DSCR is equal to or below 1.15x (the “Minimum DSCR”) at the end of any calendar quarter and continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. (4)No amortization period is triggered if the outstanding principal amount of a series has not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date. However, in such event, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the applicable series, and such series will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow.(5)An amortization period exists if the outstanding principal amount has not been paid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date and continues to exist until such principal has been repaid in full. A failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions, meet REIT distribution requirements and make preferred stock dividend payments. During an “amortization period”, all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the applicable Cash Trap Reserve Account would be applied to pay principal of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, on each monthly payment date, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Further, additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any series of the 2015 Notes or subclass of Loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement. With respect to the 2015 Notes, upon the occurrence and during an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of the 2015 Notes, declare such series of 2015 Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes. Furthermore, if GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs were to default on a series of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 2015 Secured Sites or the 2013 Secured Towers, respectively, in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assets.As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our distribution requirements and repay or repurchase our debt. If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital for these purposes, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and debt service obligations, pay preferred stock dividends or refinance our existing indebtedness.In addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and, consequently, a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity.49Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2016. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.•Impairment of Assets—Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization: We review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable. We review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements.We review our tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenant-related intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment.•Impairment of Assets—Goodwill: We review goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.Goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. We utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment and we employ a discounted cash flow analysis. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. Under the first step of this test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, we conduct the second step of this test, in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess.During the year ended December 31, 2016, no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test. The fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount. •Asset Retirement Obligations: When required, we recognize the fair value of obligations to remove our tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of our tower assets are located. Generally, the associated retirement 50Table of Contentscosts are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. We updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net decrease in the estimated obligation of $14.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in 2016 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary.•Acquisitions: For those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, we apply the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with our results from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We continue to evaluate acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future tenant cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition. •Revenue Recognition: Our revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is reasonably assured. Escalation clauses tied to the Consumer Price Index or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total property straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $131.7 million, $155.0 million and $123.7 million, respectively. Amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases. Amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met.We derive the largest portion of our revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, and 56% of our revenues are derived from four tenants in the industry. In addition, we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. We mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our borrowers and tenants. In recognizing tenant revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense. Accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured.•Rent Expense: Many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time. In addition, certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. We calculate straight-line ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. 51Table of Contents•Stock-Based Compensation: The fair value of a stock option is determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that takes into account a number of assumptions at the accounting measurement date including the stock price, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock, the expected distributions, and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. These assumptions are highly subjective and could significantly impact the value of the option and the compensation expense. In addition, the amount we record as stock-based compensation expense is impacted by forfeitures, which are accounted for as they occur. The fair value of both time-based and performance-based restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. We also make certain assumptions regarding performance relative to grant parameters applicable to performance-based restricted stock units, which could significantly impact the compensation expense. We recognize stock-based compensation in either selling, general, administrative and development expense, costs of operations or as part of the costs associated with the construction of our tower assets.•Income Taxes: Accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes. To the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes, deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns, which may differ from the current rate. We do not expect to pay federal taxes on our REIT taxable income.We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes, if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability.We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination, which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit.We consider the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. Should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, we may have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside of the United States.Accounting Standards UpdateFor a discussion of recent accounting standards updates, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.52Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe following table provides information as of December 31, 2016 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates.

(g) Represents the weighted average variable rate of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts.Interest Rate RiskAs of December 31, 2016, we have one interest rate swap agreement related to debt in Colombia. This swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge, has a notional amount of $28.3 million and an interest rate of 5.74% and expires in April 2021. We also have three interest rate swap agreements related to the 2.250% Notes. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of $600.0 million and an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expire in January 2022. Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2016 consisted of $1,385.0 million under the 2014 Credit Facility, $540.0 million under the 2013 Credit Facility, $1,000.0 million under the Term Loan, $600.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 2.250% Notes, $84.7 million under the South African credit facility, $28.3 million under the Colombian credit facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements, $101.0 million under the BR Towers debentures and $45.3 million under the Brazil credit facility. A 10% increase in current interest rates would result in an additional $10.0 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016. Foreign Currency RiskWe are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar is reported 53Table of Contentsin U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 40% of our revenues and 45% of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies.As of December 31, 2016, we have incurred intercompany debt that is not considered to be permanently reinvested, and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As this debt had not been designated as being a long-term investment in nature, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. An adverse change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in $38.0 million of unrealized losses that would be included in Other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.",2023-12-30 19:23:39.121054
1053507,AMT,AMERICAN TOWER CORP /MA/,2018,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the accompanying notes, and the information set forth under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” below.We report our results in five segments: U.S. property, Asia property, EMEA property, Latin America property and Services. In evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses, among other factors, segment gross margin and segment operating profit (see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Executive OverviewWe are one of the largest global REITs and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure and property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. We refer to this business as our property operations, which accounted for 99% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 and includes our U.S. property segment, Asia property segment, EMEA property segment and Latin America property segment.We also offer tower-related services in the United States, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting and structural analysis, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. 27Table of ContentsThe following table details the number of communications sites, excluding managed sites, that we owned or operated as of December 31, 2017: Number ofOwned Towers Number ofOperated Towers (1) Number ofOwned DAS SitesDomestic: United States 24,231 16,009 378Asia: India 57,681 — 353EMEA: France 2,168 307 9Germany 2,208 — —Ghana 2,178 — 23Nigeria 4,757 — —South Africa (2) 2,530 — —Uganda 1,431 — —EMEA total 15,272 307 32Latin America: Argentina (3) 7 — 1Brazil 16,551 2,257 81Chile 1,295 — 9Colombia 3,706 777 1Costa Rica 492 — 2Mexico (4) 8,862 199 78Paraguay 836 — —Peru 637 127 —Latin America total 32,386 3,360 172_______________(1)Approximately 98% of the operated towers are held pursuant to long-term capital leases, including those subject to purchase options.(2)In South Africa, we also own fiber.(3)In Argentina, we also own or operate urban telecommunications assets, fiber and the rights to utilize certain existing utility infrastructure for future telecommunications equipment installation. (4)In Mexico, we also own or operate urban telecommunications assets, including fiber, concrete poles and other infrastructure. In most of our markets, our tenant leases with wireless carriers have an initial non-cancellable term of at least ten years, with multiple renewal terms. Accordingly, the vast majority of the revenue generated by our property operations during the year ended December 31, 2017 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2017, we expect to generate over $32 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting. Most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically based on an annual fixed escalation (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in our international markets, or a combination of both. In addition, certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs. The revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts, which typically are non-cancellable; however, in some instances, a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee.Revenue lost from either cancellations or the non-renewal of leases or rent renegotiations historically has not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our property operations. This was again the case during the year ended December 31, 2017, in which loss of tenant billings from tenant lease cancellations, non-renewal or renegotiations represented approximately 2% of our tenant billings. We do anticipate an increase in revenue lost from cancellations or non-renewals in 2018 primarily due to carrier consolidation-driven churn in Asia, which is likely to result in a modestly higher impact on our revenues, including tenant billings, as compared to the historical average.28Table of ContentsProperty Operations Revenue Growth. Due to our diversified communications site portfolio, our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. We measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. In many instances, tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation expenditures.The primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our property segments are:•Growth in tenant billings, including:•New revenue attributable to leases in place on day one on sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior-year period;•New revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our sites (“colocations”) and lease amendments; and•Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of churn. •Revenue growth from other items, including additional tenant payments primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs included in certain tenant leases (“pass-through”), straight-line revenue and decommissioning.We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services globally and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our communications real estate. By adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, we are able to increase these sites’ utilization and profitability. We believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers, with tenants in a number of other industries contributing incremental leasing demand. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks, while also deploying next generation wireless technologies. In addition, we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk-adjusted return on investment objectives. Property Operations Organic Revenue Growth. Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment from our sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers and other tenants deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless services, the penetration of advanced wireless devices, the level of emphasis on network quality and capacity in carrier competition, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions.Based on industry research and projections, we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us:•In less advanced wireless markets where initial voice and data networks are still being deployed, we expect these deployments to drive demand for our tower space as carriers seek to expand their footprints and increase the scope and density of their networks. We have established operations in many of these markets at the early stages of wireless development, which we believe will enable us to meaningfully participate in these deployments over the long term.•Subscribers’ use of mobile data continues to grow rapidly given increasing smartphone and other advanced device penetration, the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications on these devices and the continuing evolution of the mobile ecosystem. We believe carriers will be compelled to deploy additional equipment on existing networks while also rolling out more advanced wireless networks to address coverage and capacity needs resulting from this increasing mobile data usage.•The deployment of advanced mobile technology across existing wireless networks will provide higher speed data services and further enable fixed broadband substitution. As a result, we expect that our tenants will continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks.•Wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their existing networks, which is driven by capacity and coverage. To maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases, our tenants continue deploying additional equipment across their existing sites while also adding new cell sites. We anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years, as existing network infrastructure is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage. 29Table of Contents•Wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum, and as a result are expected to add additional sites and equipment to their networks as they seek to optimize their network configuration and utilize additional spectrum.•Next generation technologies centered on wireless connections have the potential to provide incremental revenue opportunities for us. These technologies may include autonomous vehicle networks and a number of other internet-of-things, or IoT, applications, as well as other potential use cases for wireless services.As part of our international expansion initiatives, we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term. In addition, we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers such as Bharti Airtel Limited, Telefónica S.A. and Vodafone Group PLC, among others. We believe that consistent carrier network investments across our international markets position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward.In emerging markets, such as Ghana, India, Nigeria and Uganda, wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the United States, and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in underdeveloped areas. A majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services, predominantly on feature phones, while advanced device penetration remains low. In more developed urban locations within these markets, data network deployments are underway. Carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while also investing in initial data networks as mobile data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate. In India, the ongoing transition from 2G technology to 4G technology has included and is expected to continue to include a period of carrier consolidation over the next several years, whereby the number of carriers operating in the marketplace will be reduced through mergers, acquisitions and select carrier exits from the marketplace. Over the long term, this consolidation process is expected to result in a more favorable structural environment for both the wireless carriers as well as communications infrastructure providers. In the shorter term, the consolidation process has resulted and is likely to further result in elevated levels of churn within our India business, as certain components of the combined carrier networks and carrier exits are decommissioned to allow for a more robust 4G deployment in the future.In markets with rapidly evolving network technology, such as South Africa and most of the countries in Latin America where we do business, initial voice networks, for the most part, have already been built out, and carriers are focused on 3G and 4G network build outs. Consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices, and, as a result, the usage of bandwidth-intensive mobile applications is growing materially. Recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks. Smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are advancing rapidly, which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks to maintain and augment their quality of service.Finally, in markets with more mature network technology, such as Germany and France, carriers are focused on deploying 4G data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their customer base. With higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage, carrier investment in networks is focused on 4G coverage and capacity.We believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the United States, which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years, will ultimately be replicated in our less advanced international markets. As a result, we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 109,565 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier tenants to drive sustainable, long-term growth.We have master lease agreements with certain of our tenants that provide for consistent, long-term revenue and reduce the likelihood of churn. Certain of those master lease agreements are holistic in nature and further build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced colocation cycle times, thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites.Property Operations New Site Revenue Growth. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 6,885 sites globally, as well as the acquisition of certain urban telecommunications assets in Mexico. In a majority of our Asia, EMEA and Latin America markets, the revenue generated from newly acquired or constructed sites resulted in increases in both tenant and pass-through revenues (such as ground rent or power and fuel costs) and expenses. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications 30Table of Contentsreal estate portfolios, both domestically and internationally, to determine whether they meet our risk-adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio. New Sites (Acquired or Constructed)2017 2016 2015U.S.635 65 11,595Asia1,135 43,865 2,330EMEA2,755 665 4,910Latin America2,360 715 6,535Property Operations Expenses. Direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes, repairs and maintenance. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled Selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our property segments’ selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our sites and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new tenants on our sites provides significant incremental cash flow. We may, however, incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our sites but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities.Services Segment Revenue Growth. As we continue to focus on growing our property operations, we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIncluded in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (“Adjusted EBITDA”), Funds From Operations, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit FFO”) attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations (“Consolidated AFFO”) and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders.We define Adjusted EBITDA as Net income before Income (loss) from equity method investments; Income tax benefit (provision); Other income (expense); Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; Interest expense; Interest income; Other operating income (expense); Depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense. Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interests. In this section, we refer to Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “Nareit FFO (common stockholders).” We define Consolidated AFFO as Nareit FFO (common stockholders) before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) the deferred portion of income tax; (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion; (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges; (vi) other income (expense); (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; (viii) other operating income (expense); and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interests, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures. We define AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2017 as Consolidated AFFO, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both Nareit FFO (common stockholders) and the other adjustments included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. In this section, we refer to AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “AFFO (common stockholders).” Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. None of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO or AFFO (common stockholders) represents cash flows 31Table of Contentsfrom operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or a measure of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for decision making purposes and for evaluating our operating segments’ performance; (2) Adjusted EBITDA is a component underlying our credit ratings; (3) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4) Consolidated AFFO is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to adjust Nareit FFO (common stockholders) for items that may otherwise cause material fluctuations in Nareit FFO (common stockholders) growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of property assets in those periods; (5) each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (6) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies, particularly those in our industry. Our measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included below.32Table of ContentsResults of OperationsYears Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in millions, except percentages)We have converted our disclosure from thousands to millions and, as a result, any necessary rounding adjustments have been made to prior year disclosed amounts.

Consequently, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 differs from the federal statutory rate.The decrease in the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to lower uncertain tax position reserve recorded in 2017 than in 2016, a decrease in foreign earnings in India due to impairments, as well as changes in tax laws in certain foreign jurisdictions.The decrease in the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to a tax election filed in 2015, pursuant to which MIPT no longer operates as a separate REIT for federal and state income tax purposes. In connection with this and related elections, we incurred a one-time cash tax charge of $93.0 million and a one-time deferred income tax benefit of $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Additionally, we use our cash flows to make distributions, including distributions of our REIT taxable income to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We may also repay or repurchase our existing indebtedness or equity from time to time. We typically fund our international expansion efforts primarily through a combination of cash on hand, intercompany debt and equity contributions.As of December 31, 2017, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $20.3 billion, with a current portion of $775.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital 42Table of Contentsexpenditures and debt service obligations, as well as our required distributions. We believe the cash generated by operating activities during the year ending December 31, 2018, together with our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our required distributions, capital expenditures, debt service obligations (interest and principal repayments) and signed acquisitions. As of December 31, 2017, we had $632.8 million of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $289.9 million was held by our joint ventures. While certain subsidiaries may pay us interest or principal on intercompany debt, it has not been our practice to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs.

We entered into interest rate swaps, which were designated as fair value hedges at inception, to hedge against changes in fair value of $500.0 million of the $700.0 million under the 3.000% Notes resulting from changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2017, the interest rate on the 3.000% Notes, after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements, was 2.49%. We may redeem each series of senior notes at any time, subject to the terms of the applicable supplemental indenture, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date. If we redeem the 1.375% Notes on or after January 4, 2025, the 3.55% Notes on or after April 15, 2027 or the 3.600% Notes on or after October 15, 2027, we will not be required to pay a make-whole premium. In addition, if we undergo a change of control and corresponding ratings decline, each as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture, we may be required to repurchase all of the applicable notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if any), up to but not including the repurchase date. The notes rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries. Each applicable supplemental indenture for the notes contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and our (together with our subsidiaries’) ability to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that we and our subsidiaries may incur certain liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness if the aggregate amount of such liens does not exceed 3.5x Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture.Redemption of 7.25% Senior Notes.

We have the ability to borrow up to $2.75 billion under the 2013 Credit Facility, which includes a $1.0 billion sublimit for multicurrency borrowings, a $200.0 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $50.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we borrowed an aggregate of $3.8 billion and repaid an aggregate of $2.3 billion of revolving indebtedness. We primarily used the borrowings to fund acquisitions, repay existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. We currently have $4.0 million of undrawn letters of credit and maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the 2013 Credit Facility in the ordinary course. 2014 Credit Facility. We have the ability to borrow up to $2.0 billion under the 2014 Credit Facility, which includes a $200.0 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $50.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we borrowed an aggregate of $815.0 million and repaid an aggregate of $1.7 billion of revolving indebtedness. We primarily used the borrowings to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. We currently have $6.3 million of undrawn letters of credit and maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the 2014 Credit Facility in the ordinary course. The Term Loan, the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility do not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. We have the option of choosing either a defined base rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) as the applicable base rate for borrowings under the Term Loan, the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility. The interest rate on the 2013 Credit Facility ranges between 0.875% to 1.750% above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or up to 0.750% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based upon our debt ratings. The current margin over LIBOR and the base rate for the 2013 Credit Facility is 1.125% and 0.125%, respectively. The interest rates on the Term Loan and the 2014 Credit Facility range between 1.000% to 2.000% above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or up to 1.000% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based upon our debt ratings. The current margin over LIBOR and the base rate for each of the Term Loan and the 2014 Credit Facility is 1.250% and 0.250%, respectively. The 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility are subject to two optional renewal periods and we must pay a quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of each facility. The commitment fee for the 2013 Credit Facility ranges from 0.100% to 0.350% per annum, based upon our debt ratings, and is currently 0.1250%. The commitment fee for the 2014 Credit Facility ranges from 0.100% to 0.400% per annum, based upon our debt ratings, and is currently 0.150%. The loan agreements for each of the Term Loan, the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility contain certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply. Failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreements could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facilities, but may constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable.India indebtedness. Amounts outstanding and key terms of the India indebtedness consisted of the following as of December 31, 2017 (in millions, except percentages): Amount Outstanding (INR) Amount Outstanding (USD) Interest Rate (Range) Maturity Date (Range)Term loans 26,740 $418.7 7.90% - 8.65% January 24, 2018 - November 30, 2024Debenture 6,000 $93.9 9.55% April 28, 2020Working capital facilities 0 $0 8.05% - 8.75% March 18, 2018 - October 23, 2018The India indebtedness includes several term loans, ranging from one to ten years, which are generally secured by the borrower’s short-term and long-term assets. Each of the term loans bear interest at the applicable bank’s Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (as defined in the applicable agreement) or base rate, plus a spread. Interest rates on the term loans are fixed until certain reset dates. Generally, the term loans can be repaid without penalty on the reset dates; repayments at dates other than the reset dates are subject to prepayment penalties, typically of 1% to 2%. Scheduled repayment terms include either 46Table of Contentsratable or staggered amortization with repayments typically commencing between six and 36 months after the initial disbursement of funds.The debenture is secured by the borrower’s long-term assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets. The debenture bears interest at a base rate plus a spread of 0.6%. The base rate is set in advance for each quarterly coupon period. Should the actual base rate be between 9.75% and 10.25%, the revised base rate is assumed to be 10.00% for purposes of the reset. Additionally, the spread is subject to reset 36 and 48 months from the issuance date of April 27, 2015. The holders of the debenture must reach a consensus on the revised spread and the borrower must redeem all of the debentures held by holders from whom consensus is not achieved. Additionally, the debenture is required to be redeemed by the borrower if it does not maintain a minimum credit rating. The India indebtedness includes several working capital facilities, most of which are subject to annual renewal, and which are generally secured by the borrower’s short-term and long-term assets. The working capital facilities bear interest at rates that are comprised of the applicable bank’s Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (as defined in the applicable agreement) or base rate, plus a spread. Generally, the working capital facilities are payable on demand prior to maturity.India preference shares. On March 2, 2017, ATC TIPL issued 166,666,666 mandatorily redeemable preference shares (the “Preference Shares”) and used the proceeds to redeem the preference shares previously issued by Viom (the “Viom Preference Shares”).

As of December 31, 2017, ATC TIPL had 166,666,666 mandatorily redeemable preference shares (the “Preference Shares”) outstanding, which are required to be redeemed in cash. Accordingly, we recognized debt of 1.67 billion INR ($26.1 million) related to the Preference Shares. Stock Repurchase Programs. We have two stock repurchase programs, the 2011 Buyback and the 2017 Buyback.During the year ended December 31, 2017, we resumed the 2011 Buyback and repurchased 6,099,150 shares of our common stock thereunder for an aggregate of $766.3 million, including commissions and fees. We had no repurchases under the 2017 Buyback.Under each program, we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions not to exceed market prices, and (with respect to such open market purchases) pursuant to plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. We expect to continue managing the pacing of the remaining $344.8 million under the 2011 Buyback and the $2.0 billion authorized under the 2017 Buyback in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors. We expect to fund further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Purchases under the 2011 Buyback and the 2017 Buyback are subject to us having available cash to fund repurchases. Sales of Equity Securities. We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plans. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we received an aggregate of $119.7 million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and sales pursuant to the ESPP.Distributions. As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we have distributed, and expect to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income after taking into consideration our utilization of NOLs. We have distributed an aggregate of approximately $4.3 billion to our common stockholders, including the dividend paid in January 2018, primarily classified as ordinary income.The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.We had two series of preferred stock, the Series A Preferred Stock, with a dividend rate of 5.25%, and the Series B Preferred Stock, with a dividend rate of 5.50%. Dividends were payable quarterly in arrears, subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid dividends of $2.625 per share, or $15.8 million, to Series A 47Table of Contentspreferred stockholders of record and $55.00 per share, or $75.6 million, to Series B preferred stockholders of record.

As a result of the conversions of the Series B Preferred Stock in 2018, we issued an aggregate of 12,020,064 shares of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid $2.50 per share, or $1.1 billion, to common stockholders of record. In addition, we declared a distribution of $0.70 per share, or $300.2 million, paid on January 16, 2018 to our common stockholders of record at the close of business on December 28, 2017.We accrue distributions on unvested restricted stock units, which are payable upon vesting.

(11)Excludes $94.8 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and $29.0 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled. Settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe. However, based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements, we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities, borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness. We believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants, our compliance with which would be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity. Internally Generated Funds. Because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2017 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities depends upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites.Restrictions Under Loan Agreements Relating to Our Credit Facilities. The loan agreements for the 2013 Credit Facility, the 2014 Credit Facility and the Term Loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These restrictions include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage, as set forth in the table below. In the event that our debt ratings fall below investment grade, we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense (each as defined in the applicable loan agreement) of at least 2.50:1.00. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. Compliance Tests For 12 Months Ended December 31, 2017 ($ in billions) Ratio (1) Additional Debt Capacity Under Covenants (2) Capacity for Adjusted EBITDA Decrease Under Covenants (3)Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 6.00:1.00 ~ $5.0 ~ $0.8Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio Senior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 3.00:1.00 ~ $9.0 (4) ~ $3.0 (4)_______________(1) Each component of the ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement.(2) Assumes no change to Adjusted EBITDA.(3) Assumes no change to our debt levels. (4) Effectively, however, additional Senior Secured Debt under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio.The loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants.50Table of ContentsFailure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but may constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants.Restrictions Under Agreements Relating to the 2015 Securitization and the 2013 Securitization. The indenture and related supplemental indentures governing the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1, Class A (the “Series 2015-1 Notes”) and the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the “Series 2015-2 Notes,” and, together with the Series 2015-1 Notes, the “2015 Notes”) issued by GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC (“GTP Acquisition Partners”) in the 2015 Securitization and the loan agreement related to the 2013 Securitization include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the “AMT Asset Subs”) and GTP Acquisition Partners are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets, subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the applicable agreement). Under the agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the 2015 Notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan that secures the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-1A and Series 2013-2A issued in the 2013 Securitization (the “Loan”), as applicable, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement, subject to the conditions described in the table below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs, as applicable, which can then be distributed to, and used by, us. As of December 31, 2017, $107.3 million held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash. Certain information with respect to the 2015 Securitization and the 2013 Securitization is set forth below. The debt service coverage ratio (“DSCR”) is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination.

During a Cash Trap DSCR condition, all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account (the “Cash Trap Reserve Account”) instead of being released to the applicable issuer or borrower. (3)An amortization period commences if the DSCR is equal to or below 1.15x (the “Minimum DSCR”) at the end of any calendar quarter and continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. (4)No amortization period is triggered if the outstanding principal amount of a series has not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date. However, in such event, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the applicable series, and such series will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow.(5)An amortization period exists if the outstanding principal amount has not been paid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date and continues to exist until such principal has been repaid in full. A failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions, meet REIT distribution requirements and make preferred stock dividend payments. During an “amortization period,” all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the applicable Cash Trap Reserve Account would be applied to pay principal of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, on each monthly payment date, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Further, additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any series of the 2015 Notes or subclass of Loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement. With respect to the 2015 Notes, upon the occurrence and during an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of the 2015 Notes, declare such series of 2015 Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes. Furthermore, if GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs were to default on a series of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 2015 Secured Sites or the 2013 Secured Towers, respectively, in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assets.As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our distribution requirements and repay or repurchase our debt. If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and debt service obligations, pay preferred stock dividends or refinance our existing indebtedness.In addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and, consequently, a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2017. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.•Impairment of Assets—Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization: We review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable. 52Table of ContentsWe review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements.We review our tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenant-related intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment.In October 2017, one of our tenants in Asia, Tata Teleservices, informed the Department of Telecommunications in India of its intent to exit the wireless telecommunications business and announced plans to transfer its business to another telecommunications provider. We considered these recent developments regarding these events when conducting our annual impairment test for the Tata Teleservices tenant relationship, which did not result in an impairment since the estimated probability-weighted undiscounted cash flows were in excess of the carrying value of this asset by approximately $33.5 million, or 7%.Key assumptions included in the undiscounted cash flows were future revenue projections, estimates of ongoing tenancies, operating margins and the probability weightings assigned to the future cash flow scenarios. For this tenant relationship intangible asset, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that a 7% reduction on projected cash flows, which we determined to be reasonable, would impact our conclusion that the undiscounted future cash flows to be generated from the tenant relationship exceeds its carrying value.We will continue to monitor the status of these developments, as it is possible that the estimated future cash flows may differ from current estimates and changes in estimated cash flows from Tata Teleservices could have an impact on previously recorded tangible and intangible assets, including amounts originally recorded as tenant-related intangibles, which have a current net book value of $436.4 million. •Impairment of Assets—Goodwill: We review goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.Goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. We utilize the two step impairment test and employ a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. Under the first step of this test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, we conduct the second step of this test, in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess.During the year ended December 31, 2017, no potential impairment was identified as the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount. The fair value of our India reporting unit, which is based on the present value of forecasted future value cash flows (the income approach) exceeded the carrying value by approximately $99.1 million, or 3%. As a result of the telecommunications carrier consolidation occurring in the India market, we lowered our discounted cash flow projections, which increases the sensitivity of these projections to changes in the key assumptions used in determining the fair value of the India reporting unit as of December 31, 2017. Key assumptions include future revenue growth rates and operating margins, capital expenditures, terminal period growth rate and the weighted-average cost of capital, which were determined considering historical data and current assumptions related to the impacts of the carrier consolidation. 53Table of ContentsFor this reporting unit, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that (i) a 6% reduction on projected revenues, (ii) a 21 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of capital or (iii) a 10% reduction in terminal sales growth rate, individually, each of which we determined to be reasonable, would impact our conclusion that the fair value of the India reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. Events that could negatively affect our India reporting units financial results include increased customer attrition exceeding our forecast resulting from the ongoing carrier consolidation, carrier tenant bankruptcies, and other factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors.”The carrying value of goodwill in the India reporting unit was $1,095.0 million as of December 31, 2017, which represents 19% of our consolidated balance of $5,638.4 million.•Asset Retirement Obligations: When required, we recognize the fair value of obligations to remove our tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of our tower assets are located. Generally, the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. We updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of $68.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The change in 2017 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary.•Acquisitions: We evaluate each of our acquisitions under the accounting guidance framework to determine whether to treat an acquisition as an asset acquisition or a business combination. For those transactions treated as asset acquisitions, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired, with no recognition of goodwill. For those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, we apply the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with our results from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We continue to evaluate acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future tenant cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition. •Revenue Recognition: Our revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is reasonably assured. Escalation clauses tied to the Consumer Price Index or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total property straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $194.4 million, $131.7 million and $155.0 million, respectively. Amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases. Amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met.We derive the largest portion of our revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, with 53% of our revenues derived from four tenants. In addition, we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. We mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our borrowers and 54Table of Contentstenants. In recognizing tenant revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense. Accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured.•Rent Expense: Many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time. In addition, certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. We calculate straight-line ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. •Income Taxes: Accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes. To the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes, deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns, which may differ from the current rate. We do not expect to pay federal taxes on our REIT taxable income.We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes, if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability.We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination, which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit.The Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The Tax Act contains several key provisions including, among other things, a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation of all post-1986 untaxed foreign earnings and profits, a reduction in the corporate income rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and the introduction of a new U.S. tax on certain off-shore earnings referred to as Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”).The SEC staff issued guidance to address the application of GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act and allows the registrant to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date. We have recognized the provisional impacts of the Tax Act in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. We estimated these amounts to not be material, however, our estimates are provisional and subject to further analysis.The Financial Accounting Standards Board also provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of GILTI, noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred. We have not completed our analysis of the effects of the GILTI provisions and will further consider the accounting policy election within the permitted measurement period.Accounting Standards UpdateFor a discussion of recent accounting standards updates, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.55Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe following table provides information as of December 31, 2017 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates.

(g) Represents the weighted average variable rate of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts.Interest Rate RiskAs of December 31, 2017, we have one interest rate swap agreement related to debt in Colombia. This swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge, has a notional amount of $23.5 million and an interest rate of 5.74% and expires in April 2021. We have three interest rate swap agreements related to the 2.250% Notes. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of $600.0 million and an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expire in January 2022. In addition, we have three interest rate swap agreements related to a portion of the 3.000% Notes. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of $500.0 million and an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expire in June 2023. Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2017 consisted of $495.0 million under the 2014 Credit Facility, $2,075.6 million under the 2013 Credit Facility, $1,000.0 million under the Term Loan, $600.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 2.250% Notes, $500.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 3.000% Notes, $70.5 million under the South African credit facility, $23.5 million under the Colombian credit facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements, $92.7 million under the BR Towers debentures and $37.6 million under the Brazil credit facility. A 10% increase in current interest rates would result in an additional $13.7 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. 56Table of ContentsForeign Currency RiskWe are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar is reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 44% of our revenues and 51% of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies.As of December 31, 2017, we have incurred intercompany debt that is not considered to be permanently reinvested, and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As this debt had not been designated as being a long-term investment in nature, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income.

The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the accompanying notes, and the information set forth under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” below. We report our results in five segments: U.S. property, Asia property, EMEA property, Latin America property and services. In evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses, among other factors, segment gross margin and segment operating profit (see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Executive OverviewWe are one of the largest global REITs and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. We refer to this business as our property operations, which accounted for 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 and includes our U.S. property segment, Asia property segment, EMEA property segment and Latin America property segment. We also offer tower-related services in the United States, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting and structural analysis, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. 23Table of ContentsThe following table details the number of communications sites, excluding managed sites, that we owned or operated as of December 31, 2018: Number ofOwned Towers Number ofOperated Towers (1) Number ofOwned DAS SitesDomestic: United States 24,454 15,905 398Asia: India 74,804 — 1,068EMEA: France 2,186 309 9Germany 2,208 — —Ghana 2,279 — 24Kenya 715 Nigeria 4,760 — —South Africa (2) 2,652 — —Uganda 1,523 — —EMEA total 16,323 309 33Latin America: Argentina (3) 36 — 4Brazil (3) 16,632 2,257 91Chile 1,298 — 18Colombia 4,943 — 2Costa Rica 553 — 2Mexico (4) 9,047 186 85Paraguay 1,276 — —Peru 690 272 —Latin America total 34,475 2,715 202_______________(1)Approximately 98% of the operated towers are held pursuant to long-term capital leases, including those subject to purchase options.(2)In South Africa, we also own fiber.(3)In Argentina and Brazil, we also own or operate urban telecommunications assets, fiber and the rights to utilize certain existing utility infrastructure for future telecommunications equipment installation. (4)In Mexico, we also own or operate urban telecommunications assets, including fiber, concrete poles and other infrastructure. In most of our markets, our tenant leases with wireless carriers generally have an initial non-cancellable term of at least ten years, with multiple renewal terms. Accordingly, the vast majority of the revenue generated by our property operations during the year ended December 31, 2018 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2018, we expect to generate nearly $35 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting. Most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically based on an annual fixed escalation (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in our international markets, or a combination of both. In addition, certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs. The revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts, which typically are non-cancellable; however, in some instances, a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee.Revenue lost from either cancellations or the non-renewal of leases or rent renegotiations, which we refer to as churn, historically has not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our consolidated property operations. This was again the case during the year ended December 31, 2018, in which loss of tenant billings from tenant lease cancellations, non-renewal or renegotiations represented approximately 4% of our tenant billings. 24Table of ContentsIn 2018, we experienced an increase in revenue lost from cancellations or non-renewals primarily due to carrier consolidation-driven churn in India, which we expect will continue to result in a higher impact on our revenues, including tenant billings, as compared to the historical average, in 2019. We also expect this churn will compress our gross margin and operating profit in 2019, particularly in our Asia property segment, although we expect this to be partially offset by lower expenses due to reduced tenancy on existing sites or the decommissioning of sites. In addition, we expect to periodically evaluate the carrying value of our Indian assets, which may result in the realization of additional impairment expense or other similar charges. For more information, please see the information under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.”In October 2018, we entered into agreements with one of our tenants in India, Tata Teleservices and related entities (collectively, “Tata”), for a settlement and release of certain contractual lease obligations of Tata. For the year ended December 31, 2018, carrier consolidation-driven churn in India, including churn associated with our settlement with Tata, negatively impacted our consolidated property revenue by $189.1 million, including approximately $61.0 million in pass-through revenue, and negatively impacted our gross margin and operating profit by $119.8 million. The effects of carrier consolidation-driven churn described above were offset by the impact of the settlement with Tata, which resulted in a net positive impact to property revenue of $333.7 million as a result of the $345.5 million cash payment, partially offset by the impact of straight-line accounting and other amounts directly related to the settlement. The settlement also resulted in a net positive impact to operating profit of $326.9 million. On a net basis, carrier consolidation-driven churn and our settlement with Tata positively impacted our full year 2018 consolidated property revenue by $144.6 million and our full year 2018 operating profit by $207.1 million. In 2019, we expect carrier consolidation-driven churn in India, excluding the impact of the nonrecurrence of one-time items related to the settlement with Tata in 2018, to negatively impact our consolidated property revenue by approximately $191.2 million, including approximately $22.3 million in pass-through revenue, and our operating profit by approximately $148.0 million. We also recorded impairment charges of $164.2 million as a result of the settlement with Tata in October 2018 and $147.4 million as a result of one of our tenants in India, Aircel Ltd.’s (“Aircel”), filing for bankruptcy protection in February 2018.Property Operations Revenue Growth. Due to our diversified communications site portfolio, our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. We measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. In many instances, tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation capital expenditures.The primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our property segments are:•Growth in tenant billings, including:•New revenue attributable to leases in place on day one on sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior-year period;•New revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our sites (“colocations”) and lease amendments; and•Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of churn. •Revenue growth from other items, including additional tenant payments primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs included in certain tenant leases (“pass-through”), straight-line revenue and decommissioning.We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services globally and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our communications real estate. By adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, we are able to increase these sites’ utilization and profitability. We believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers, with tenants in a number of other industries contributing incremental leasing demand. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks, while also deploying next generation wireless technologies. In addition, we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk-adjusted return on investment objectives. Property Operations Organic Revenue Growth. Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment from our sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers 25Table of Contentsand other tenants deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless services, the penetration of advanced wireless devices, the level of emphasis on network quality and capacity in carrier competition, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions. According to industry data, recent aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the United States has averaged approximately $30 billion, resulting in consistent demand for our sites. Based on industry research and projections, we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us:•In less advanced wireless markets where initial voice and data networks are still being deployed, we expect these deployments to drive demand for our tower space as carriers seek to expand their footprints and increase the scope and density of their networks. We have established operations in many of these markets at the early stages of wireless development, which we believe will enable us to meaningfully participate in these deployments over the long term.•Subscribers’ use of mobile data continues to grow rapidly given increasing smartphone and other advanced device penetration, the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications on these devices and the continuing evolution of the mobile ecosystem. We believe carriers will be compelled to deploy additional equipment on existing networks while also rolling out more advanced wireless networks to address coverage and capacity needs resulting from this increasing mobile data usage.•The deployment of advanced mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G, across existing wireless networks will provide higher speed data services and further enable fixed broadband substitution. As a result, we expect that our tenants will continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks.•Wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their existing networks, which is driven by capacity and coverage. To maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases, our tenants continue deploying additional equipment across their existing sites while also adding new cell sites. We anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years, as existing network infrastructure is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage. •Wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum, and as a result are expected to add additional sites and equipment to their networks as they seek to optimize their network configuration and utilize additional spectrum.•Next generation technologies requiring wireless connectivity have the potential to provide incremental revenue opportunities for us. These technologies may include autonomous vehicle networks and a number of other internet-of-things, or IoT, applications, as well as other potential use cases for wireless services. These technologies may create new and complementary use cases for our communications real estate over time, although these use cases are currently in nascent stages.As part of our international expansion initiatives, we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term. In addition, we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers such as Airtel, Telefónica S.A. and Vodafone Group PLC, among others. We believe that consistent carrier network investments across our international markets position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward.In emerging markets, such as Ghana, India, Kenya, Nigeria and Uganda, wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the United States, and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in certain underdeveloped areas. A majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services, predominantly on feature phones, while advanced device penetration remains low. In more developed urban locations within these markets, data network deployments are underway. Carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while also investing in initial data networks as mobile data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate. In India, the ongoing transition from 2G technology to 4G technology has included a period of carrier consolidation, which we expect to continue through 2019, whereby the number of carriers operating in the marketplace has been reduced through mergers, acquisitions and select carrier exits from the marketplace. Over the long term, this consolidation process is expected to result in a more favorable structural environment for both the wireless carriers as well as communications infrastructure providers. In the shorter term, as described above, the consolidation process continues to result in elevated levels of churn within our India business, as merging carriers rationalize redundant legacy equipment installations and as select carriers exit the marketplace.26Table of ContentsIn markets with rapidly evolving network technology, such as South Africa and most of the countries in Latin America where we do business, initial voice networks, for the most part, have already been built out, and carriers are focused on 3G and 4G network build outs. Consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices, in particular as lower cost smartphones become increasingly available. As a result, the usage of bandwidth-intensive mobile applications is growing materially. Recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks. Smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are advancing rapidly, which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks to maintain and augment their quality of service.Finally, in markets with more mature network technology, such as Germany and France, carriers are focused on deploying 4G data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their customer base. With higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage, carrier investment in networks is focused on 4G coverage and capacity.We believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the United States, which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years, will be replicated in our less advanced international markets over time. As a result, we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 129,930 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier tenants to drive sustainable, long-term growth.We have master lease agreements with certain of our tenants that provide for consistent, long-term revenue and reduce the likelihood of churn. Certain of those master lease agreements are holistic in nature and further build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced colocation cycle times, thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites.Demand for our communications sites could be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including an increase in network sharing or consolidation among our tenants, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors—If our tenants consolidate their operations, exit the telecommunications business or share site infrastructure to a significant degree, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.” In addition, the emergence and growth of new technologies could reduce demand for our sites, as set forth under the caption “Risk Factors—New technologies or changes in our or a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results.” Further, our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites.Property Operations New Site Revenue Growth. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 24,465 sites globally, as well as the acquisition of certain urban telecommunications assets in Brazil. In a majority of our Asia, EMEA and Latin America markets, the revenue generated from newly acquired or constructed sites resulted in increases in both tenant and pass-through revenues (such as ground rent or power and fuel costs) and expenses. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios, both domestically and internationally, to determine whether they meet our risk-adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio. New Sites (Acquired or Constructed)2018 2017 2016U.S.285 635 65Asia21,470 1,135 43,865EMEA1,055 2,755 665Latin America1,655 2,360 715Property Operations Expenses. Direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes, repairs and maintenance. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled Selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our property segments’ selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our sites and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new tenants on our sites provides significant incremental cash flow. We may, however, incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets. Our 27Table of Contentsprofit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our sites but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities.Services Segment Revenue Growth. As we continue to focus on growing our property operations, we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIncluded in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (“Adjusted EBITDA”), Funds From Operations, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit FFO”) attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations (“Consolidated AFFO”) and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders.We define Adjusted EBITDA as Net income before Income (loss) from equity method investments; Income tax benefit (provision); Other income (expense); Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; Interest expense; Interest income; Other operating income (expense); Depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense. Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interests. In this section, we refer to Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “Nareit FFO (common stockholders).” We define Consolidated AFFO as Nareit FFO (common stockholders) before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) the deferred portion of income tax; (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion; (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges; (vi) other income (expense); (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; (viii) other operating income (expense); and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interests, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures. We define AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as Consolidated AFFO, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both Nareit FFO (common stockholders) and the other adjustments included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. In this section, we refer to AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “AFFO (common stockholders).” Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. None of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO or AFFO (common stockholders) represents cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or a measure of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for decision making purposes and for evaluating our operating segments’ performance; (2) Adjusted EBITDA is a component underlying our credit ratings; (3) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4) Consolidated AFFO is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to adjust Nareit FFO (common stockholders) for items that may otherwise cause material fluctuations in Nareit FFO (common stockholders) growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of property assets in those periods; (5) each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (6) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies, particularly those in our industry. Our measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included below.28Table of ContentsResults of OperationsYears Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in millions, except percentages)Revenue Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2018 vs 2017 Percent Change 2017 vs 2016 2018 2017 2016 Property U.S.$3,822.1 $3,605.7 $3,370.1 6% 7%Asia1,540.5 1,164.4 827.6 32 41EMEA687.3 626.2 529.5 10 18Latin America1,264.8 1,169.6 985.9 8 19Total property7,314.7 6,565.9 5,713.1 11 15Services125.4 98.0 72.6 28 35Total revenues$7,440.1 $6,663.9 $5,785.7 12% 15%Year ended December 31, 2018 U.S. property segment revenue growth of $216.4 million was attributable to: • Tenant billings growth of $264.0 million, which was driven by:•$188.5 million due to colocations and amendments; •$59.6 million from contractual escalations, net of churn; and•$21.0 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites; •Partially offset by a decrease of $5.1 million from other tenant billings; and• A decrease of $47.6 million in other revenue, which includes an $81.3 million decrease due to straight-line accounting.Asia property segment revenue growth of $376.1 million was attributable to:•Tenant billings growth of $31.0 million, which was driven by:•$123.7 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites, including $117.7 million from the transactions with Vodafone (the “Vodafone Acquisition”) and Idea (the “Idea Acquisition”);•$49.5 million due to colocations and amendments; and•$0.6 million from other tenant billings;•Partially offset by a decrease of $142.8 million resulting from churn in excess of contractual escalations, including $128.1 million due to carrier consolidation-driven churn in India; •Pass-through revenue growth of $59.7 million; and•An increase of $349.3 million in other revenue, primarily due to the net impact of our settlement with Tata and a decrease in revenue reserves.

Also contributing to the increase was the acquisition, lease or construction of new sites since the beginning of the prior-year period, which resulted in an increase in property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization. The increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the acquisition, lease or construction of new sites since the beginning of the prior-year period, which resulted in an increase in property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization.

The impairment charges included $258.3 million related to tower and network intangible assets and $107.3 million related to tenant relationships in our Asia property segment due to the settlement with Tata, Aircel’s filing for bankruptcy protection and other carrier consolidation-driven churn in India. The increase was also attributable to the nonrecurrence of a $22.2 million refund of acquisition costs recorded in the prior-year period related to an acquisition in Brazil, partially offset by $10.0 million to fund our charitable foundation in the prior-year period.The increase in other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in impairment charges of $182.9 million. These charges included $81.0 million related to tower and network intangible assets and $100.1 million related to tenant relationships in our Asia property segment, primarily due to carrier consolidation-driven churn. The increase in other operating expenses also included an increase of $7.7 million in losses on sales or disposals of assets and $10.0 million to fund our charitable foundation.

We record unrealized foreign currency gains or losses as a result of foreign currency fluctuations primarily associated with our intercompany notes and similar unaffiliated balances denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies.The increase in total other expense during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to additional interest expense of $75.9 million due to a $2.0 billion increase in our average debt outstanding and foreign currency losses of $4.5 million in the current period, compared to foreign currency gains of $26.4 million in the prior-year period. The increase was partially offset by (i) a decrease in loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $66.9 million due to the nonrecurrence of a loss of $70.2 million recorded in the prior-year period attributable to the redemptions of the 7.25% senior unsecured notes due 2019 (the “7.25% Notes”) and the 4.500% senior unsecured notes due 2018 (the “4.500% Notes”) and the repayment of the Secured Cellular Site Revenue Notes, Series 2012-2 Class A, Series 2012-2 Class B and Series 2012-2 Class C and Secured Cellular Site Revenue Notes, Series 2010-2, Class C and Series 2010-2, Class F (collectively, the “GTP Notes”), (ii) an increase in other income of $23.4 million partially due to the write-offs of the capital lease liability and Economic Rights Agreement and related amortization in conjunction with the note extinguishment with TV Azteca (as described in note 5 to our consolidated 34Table of Contentsfinancial statements included in this Annual Report) and (iii) an additional $19.3 million in interest income, compared to the prior-year period.The increase in total other expense during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $70.2 million attributable to the redemptions of the 7.25% Notes and the 4.500% Notes and the repayment of the GTP Notes, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, where we recorded a gain on retirement of long-term obligations of $1.2 million attributable to the repayment of the Secured Tower Cellular Site Revenue Notes, Series 2012-1, Class A and the Secured Cellular Site Revenue Notes, Series 2010-1, Class C. The increase was also attributable to additional interest expense of $32.5 million due to a $0.9 billion increase in our average debt outstanding. These items were partially offset by foreign currency gains of $26.4 million compared to foreign currency losses of $48.9 million in the prior-year period, as well an additional $9.8 million in interest income compared to the prior-year period.Income Tax (Benefit) Provision Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2018 vs 2017 Percent Change 2017 vs 2016 2018 2017 2016 Income tax (benefit) provision $(110.1) $30.7 $155.5 (459)% (80)%Effective tax rate (9.5)% 2.4% 13.8% As a REIT, we may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated by our REIT operations. In addition, we are able to offset certain income by utilizing our NOLs, subject to specified limitations. Consequently, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 differs from the federal statutory rate.The change in the income tax (benefit) provision for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to the receipt of the payment associated with the Tata settlement, offset by the deferred tax benefit of impairment charges and accelerated amortization in India. Additionally, we restructured our international operations in certain jurisdictions resulting in a current-year benefit of $85.7 million, which was offset by the nonrecurrence of prior-year benefit from a clarification in income tax law in Ghana. The decrease in the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to lower uncertain tax position reserve recorded in 2017 than in 2016, a decrease in foreign earnings in India due to impairments, as well as changes in tax laws in certain foreign jurisdictions.Net Income / Adjusted EBITDA and Net Income / Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders / Consolidated AFFO / AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2018 vs 2017 Percent Change 2017 vs 2016 2018 2017 2016 Net income $1,264.7 $1,225.4 $970.4 3 % 26 %Income tax (benefit) provision (110.1) 30.7 155.5 (459) (80)Other (income) expense (23.8) (31.3) 47.7 (24) (166)Loss (gain) on retirement of long-term obligations 3.3 70.2 (1.2) (95) (5,950)Interest expense 825.5 749.6 717.1 10 5Interest income (54.7) (35.4) (25.6) 55 38Other operating expenses 513.3 256.0 73.3 101 249Depreciation, amortization and accretion 2,110.8 1,715.9 1,525.6 23 12Stock-based compensation expense 137.5 108.5 89.9 27 21Adjusted EBITDA $4,666.5 $4,089.6 $3,552.7 14 % 15 %35Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2018 vs 2017 Percent Change 2017 vs 2016 2018 2017 2016 Net income$1,264.7 $1,225.4 $970.4 3 % 26 %Real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion1,915.2 1,516.9 1,358.9 26 12Losses from sale or disposal of real estate and real estate related impairment charges (1)479.7 244.4 54.5 96 348Dividends on preferred stock(9.4) (87.4) (107.1) (89) (18)Dividend to noncontrolling interest(13.8) (13.2) — 5 100Adjustments for unconsolidated affiliates and noncontrolling interests (427.4) (189.1) (88.2) 126 114Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders$3,209.0 $2,697.0 $2,188.5 19 23Straight-line revenue(87.6) (194.4) (131.7) (55) 48Straight-line expense57.9 62.3 67.8 (7) (8)Stock-based compensation expense137.5 108.5 89.9 27 21Deferred portion of income tax (2)(274.0) (105.8) 59.2 159 (279)Non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion195.6 199.0 166.7 (2) 19Amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges19.0 26.8 23.1 (29) 16Other (income) expense (3)(23.8) (31.3) 47.7 (24) (166)Loss (gain) on retirement of long-term obligations3.3 70.2 (1.2) (95) (5,950)Other operating expenses (4)33.6 11.6 18.8 190 (38)Capital improvement capital expenditures(149.5) (114.2) (110.2) 31 4Corporate capital expenditures(9.2) (17.0) (16.4) (46) 4Adjustments for unconsolidated affiliates and noncontrolling interests 427.4 189.1 88.2 126 114Consolidated AFFO $3,539.2 $2,901.8 $2,490.4 22 % 17 %Adjustments for unconsolidated affiliates and noncontrolling interests (5)(348.7) (147.0) (90.2) 137 % 63 %AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders$3,190.5 $2,754.8$2,400.2 16 % 15 %_______________(1)Included in these amounts are impairment charges of $394.0 million, $211.4 million and $28.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.(2)For the year ended December 31, 2018, amount includes a tax benefit primarily attributable to the tax effect of an increase in impairment charges and a one-time benefit for restructuring-related activity in foreign jurisdictions offset by the nonrecurrence of prior-year benefit from a clarification in income tax law in Ghana.(3)Includes losses (gains) on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of $4.5 million, ($26.4 million) and $48.9 million, respectively.(4)Primarily includes acquisition-related costs and integration costs.

Additionally, we use our cash flows to make distributions, including distributions of our REIT taxable income to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We may also repay or repurchase our existing indebtedness or equity from time to time. We typically fund our international expansion efforts primarily through a combination of cash on hand, intercompany debt and equity contributions. In the fourth quarter of 2018, two of our minority holders in India exercised their put options with respect to certain shares in our Indian subsidiary, ATC TIPL in accordance with the provisions in the 38Table of Contentsshareholder agreement (see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Accordingly, we expect to pay 29.4 billion INR (approximately $420.0 million) to redeem the put shares in the first half of 2019.As of December 31, 2018, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $21.3 billion, with a current portion of $2.8 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and debt service obligations, as well as our required distributions. We believe the cash generated by operating activities during the year ending December 31, 2019, together with our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our required distributions, capital expenditures, debt service obligations (interest and principal repayments) and signed acquisitions. As of December 31, 2018, we had $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $711.6 million was held by our joint ventures. While certain subsidiaries may pay us interest or principal on intercompany debt, it has not been our practice to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs. However, in the event that we do repatriate any funds, we may be required to accrue and pay certain taxes.Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesFor the year ended December 31, 2018, cash provided by operating activities increased $822.7 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.

On May 22, 2018, we completed a registered public offering of 500.0 million EUR ($589.0 million at the date of issuance) aggregate principal amount of the 1.950% Notes. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately 493.2 million EUR (approximately $581.0 million at the date of issuance), after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. We used the net proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under the 2013 Credit Facility.The 1.950% Notes will mature on May 22, 2026 and bear interest at a rate of 1.950% per annum. Accrued and unpaid interest on the 1.950% Notes will be payable in EUR in arrears on May 22 of each year, beginning on May 22, 2019. Interest on the 1.950% Notes will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated and the actual number of days from and including the last date on which interest was paid on the 1.950% Notes and commenced accruing on May 22, 2018.We may redeem the 1.950% Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date. If we redeem the 1.950% Notes on or after February 22, 2026, we will not be required to pay a make-whole premium. In addition, if we undergo a change of control and corresponding ratings decline, each as defined in the supplemental indenture, we may be required to repurchase all of the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if any), up to but not including the repurchase date. The notes rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries. The supplemental indenture contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and our (together with our subsidiaries’) ability to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that we and our subsidiaries may incur certain liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness if the aggregate amount of such liens does not exceed 3.5x Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the supplemental indenture.SecuritizationsRepayment of Series 2013-1A Securities. On the March 2018 payment date, we repaid the $500.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Series 2013-1A Securities, pursuant to the terms of the agreements governing such securities. The repayment was funded with borrowings under the 2014 Credit Facility and cash on hand. Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A and Series 2018-1, Subclass R. On March 29, 2018, we completed the 2018 Securitization in which the American Tower Trust I (the “Trust”) issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Series 2018-1A Securities. To satisfy the applicable risk retention requirements of Regulation RR promulgated under the Exchange Act (such requirements, the “Risk Retention Rules”), the Trust issued, and one of our affiliates purchased, $26.4 million aggregate principal amount of Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R (the “Series 2018-1R Securities” and, together with the Series 2018-1A Securities, the “2018 Securities”) to retain an “eligible horizontal residual interest” (as defined in the Risk Retention Rules) in an amount equal to at least 5% of the fair value of the 2018 Securities. The assets of the Trust consist of a nonrecourse loan (the “Loan”) made by the Trust to American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the “AMT Asset Subs”). The AMT Asset Subs are jointly and severally liable under the Loan, which is secured primarily by mortgages on the AMT Asset Subs’ interests in 5,116 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets (the “Trust Sites”).The 2018 Securities correspond to components of the Loan made to the AMT Asset Subs pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement among the Trust and the AMT Asset Subs, dated as of March 29, 2018 (the “Loan Agreement”) and were issued in two separate subclasses of the same series. The 2018 Securities represent a pass-through interest in the components of the Loan corresponding to the 2018 Securities. The Series 2018-1A Securities have an interest rate of 3.652% and the Series 2018-1R Securities have an interest rate of 4.459%. The 2018 Securities have an expected life of approximately ten years with a final repayment date in March 2048.The AMT Asset Subs may prepay the Loan in whole or in part at any time provided it is accompanied by applicable prepayment consideration. If the prepayment occurs within 36 months of the anticipated repayment date for the component of 41Table of Contentsthe Loan corresponding to the 2018 Securities, no prepayment consideration is due. The entire unpaid principal balance of the components of the Loan corresponding to the 2018 Securities will be due in March 2048.The Loan is secured by (1) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the Trust Sites and their operating cash flows, (2) a security interest in substantially all of the AMT Asset Subs’ personal property and fixtures and (3) the AMT Asset Subs’ rights under that certain management agreement among the AMT Asset Subs and SpectraSite Communications, LLC entered into in March 2013. American Tower Holding Sub, LLC (the “Guarantor”), whose only material assets are its equity interests in each of the AMT Asset Subs, and American Tower Guarantor Sub, LLC whose only material asset is its equity interests in the Guarantor, have each guaranteed repayment of the Loan and pledged their equity interests in their respective subsidiary or subsidiaries as security for such payment obligations.The Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A (the “Series 2013-2A Securities”) issued in the 2013 Securitization remain outstanding and are subject to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Trust and Servicing Agreement entered into in connection with the 2018 Securitization. The component of the Loan corresponding to the Series 2013-2A Securities also remains outstanding and is subject to the terms of the Loan Agreement.For more information regarding the Trust Securitizations, see “—Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity” below.Bank FacilitiesOn November 28, 2018, we entered into amendment agreements with respect to the 2013 Credit Facility, the 2014 Credit Facility and the 2013 Term Loan, which, among other things, (i) extend the maturity dates by one year to June 28, 2022, January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024, respectively, (ii) increase the commitments under each of the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility by $100.0 million to $2.85 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, (iii) increase the maximum Revolving Loan Commitments, after giving effect to any Incremental Commitments (each as defined in the applicable loan agreement) to $4.5 billion and $3.25 billion under the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility, respectively, (iv) amend the limitation on indebtedness of, and guaranteed by, our subsidiaries to the greater of (x) $2.5 billion and (y) 50% of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the applicable loan agreement) of us and our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, (v) increase the threshold for certain defaults with respect to judgments, attachments or acceleration of indebtedness from $300.0 million to $400.0 million and (vi) add provisions regarding the establishment of an alternative rate of interest in the event that LIBOR is no longer available. In addition, the amendments to the 2014 Credit Facility and the 2013 Term Loan reduce the Applicable Margins (as defined in the applicable loan agreement) to conform to the Applicable Margins in the 2013 Credit Facility (as defined therein).2013 Credit Facility. We have the ability to borrow up to $2.85 billion under the 2013 Credit Facility, which includes a $1.0 billion sublimit for multicurrency borrowings, a $200.0 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $50.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we borrowed an aggregate of $2.1 billion and repaid an aggregate of $2.3 billion of revolving indebtedness. We used the borrowings to fund acquisitions, repay existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. We currently have $3.8 million of undrawn letters of credit and maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the 2013 Credit Facility in the ordinary course. 2014 Credit Facility. We have the ability to borrow up to $2.1 billion under the 2014 Credit Facility, which includes a $200.0 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $50.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we borrowed an aggregate of $1.1 billion and repaid an aggregate of $1.5 billion of revolving indebtedness. We used the borrowings to repay existing indebtedness, including the Series 2013-1A Securities, to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. We currently have $6.2 million of undrawn letters of credit and maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the 2014 Credit Facility in the ordinary course. 2018 Term Loan. On March 29, 2018, we entered into the 2018 Term Loan, the net proceeds of which were used to repay $1.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness under the 2013 Credit Facility and $445.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under the 2014 Credit Facility. The 2018 Term Loan had a maturity date of March 29, 2019. On February 14, 2019, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the 2018 Term Loan with proceeds from the 2019 Term Loan (as defined below) and cash on hand.As of December 31, 2018, the key terms under the 2013 Credit Facility, the 2014 Credit Facility, the 2013 Term Loan and the 2018 Term Loan were as follows:42Table of ContentsBank Facility (1)Outstanding Principal BalanceMaturity Date LIBOR borrowing interest rate range (2)Base rate borrowing interest rate range (2)Current margin over LIBOR and the base rate, respectively2013 Credit Facility$1,875.0June 28, 2022(3)0.875% - 1.750%0.000% - 0.750%1.125% and 0.125%2014 Credit Facility$—January 31, 2024(3)0.875% - 1.750%0.000% - 0.750%1.125% and 0.125%2013 Term Loan$1,000.0January 31, 2024 0.875% - 1.750%0.000% - 0.750%1.125% and 0.125%2018 Term Loan$1,500.0March 29, 2019 0.625% - 1.500%0.000% - 0.500%0.875% and 0.000%_______________(1) Currently borrowed at LIBOR.(2)Represents interest rate above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings and the interest rate above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on our debt ratings.(3)Subject to two optional renewal periods.The 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility are subject to two optional renewal periods and we must pay a quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of each facility. The commitment fee for the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility ranges from 0.100% to 0.350% per annum, based upon our debt ratings, and is currently 0.125%. 2019 Term Loan. On February 14, 2019, we entered into a $1.3 billion unsecured term loan (the “2019 Term Loan”), the net proceeds of which were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the 2018 Term Loan. The 2019 Term Loan matures on February 13, 2020 and has an interest rate that ranges between 0.550% and 1.375% above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or up to 0.375% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based upon our debt ratings. The current margin over LIBOR for the 2019 Term Loan is 0.800%. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity.The 2013 Credit Facility, the 2014 Credit Facility, the 2013 Term Loan and the 2019 Term Loan do not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. We have the option of choosing either a defined base rate or the LIBOR as the applicable base rate for borrowings under these bank facilities.The loan agreements for each of the 2013 Credit Facility, the 2014 Credit Facility, the 2013 Term Loan and the 2019 Term Loan contain certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply. Failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreements could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facilities, but may constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. India Indebtedness. Amounts outstanding and key terms of the India indebtedness consisted of the following as of December 31, 2018 (in millions, except percentages): Amount Outstanding (INR) Amount Outstanding (USD) Interest Rate (Range) Maturity Date (Range)Term loans (1) 16,751 $240.1 8.75% - 8.95% January 1, 2019 - November 30, 2024Working capital facilities (2) — $— 8.40% - 8.75% March 18, 2019 - October 23, 2019_______________(1) In January 2019, we repaid approximately 5.0 billion INR ($72.0 million) of India indebtedness.(2) 5.7 billion INR ($81.8 million) of borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2018. The India indebtedness includes several term loans, with maturities ranging from one to ten years, which are generally secured by the borrower’s short-term and long-term assets. Each of the term loans bear interest at the applicable bank’s Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (as defined in the applicable agreement), plus a spread. Interest rates on the term loans are fixed until certain reset dates. Generally, the term loans can be repaid without penalty on the reset dates; repayments at dates other than the reset dates are subject to prepayment penalties, typically of 1% to 2%. Scheduled repayment terms include either ratable or staggered amortization with repayments typically commencing between six and thirty-six months after the initial disbursement of funds.The India indebtedness also includes several working capital facilities, most of which are subject to annual renewal, and which are generally secured by the borrower’s short-term and long-term assets. The working capital facilities bear interest at rates that consist of the applicable bank’s Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (as defined in the applicable agreement), plus a spread. Generally, the working capital facilities are payable on demand prior to maturity.43Table of ContentsStock Repurchase Programs. We have two stock repurchase programs, the 2011 Buyback and the 2017 Buyback.During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased 1,647,489 shares of our common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $232.8 million, including commissions and fees. We had no repurchases under the 2017 Buyback.Under each program, we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases, in privately negotiated transactions not to exceed market prices, and (with respect to such open market purchases) pursuant to plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. We expect to continue managing the pacing of the remaining $2.1 billion under the Buyback Programs in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors. We expect to fund further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Purchases under the Buyback Programs are subject to us having available cash to fund repurchases. Sales of Equity Securities. We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plans. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we received an aggregate of $98.9 million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and sales pursuant to the ESPP.Distributions. As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we have distributed, and expect to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income after taking into consideration our utilization of NOLs. We have distributed an aggregate of approximately $5.7 billion to our common stockholders, including the dividend paid in January 2019, primarily classified as ordinary income that may be treated as qualified REIT dividends under Section 199A of the Code for taxable years ending after 2017 and before 2026.The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.In March 2015, we issued 5.50% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) with a dividend rate of 5.50%. Dividends were payable quarterly in arrears, subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. On February 15, 2018, we paid the final dividend of $13.75 per share, or $18.9 million, to holders of the Series B Preferred Stock of record at the close of business on February 1, 2018. On February 15, 2018, all outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock converted at a rate of 8.7420 per share of Series B Preferred Stock, or 0.8742 per depositary share, each representing a 1/10th interest in a share of Series B Preferred Stock, into shares of our common stock pursuant to the provisions of the Certificate of Designations governing the Series B Preferred Stock. As a result of the conversions of the Series B Preferred Stock in 2018, we issued an aggregate of 12,020,064 shares of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we paid $3.01 per share, or $1.3 billion, to common stockholders of record. In addition, we declared a distribution of $0.84 per share, or $370.5 million, paid on January 14, 2019 to our common stockholders of record at the close of business on December 27, 2018.We accrue distributions on unvested restricted stock units, which are payable upon vesting. The amount accrued for distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units was $13.7 million and $10.1 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we paid $4.3 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units. For more details on the cash distributions paid to our common and preferred stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2018, see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.Contractual Obligations.

(12)Excludes $85.8 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and $19.1 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled. Settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe. However, based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements, we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities, borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness. We believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants, our compliance with which would be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity. Internally Generated Funds. Because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2018 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities depends upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites.Restrictions Under Loan Agreements Relating to Our Credit Facilities. The loan agreements for the 2013 Credit Facility, the 2014 Credit Facility, the 2013 Term Loan, the 2018 Term Loan and the 2019 Term Loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These restrictions include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage, as set forth in the table below. In the event that our debt ratings fall below investment grade, we must also maintain an interest coverage ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense (each as defined in the applicable loan agreement) of at least 2.50:1.00. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. Compliance Tests For The 12 Months Ended December 31, 2018 ($ in billions) Ratio (1) Additional Debt Capacity Under Covenants (2) Capacity for Adjusted EBITDA Decrease Under Covenants (3)Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 6.00:1.00 ~ $7.6 ~ $1.3Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio Senior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 3.00:1.00 ~ $11.2 (4) ~ $3.7 (4)_______________46Table of Contents(1) Each component of the ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement.(2) Assumes no change to Adjusted EBITDA.(3) Assumes no change to our debt levels. (4) Effectively, however, additional Senior Secured Debt under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio.The loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants.Failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but may constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants.Restrictions Under Agreements Relating to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations. The indenture and related supplemental indentures governing the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1, Class A (the “Series 2015-1 Notes”) and the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the “Series 2015-2 Notes,” and, together with the Series 2015-1 Notes, the “2015 Notes”) issued by GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC (“GTP Acquisition Partners”) in the 2015 Securitization and the loan agreement related to the Trust Securitizations include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, GTP Acquisition Partners and the AMT Asset Subs are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets, subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the applicable agreement). Under the agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the 2015 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement, subject to the conditions described in the table below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs, as applicable, which can then be distributed to, and used by, us. As of December 31, 2018, $80.1 million held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash. Certain information with respect to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations is set forth below. The debt service coverage ratio (“DSCR”) is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination. 47Table of Contents Issuer or BorrowerNotes/Securities IssuedConditions Limiting Distributions of Excess CashExcess Cash Distributed During Year Ended December 31, 2018DSCR as of December 31, 2018Capacity for Decrease in Net Cash Flow Before Triggering Cash Trap DSCR (1)Capacity for Decrease in Net Cash Flow Before Triggering Minimum DSCR (1)Cash Trap DSCRAmortization Period (in millions) (in millions)(in millions)2015 SecuritizationGTP Acquisition PartnersAmerican Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1 and Series 2015-21.30x, Tested Quarterly (2)(3)(4)$197.38.67x$196.9$200.9Trust SecuritizationsAMT Asset SubsSecured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A, Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A and Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R1.30x, Tested Quarterly (2)(3)(5)$612.910.65x$558.4$567.4_______________(1)Based on the net cash flow of the applicable issuer or borrower as of December 31, 2018 and the expenses payable over the next 12 months on the 2015 Notes or the Loan, as applicable. (2)Once triggered, a Cash Trap DSCR condition continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. During a Cash Trap DSCR condition, all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account (the “Cash Trap Reserve Account”) instead of being released to the applicable issuer or borrower. (3)An amortization period commences if the DSCR is equal to or below 1.15x (the “Minimum DSCR”) at the end of any calendar quarter and continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. (4)No amortization period is triggered if the outstanding principal amount of a series has not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date. However, in such event, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the applicable series, and such series will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow.(5)An amortization period exists if the outstanding principal amount has not been paid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date and continues to exist until such principal has been repaid in full. A failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions and meet REIT distribution requirements. During an “amortization period,” all excess cash flow and any amounts in the applicable Cash Trap Reserve Account would be applied to pay principal of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, on each monthly payment date, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Further, additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any series of the 2015 Notes or subclass of the Loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement. With respect to the 2015 Notes, upon the occurrence and during an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of the 2015 Notes, declare such series of 2015 Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes. Furthermore, if GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs were to default on a series of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 3,556 communications sites that secure the 2015 Notes or the 5,116 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets that secure the Loan, respectively, in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assets.As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our distribution requirements and repay or repurchase our debt. If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and debt service obligations or refinance our existing indebtedness.48Table of ContentsIn addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and, consequently, a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2018. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.•Impairment of Assets—Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization: We review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable. We review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements.We review our tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenant-related intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment.On February 28, 2018, one of our tenants in Asia, Aircel, filed for bankruptcy protection. We performed an impairment test based on current expectations of the impact of the bankruptcy on projected cash flows for assets related to Aircel. These assets consisted primarily of towers, network location intangibles and tenant-related intangibles. As a result, an impairment of $40.1 million was taken on the tower and network intangible assets. We also fully impaired the tenant-related intangible asset for Aircel, which resulted in an impairment of $107.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.In October 2017, one of our tenants in Asia, Tata Teleservices, informed the Department of Telecommunications in India of its intent to exit the wireless telecommunications business and announced plans to transfer its business to another telecommunications provider. On October 23, 2018, we entered into agreements with Tata for a settlement and release of certain contractual lease obligations effective November 1, 2018. As part of the arrangement, we received an upfront one-time INR-denominated cash payment equal to approximately $345.5 million for the termination of lease obligations with Tata Teleservices in India. In addition, we entered into new leasing arrangements with a number of Tata-affiliated entities. As a result of the settlement and new leasing agreements, we expect an approximately 80% reduction in revenues from Tata as compared to what had previously been generated from the terminated leases. In connection with the acceleration of the contractual arrangements, we also accelerated the amortization of our tenant-49Table of Contentsrelated intangible asset with Tata Teleservices, which resulted in an additional amortization expense of $327.5 million in 2018. We also recorded an impairment of $164.2 million for tower and network location intangible assets as a result of the settlement.Impairment of Assets—Goodwill: We review goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.Goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. We utilize the two step impairment test and employ a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. Under the first step of this test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, we conduct the second step of this test, in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess.During the year ended December 31, 2018, no potential impairment was identified as the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount. The fair value of our India reporting unit, which is based on the present value of forecasted future value cash flows (the income approach) exceeded the carrying value by approximately $311.1 million, or 8%. Key assumptions include future revenue growth rates and operating margins, capital expenditures, terminal period growth rate and the weighted-average cost of capital, which were determined considering historical data and current assumptions related to the impacts of the carrier consolidation. For this reporting unit, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that a (i) 6% reduction of projected revenues, (ii) 58 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of capital or (iii) 28% reduction in terminal sales growth rate, individually, each of which we determined to be reasonable, would impact our conclusion that the fair value of the India reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. Events that could negatively affect our India reporting unit’s financial results include increased customer attrition exceeding our forecast resulting from the ongoing carrier consolidation, carrier tenant bankruptcies and other factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors.”The carrying value of goodwill in the India reporting unit was $1,045.5 million as of December 31, 2018, which represents 19% of our consolidated balance of $5,501.9 million.•Asset Retirement Obligations: When required, we recognize the fair value of obligations to remove our tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of our tower assets are located. Generally, the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. We updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net decrease in the estimated obligation of $14.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The change in 2018 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary.•Acquisitions: We evaluate each of our acquisitions under the accounting guidance framework to determine whether to treat an acquisition as an asset acquisition or a business combination. For those transactions treated as asset acquisitions, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired, with no recognition of goodwill. For those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, we apply the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with our results from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We continue to 50Table of Contentsevaluate acquisitions accounted for as business combinations for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future tenant cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition. •Revenue Recognition: Our revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is probable. Escalation clauses tied to the Consumer Price Index or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total property straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $87.6 million, $194.4 million and $131.7 million, respectively. Amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable lease arrangements. Amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met.We derive the largest portion of our revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, with 51% of our revenues derived from four tenants. In addition, we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. We mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our borrowers and tenants. In recognizing tenant revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense. Accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured.•Rent Expense: Many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time. In addition, certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. We calculate straight-line ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. Effective January 1, 2019, we will adopt the new lease accounting guidance, which requires us to recognize a Right of Use (“ROU”) lease asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases. The ROU asset will be measured as the sum of the lease liability, prepaid or accrued lease payments, any initial direct costs incurred and any other applicable amounts. The calculation of the lease liability requires us to make certain assumptions for each lease, including lease term and discount rate implicit in each lease, which could significantly impact the gross lease obligation, the duration and the present value of the lease liability. When calculating the lease term, we will consider the renewal, cancellation and termination rights available to us and the lessor. We will determine the discount rate by calculating the incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis at the commencement of a lease or upon a change in the lease term. •Income Taxes: Accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes. To the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes, deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns, which may differ from the current rate. We do not expect to pay federal income taxes on our REIT taxable income.We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management 51Table of Contentsassesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes, if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability.We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination, which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit.The December 2017 legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) significantly changed how the U.S. taxes corporations. The Tax Act contains several key provisions including, among other things, a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation of all post-1986 untaxed foreign earnings and profits, a reduction in the corporate income rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and the introduction of a new U.S. tax on certain off-shore earnings. The SEC staff issued guidance to address the application of GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act and allows the registrant to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date. We recognized the provisional impacts of the Tax Act in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 and finalized these amounts in 2018 with no significant changes to preliminary amounts.

This swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge, has a notional amount of $16.9 million and has an interest rate of 5.74% and expires in April 2021. We have three interest rate swap agreements related to the 2.250% Notes. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of $600.0 million and an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expire in January 2022. In addition, we have three interest rate swap agreements related to a portion of the 3.000% Notes. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of $500.0 million and have an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expire in June 2023. Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2018 consisted of $1.9 billion under the 2013 Credit Facility, $1.0 billion under the 2013 Term Loan, $1.5 billion under the 2018 Term Loan, $600.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 2.250% Notes, $500.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 3.000% Notes, $40.6 million under the South African credit facility, $16.9 million under the Colombian credit facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements and $24.7 million under the Brazil credit facility. A 10% increase in current interest rates would result in an additional $20.2 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018. 53Table of ContentsForeign Currency RiskWe are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar is reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. For the year ended December 31, 2018, 47% of our revenues and 57% of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies.As of December 31, 2018, we have incurred intercompany debt that is not considered to be permanently reinvested, and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As this debt had not been designated as being a long-term investment in nature, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. An adverse change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in $110.9 million of unrealized losses that would be included in Other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.",2023-12-30 19:23:39.736180

The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the accompanying notes, and the information set forth under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” below. During the fourth quarter of 2019, as a result of recent acquisitions, including the Eaton Towers Acquisition, and changes to our organizational structure, we reviewed and changed our reportable segments to divide our EMEA segment into two separate segments, Africa property and Europe property. We now report our results in six segments – U.S. property, Asia property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property and services. We believe this change provides more visibility into these operating segments and better aligns our reporting with management’s current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments. In evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses, among other factors, segment gross margin and segment operating profit (see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). The change in reportable segments has no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any periods. Historical financial information included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations has been adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments. Executive OverviewWe are one of the largest global REITs and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. We refer to this business as our property operations, which accounted for 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 and includes our U.S. property, Asia property, Africa property, Europe property and Latin America property segments. We also offer tower-related services in the United States, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting and structural analysis, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. 22Table of ContentsThe following table details the number of communications sites, excluding managed sites, that we owned or operated as of December 31, 2019: Number ofOwned Towers Number ofOperated Towers (1) Number ofOwned DAS SitesDomestic: United States 25,003 15,564 407Asia: India (2) 73,633 — 1,079Africa Burkina Faso 664 — —Ghana 3,157 665 27Kenya 2,060 — 9Niger 677 — —Nigeria 5,207 — —South Africa (2) 2,711 — —Uganda 3,181 — 12Africa total 17,657 665 48Europe France 2,207 309 9Germany 2,211 — —Europe total 4,418 309 9Latin America: Argentina (3) 94 — 10Brazil (3) 16,706 2,258 103Chile 2,583 — 22Colombia 5,005 — 2Costa Rica 621 — 2Mexico (4) 9,427 187 92Paraguay 1,420 — —Peru 1,792 404 —Latin America total 37,648 2,849 231_______________(1)Approximately 95% of the operated towers are held pursuant to long-term finance leases, including those subject to purchase options. (2)In India and South Africa, we also own fiber. (3)In Argentina and Brazil, we also own or operate urban telecommunications assets, including fiber, and the rights to utilize certain existing utility infrastructure for future telecommunications equipment installation. (4)In Mexico, we also own or operate urban telecommunications assets, including fiber, concrete poles and other infrastructure. In most of our markets, our tenant leases with wireless carriers generally have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. Accordingly, the vast majority of the revenue generated by our property operations during the year ended December 31, 2019 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2019, we expect to generate nearly $46.9 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting. Most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically based on an annual fixed escalation (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in our international markets, or a combination of both. In addition, certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs. The revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts, which typically are non-cancellable; however, in some instances, a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee.Revenue lost from either tenant lease cancellations or the non-renewal of leases or rent renegotiations, which we refer to as churn, has historically not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our consolidated property operations. 23Table of ContentsDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, churn was approximately 6% of our tenant billings. The higher than historical level of churn was largely due to carrier consolidation events in India. Beginning in late 2017, we experienced an increase in revenue lost from cancellations or non-renewals primarily due to carrier consolidation-driven churn in India, which compressed our gross margin and operating profit, particularly in our Asia property segment, although this impact was partially offset by lower expenses due to reduced tenancy on existing sites and the decommissioning of certain sites. We anticipate that our churn rate in India will move closer to historical levels over time and result in reduced impacts on our property revenue, gross margin and operating profit. In the immediate term, we expect that our churn rate will remain elevated, primarily due the uncertainty created by the recent court ruling by the Indian Supreme Court, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under under the captions “Risk Factors—A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants” and “Risk Factors—Our business, and that of our tenants, is subject to laws, regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, and changes thereto, that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape.” We expect to periodically evaluate the carrying value of our Indian assets, which may result in the realization of additional impairment expense or other similar charges. For more information, please see the information under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.”For the year ended December 31, 2019, aggregate carrier consolidation in India negatively impacted our consolidated property revenue by $361.3 million, including approximately $84.2 million in pass-through revenue, and negatively impacted our gross margin and operating profit by $247.7 million.Property Operations Revenue Growth. Due to our diversified communications site portfolio, our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. We measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. In many instances, tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation capital expenditures.The primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our property segments are:•Growth in tenant billings, including:•New revenue attributable to leases in place on day one on sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior-year period;•New revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our sites (“colocations”) and lease amendments; and•Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of churn. •Revenue growth from other items, including additional tenant payments primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs included in certain tenant leases (“pass-through”), straight-line revenue and decommissioning.We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services globally and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our communications real estate. By adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, we are able to increase these sites’ utilization and profitability. We believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers, with tenants in a number of other industries contributing incremental leasing demand. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks, while also deploying next generation wireless technologies. In addition, we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk-adjusted return on investment objectives. Property Operations Organic Revenue Growth. Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment from our sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers and other tenants deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless services, the penetration of advanced wireless devices, the level of emphasis on network quality and capacity in carrier competition, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions. According to industry data, recent aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the United States has averaged approximately $30.0 billion, resulting in consistent demand for our sites. 24Table of ContentsBased on industry research and projections, we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us:•In less advanced wireless markets where initial voice and data networks are still being deployed, we expect these deployments to drive demand for our tower space as carriers seek to expand their footprints and increase the scope and density of their networks. We have established operations in many of these markets at the early stages of wireless development, which we believe will enable us to meaningfully participate in these deployments over the long term.•Subscribers’ use of mobile data continues to grow rapidly given increasing smartphone and other advanced device penetration, the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications on these devices and the continuing evolution of the mobile ecosystem. We believe carriers will be compelled to deploy additional equipment on existing networks while also rolling out more advanced wireless networks to address coverage and capacity needs resulting from this increasing mobile data usage.•The deployment of advanced mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G, across existing wireless networks will provide higher speed data services and further enable fixed broadband substitution. As a result, we expect that our tenants will continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks.•Wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their existing networks, which is driven by capacity and coverage. To maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases, our tenants continue deploying additional equipment across their existing sites while also adding new cell sites. We anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years, as existing network infrastructure is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage. •Wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum, and as a result are expected to add additional sites and equipment to their networks as they seek to optimize their network configuration and utilize additional spectrum.•Next generation technologies requiring wireless connectivity have the potential to provide incremental revenue opportunities for us. These technologies may include autonomous vehicle networks and a number of other internet-of-things, or IoT, applications, as well as other potential use cases for wireless services. These technologies may create new and complementary use cases for our communications real estate over time, although these use cases are currently in nascent stages.As part of our international expansion initiatives, we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term. In addition, we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers to increase the opportunities for growth or mutually beneficial transactional opportunities across common markets. We believe that consistent carrier network investments across our international markets will, over the long term, position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward.In emerging markets, such as Burkina Faso, Ghana, India, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria and Uganda, wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the United States, and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in certain underdeveloped areas. A majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services, predominantly on feature phones, while advanced device penetration remains low. In more developed urban locations within these markets, data network deployments are underway. Carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while also investing in initial data networks as mobile data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate. In India, the ongoing transition from 2G technology to 4G technology has included a period of carrier consolidation, whereby the number of carriers operating in the marketplace has been reduced through mergers, acquisitions and select carrier exits from the marketplace, which we believe is now substantially complete. We believe that this consolidation process has resulted in an industry structure for both the wireless carriers and communications infrastructure providers that is expected to be more conducive to sustained growth and profitability over time. In markets with rapidly evolving network technology, such as South Africa and most of the countries in Latin America where we do business, initial voice networks, for the most part, have already been built out, and carriers are increasingly focused on 4G network build outs, with certain continuing legacy investments in 3G. Consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices, in particular as lower cost smartphones become increasingly available. As a result, the usage of bandwidth-intensive mobile applications is growing materially. Recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks. Smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are advancing rapidly, which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks to maintain and augment their quality of service.25Table of ContentsFinally, in markets with more mature network technology, such as Germany and France, carriers are focused on deploying 4G data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their customer base. With higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage, carrier investment in networks is focused on 4G coverage and capacity.We believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the United States, which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years, will be replicated in our less advanced international markets over time. As a result, we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 138,545 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier tenants to drive sustainable, long-term growth.We have master lease agreements with certain of our tenants that provide for consistent, long-term revenue and reduce the likelihood of churn. Certain of those master lease agreements are holistic in nature and further build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced colocation cycle times, thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites.Demand for our communications sites could be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including an increase in network sharing or consolidation among our tenants, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the captions “Risk Factors—If our tenants consolidate their operations, exit the telecommunications business or share site infrastructure to a significant degree, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected” and “Risk Factors—A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants.” In addition, the emergence and growth of new technologies could reduce demand for our sites, as set forth under the caption “Risk Factors—New technologies or changes in our or a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results.” Further, our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites.Property Operations New Site Revenue Growth. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 13,705 sites globally. In a majority of our Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America markets, the revenue generated from newly acquired or constructed sites resulted in increases in both tenant and pass-through revenues (such as ground rent or power and fuel costs) and expenses. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios, both domestically and internationally, to determine whether they meet our risk-adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio.New Sites (Acquired or Constructed)2019 2018 2017U.S.430 285 635Asia3,330 21,470 1,135Africa6,455 1,040 265Europe15 15 2,490Latin America3,475 1,655 2,360Property Operations Expenses. Direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes, repairs and maintenance. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled Selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our property segments’ selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our sites and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new tenants on our sites provides significant incremental cash flow. We may, however, incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our sites but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities.Services Segment Revenue Growth. As we continue to focus on growing our property operations, we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. Non-GAAP Financial Measures26Table of ContentsIncluded in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (“Adjusted EBITDA”), Funds From Operations, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit FFO”) attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations (“Consolidated AFFO”) and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders.We define Adjusted EBITDA as Net income before Income (loss) from equity method investments; Income tax benefit (provision); Other income (expense); Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; Interest expense; Interest income; Other operating income (expense); Depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense. Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interests. In this section, we refer to Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “Nareit FFO (common stockholders).” We define Consolidated AFFO as Nareit FFO (common stockholders) before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) the deferred portion of income tax; (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion; (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges; (vi) other income (expense); (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; (viii) other operating income (expense); and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interests, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures. We define AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as Consolidated AFFO, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both Nareit FFO (common stockholders) and the other adjustments included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. In this section, we refer to AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “AFFO (common stockholders).” Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. None of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO or AFFO (common stockholders) represents cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or a measure of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for decision making purposes and for evaluating our operating segments’ performance; (2) Adjusted EBITDA is a component underlying our credit ratings; (3) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4) Consolidated AFFO is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to adjust Nareit FFO (common stockholders) for items that may otherwise cause material fluctuations in Nareit FFO (common stockholders) growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of property assets in those periods; (5) each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (6) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies, particularly those in our industry.Our measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included below.27Table of ContentsResults of OperationsYears Ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in millions, except percentages) Revenue Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2019 vs 2018 Percent Change 2018 vs 2017 2019 2018 2017 Property U.S.$4,188.7 $3,822.1 $3,605.7 10 % 6%Asia1,217.0 1,540.5 1,164.4 (21) 32Africa583.9 545.5 503.6 7 8Europe134.6 141.8 122.6 (5) 16Latin America1,340.7 1,264.8 1,169.6 6 8Total property7,464.9 7,314.7 6,565.9 2 11Services115.4 125.4 98.0 (8) 28Total revenues$7,580.3 $7,440.1 $6,663.9 2 % 12%Year ended December 31, 2019 U.S. property segment revenue growth of $366.6 million was attributable to: • Tenant billings growth of $276.5 million, which was driven by:•$206.1 million due to colocations and amendments; •$62.6 million from contractual escalations, net of churn; and•$14.2 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites; •Partially offset by a decrease of $6.4 million from other tenant billings; and• An increase of $90.1 million in other revenue, which includes an $82.4 million increase due to straight-line accounting primarily due to entry into a new master lease agreement with one of our tenants, AT&T.Asia property segment revenue decrease of $323.5 million was attributable to:• A decrease of $266.8 million in other revenue, primarily due to the net impact of $333.7 million related to the October 2018 settlement with Tata Teleservices Limited (“Tata Teleservices”) and related entities (collectively, “Tata”);• A decrease in tenant billings of $68.0 million, which was driven by:•A decrease of $219.4 million resulting from churn in excess of contractual escalations, including $209.8 million of carrier consolidation-driven churn in India;•Partially offset by:▪$75.6 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites, including $59.5 million from the transactions with Vodafone India Limited and Vodafone Mobile Services Limited (together, “Vodafone” and the transaction, the “Vodafone Acquisition”) and Idea Cellular Limited (“Idea” and the transaction, the “Idea Acquisition”);▪$74.0 million due to colocations and amendments; and▪$1.8 million from other tenant billings; and• Pass-through revenue growth of $51.8 million.Segment revenue decline includes a decrease of $40.5 million attributable to the negative impact of foreign currency translation related to fluctuations in Indian Rupee (“INR”).Africa property segment revenue growth of $38.4 million was attributable to:• Tenant billings growth of $56.8 million, which was driven by: •$21.7 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites, primarily due to the acquisition of communications sites in Kenya in the fourth quarter of 2018 (the “Kenya Acquisition”); •$14.1 million due to colocations and amendments; •$14.1 million from contractual escalations, net of churn; and•$6.9 million from other tenant billings;28Table of Contents• Pass-through revenue growth of $13.8 million; and• A decrease of $0.8 million in other revenue.

The impairment charges included $258.3 million related to tower and network intangible assets and $107.3 million related to tenant relationships in our Asia property segment due to the settlement with Tata, Aircel Ltd.’s (“Aircel”) filing for bankruptcy protection and other carrier consolidation-driven churn in India. The increase was also attributable to the nonrecurrence of a $22.2 million refund of acquisition costs recorded in the prior-year period related to an acquisition in Brazil, partially offset by $10.0 million to fund our charitable foundation in the 2017.

We record unrealized foreign currency gains or losses as a result of foreign currency fluctuations primarily associated with our intercompany notes and similar unaffiliated balances denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies.The increase in total other expense during the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to (i) a decrease in other income of $16.8 million, primarily due to the nonrecurrence of a gain of $9.7 million associated with the write-offs of the capital lease liability and Economic Rights Agreement and related amortization in conjunction with the note extinguishment with TV Azteca during the year ended December 31, 2018 and (ii) an increase in loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $18.9 million primarily due to a loss of $22.1 million, attributable to the repayment of the 5.050% senior unsecured notes due 2020 (the “5.050% Notes”). These items were partially offset by foreign currency gains of $6.1 million in the current period, compared to foreign currency losses of $4.5 million in the prior-year period and a decrease in net interest expense of $3.4 million.The increase in total other expense during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to additional interest expense of $75.9 million due to a $2.0 billion increase in our average debt outstanding and foreign currency losses of $4.5 million in the current period, compared to foreign currency gains of $26.4 million in the prior-year period. The increase was partially offset by (i) a decrease in loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $66.9 million due to the nonrecurrence of a loss of $70.2 million recorded in the prior-year period attributable to the redemptions of the 7.25% senior unsecured notes due 2019 and the 4.500% senior unsecured notes due 2018 and the repayment of the Secured Cellular Site Revenue Notes, Series 2012-2 Class A, Series 2012-2 Class B and Series 2012-2 Class C and Secured Cellular Site Revenue Notes, Series 2010-2, Class C and Series 2010-2, Class F, (ii) an increase in other income of $23.4 million partially due to the write-offs of the capital lease liability and Economic Rights Agreement and related amortization in conjunction with the note extinguishment with TV Azteca and (iii) an additional $19.3 million in interest income, compared to the prior-year period.Income Tax (Benefit) Provision Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2019 vs 2018 Percent Change 2018 vs 2017 2019 2018 2017 Income tax (benefit) provision $(0.2) $(110.1) $30.7 (100)% (459)%Effective tax rate (0.0)% (9.5)% 2.4% As a REIT, we may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated by our REIT operations. In addition, we are able to offset certain income by utilizing our NOLs, subject to specified limitations. Consequently, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 differs from the federal statutory rate.The decrease in the income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in foreign earnings subject to taxation in the current period, offset by a $113.0 million benefit arising from revaluing our net deferred tax liability due to tax law changes in India. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was favorably impacted by certain events in India and a one-time benefit, discussed below. The change in the income tax (benefit) provision for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to a decrease in foreign earnings subject to taxation in the current period, primarily resulting from impairment charges and accelerated amortization in India, and a one-time benefit of $85.7 million related to the restructuring of international operations 34Table of Contentsin certain jurisdictions.

Year Ended December 31, 2018 The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in our operating profit, the change in the income tax (benefit) provision and the nonrecurrence of a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $70.2 million recorded in the prior-year period, partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses, primarily related to an increase in impairment charges of $182.6 million, and increases in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense and interest expense.The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin, partially offset by an increase in SG&A of $67.6 million, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense.The growth in Consolidated AFFO and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders was primarily attributable to the increase in our operating profit, a decrease in dividends on preferred stock and a decrease in the adjustment for straight-line revenue, partially offset by increases in cash paid for interest, capital improvement capital expenditures and corporate SG&A. 37Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital Resources Overview During the year ended December 31, 2019, we increased our financial flexibility and our ability to grow our business while maintaining our long-term financial policies. Our significant 2019 financing transactions included:•Unsecured $1.3 billion term loan due February 13, 2020 (the “2019 364-Day Term Loan”). •Registered public offerings in an aggregate amount of $4.9 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturities ranging from 2024 to 2049.•Redemptions of the 3.40% senior unsecured notes due 2019 (the “3.40% Notes”) and the 5.050% Notes for an aggregate amount of $1.7 billion.•Amendment and restatements of our multicurrency senior unsecured revolving credit facility entered into in June 2013, as amended (as amended and restated, the “2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility”), our senior unsecured revolving credit facility entered into in January 2012 and amended and restated in September 2014, as further amended (as amended and restated, the “2019 Credit Facility”) and our unsecured term loan entered into in October 2013, as amended (as amended and restated, the “2019 Term Loan”) to, among other things, (i) extend each of the maturity dates by one year to June 28, 2023, January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2025, respectively and (ii) increase the commitments under each of the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility and the 2019 Credit Facility to $3.0 billion and $2.25 billion, respectively.The following table summarizes our liquidity as of December 31, 2019 (in millions): Available under the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility$2,300.0Available under the 2019 Credit Facility650.0Letters of credit(9.9)Total available under credit facilities, net2,940.1Cash and cash equivalents1,501.2Total liquidity$4,441.3Subsequent to December 31, 2019, we made net repayments of $600.0 million under the 2019 Credit Facility, including repayments of approximately $1,483.4 million using the proceeds from our issuance of the 2.400% Notes and 2.900% Notes (each as defined below), and made net borrowings of $271.8 million under the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility. The borrowings were used to repay existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. Summary cash flow information is set forth below for the years ended December 31, (in millions): 2019 2018 2017Net cash provided by (used for): Operating activities$3,752.6 $3,748.3 $2,925.6Investing activities(3,987.5) (2,749.5) (2,800.9)Financing activities521.7 (607.7) (113.0)Net effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash(13.7) (41.1) 6.7Net increase in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash$273.1 $350.0 $18.4We use our cash flows to fund our operations and investments in our business, including tower maintenance and improvements, communications site construction and managed network installations and tower and land acquisitions. Additionally, we use our cash flows to make distributions, including distributions of our REIT taxable income to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We may also repay or repurchase our existing indebtedness or equity from time to time. We typically fund our international expansion efforts primarily through a combination of cash on hand, intercompany debt and equity contributions. In April 2019, Tata Teleservices and Tata Sons Limited, two of our minority holders in India, delivered notice of exercise of their put options with respect to their remaining combined holdings in our Indian subsidiary, ATC TIPL (see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Accordingly, we expect to pay an amount equivalent to INR 24.8 billion (approximately $347.6 million at the December 31, 2019 exchange rate) to redeem the put shares in the first half of 2020, subject to regulatory approval. In connection with the closing of the Eaton Towers Acquisition (see note 7 to our 38Table of Contentsconsolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report), we entered into an agreement with MTN to acquire MTN’s noncontrolling interests in each of our joint ventures in Ghana and Uganda for total consideration of approximately $523.0 million. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions.As of December 31, 2019, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $24.2 billion, with a current portion of $2.9 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and debt service obligations, as well as our required distributions. We believe the cash generated by operating activities during the year ending December 31, 2020, together with our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and cash on hand, will be sufficient to fund our required distributions, capital expenditures, debt service obligations (interest and principal repayments) and signed acquisitions. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $583.0 million was held by our joint ventures. While certain subsidiaries may pay us interest or principal on intercompany debt, it has not been our practice to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs. However, in the event that we do repatriate any funds, we may be required to accrue and pay certain taxes. Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesFor the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by operating activities increased $4.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.

The 2019 364-Day Term Loan matured on February 13, 2020 and had an interest rate that ranged between 0.550% and 1.375% above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or up to 0.375% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based upon our debt ratings. On the February 13, 2020 maturity date, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the 2019 364-Day Term Loan with proceeds from the 2020 Term Loan (as defined below), borrowings from the 2019 Credit Facility and cash on hand.As of December 31, 2019, the key terms under the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2019 Credit Facility, the 2019 Term Loan and the 2019 364-Day Term Loan were as follows: Bank Facility (1)Outstanding Principal BalanceMaturity Date LIBOR borrowing interest rate range (2)Base rate borrowing interest rate range (2)Current margin over LIBOR and the base rate, respectively2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility$700.0June 28, 2023(3)0.875% - 1.750%0.000% - 0.750%1.125% and 0.125%2019 Credit Facility$1,600.0January 31, 2025(3)0.875% - 1.750%0.000% - 0.750%1.125% and 0.125%2019 Term Loan$1,000.0January 31, 2025 0.875% - 1.750%0.000% - 0.750%1.125% and 0.125%2019 364-Day Term Loan$1,000.0February 13, 2020 0.550% - 1.375%0.000% - 0.375%0.800% and 0.000%_______________(1) Currently borrowed at LIBOR.(2)Represents interest rate above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings and the interest rate above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on our debt ratings.(3)Subject to two optional renewal periods. The 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility and the 2019 Credit Facility are subject to two optional renewal periods and we must pay a quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of each facility. The commitment fee for each of the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility and the 2019 Credit Facility ranges from 0.080% to 0.300% per annum, based upon our debt ratings, and is currently 0.110%.2020 Term Loan—On February 13, 2020, we entered into a $750.0 million unsecured term loan (the “2020 Term Loan”), the net proceeds of which were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the 2019 364-Day Term Loan. The 2020 Term Loan matures on February 12, 2021 and has an interest rate that is 0.65% above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or 0.00% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity.The 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2019 Credit Facility, the 2019 Term Loan and the 2020 Term Loan do not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. We have the option of choosing either a defined base rate or the LIBOR as the applicable base rate for borrowings under these bank facilities.The loan agreements for each of the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2019 Credit Facility, the 2019 Term Loan and the 2020 Term Loan contain certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply. Failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreements could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facilities, but may constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable.India Indebtedness—During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repaid all remaining debt assumed in connection with the Viom Acquisition and debt entered into by ATC TIPL. The remaining India indebtedness includes several working capital facilities, most of which are subject to annual renewal. The working capital facilities bear interest at rates that consist of the applicable bank’s Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (as defined in the applicable agreement), plus a spread. 43Table of ContentsGenerally, the working capital facilities are payable on demand prior to maturity. Amounts outstanding and key terms of the India indebtedness consisted of the following as of December 31, 2019 (in millions, except percentages): Amount Outstanding (INR) Amount Outstanding (USD) Interest Rate (Range) Maturity Date (Range)Working capital facilities (1) — $— 8.15% - 8.75% March 18, 2020 - October 23, 2020_______(1) 5.6 billion INR ($78.9 million) of borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2019. Stock Repurchase Programs—We have two stock repurchase programs, the 2011 Buyback and the 2017 Buyback. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased 93,654 shares of our common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $19.6 million, including commissions and fees. We had no repurchases under the 2017 Buyback.Under each program, we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions not to exceed market prices and subject to market conditions and other factors. With respect to open market purchases, we may use plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements, which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. These programs may be discontinued at any time.We expect to continue managing the pacing of the remaining $2.1 billion under the Buyback Programs in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors. We expect to fund further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Purchases under the Buyback Programs are subject to us having available cash to fund repurchases. Sales of Equity Securities—We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plan. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we received an aggregate of $105.5 million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and sales pursuant to the ESPP.Distributions—As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we have distributed, and expect to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income after taking into consideration our utilization of NOLs. We have distributed an aggregate of approximately $7.4 billion to our common stockholders, including the dividend paid in January 2020, primarily classified as ordinary income that may be treated as qualified REIT dividends under Section 199A of the Code for taxable years ending after 2017 and before 2026. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.During the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid $3.61 per share, or $1.6 billion, to common stockholders of record. In addition, we declared a distribution of $1.01 per share, or $447.3 million, paid on January 14, 2020 to our common stockholders of record at the close of business on December 27, 2019.We accrue distributions on unvested restricted stock units, which are payable upon vesting. The amount accrued for distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units was $14.3 million and $13.7 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid $7.0 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units. For more details on the cash distributions paid to our common stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2019, see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.44Table of ContentsContractual Obligations—The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in millions):Contractual Obligations2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Thereafter TotalLong-term debt, including current portion: American Tower Corporation debt: 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility $— $— $— $700.0 $— $— $700.0 2019 Term Loan — — — — — 1,000.0 1,000.0 2019 Credit Facility — — — — — 1,600.0 1,600.0 2019 364-Day Term Loan (1)1,000.0 — — — — — 1,000.0 2.800% senior notes750.0 — — — — — 750.0 3.300% senior notes— 750.0 — — — — 750.0 3.450% senior notes— 650.0 — — — — 650.0 5.900% senior notes (2)500.0 — — — — — 500.0 2.250% senior notes— — 600.0 — — — 600.0 4.70% senior notes— — 700.0 — — — 700.0 3.50% senior notes— — — 1,000.0 — — 1,000.0 3.000% senior notes— — — 700.0 — — 700.0 5.00% senior notes— — — — 1,000.0 — 1,000.0 3.375% senior notes— — — — 650.0 — 650.0 1.375% senior notes— — — — — 560.6 560.6 2.950% senior notes— — — — — 650.0 650.0 3.375% senior notes— — — — — 1,000.0 1,000.0 4.000% senior notes— — — — — 750.0 750.0 4.400% senior notes— — — — — 500.0 500.0 1.950% senior notes— — — — — 560.6 560.6 3.125% senior notes— — — — — 400.0 400.0 2.750% senior notes— — — — — 750.0 750.0 3.55% senior notes— — — — — 750.0 750.0 3.600% senior notes— — — — — 700.0 700.0 3.950% senior notes— — — — — 600.0 600.0 3.800% senior notes— — — — — 1,650.0 1,650.0 3.700% senior notes— — — — — 600.0 600.0Total American Tower Corporation debt2,250.0 1,400.0 1,300.0 2,400.0 1,650.0 12,071.2 21,071.2 American Tower subsidiary debt: Series 2013-2A securities (3)— — — 1,300.0 — — 1,300.0 Series 2018-1A securities (3)— — — — — 500.0 500.0 Series 2015-1 notes (4)350.0 — — — — — 350.0 Series 2015-2 notes (5)— — — — — 525.0 525.0 Other subsidiary debt (6)323.8 42.4 35.8 20.8 — — 422.8Total American Tower subsidiary debt673.842.435.81,320.8—1,025.03,097.8Long-term obligations, excluding finance leases2,923.81,442.4 1,335.8 3,720.8 1,650.0 13,096.2 24,169.0Cash interest expense807.0 752.4 663.3 563.3 475.4 1,343.1 4,604.5Finance lease payments (including interest)8.0 5.3 4.3 3.0 2.1 45.4 68.1Total debt service obligations3,738.8 2,200.1 2,003.4 4,287.1 2,127.5 14,484.7 28,841.6Operating lease payments (7)904.3 878.3 845.5 810.3 766.4 6,140.1 10,344.9Other non-current liabilities (8)(9)6.6 9.0 20.1 14.3 8.0 3,371.9 3,429.9Total$4,649.7 $3,087.4 $2,869.0 $5,111.7 $2,901.9 $23,996.7 $42,616.4_______________(1)Repaid in full on February 13, 2020.

Subsequent to December 31, 2019, we repaid all of the outstanding Eaton Towers USD denominated and KES denominated debt. (7)Includes payments under non-cancellable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option, which we expect to renew because failure to do so could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases.(8)Primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other non-current liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily unearned revenue that is not payable in cash. (9)Excludes $126.3 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and $26.6 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled. Settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe. However, based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements, we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements—We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.Factors Affecting Sources of LiquidityOur liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities, borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness. We believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants, our compliance with which would be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity.Internally Generated Funds—Because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2019 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities depends upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites.Restrictions Under Loan Agreements Relating to Our Credit Facilities—The loan agreements for the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2019 Credit Facility, the 2019 Term Loan and the 2020 Term Loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These restrictions include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage, as set forth in the table below. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. Compliance Tests For The 12 Months Ended December 31, 2019 ($ in billions) Ratio (1) Additional Debt Capacity Under Covenants (2) Capacity for Adjusted EBITDA Decrease Under Covenants (3)Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 6.00:1.00 ~$5.8 ~$1.0Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio Senior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 3.00:1.00 ~$11.7 (4) ~$3.9_______________(1) Each component of the ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement.(2) Assumes no change to Adjusted EBITDA.(3) Assumes no change to our debt levels. (4) Effectively, however, additional Senior Secured Debt under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio.The loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants.Failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but may constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand 46Table of Contentsto repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants.Restrictions Under Agreements Relating to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations—The indenture and related supplemental indentures governing the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1, Class A (the “Series 2015-1 Notes”) and the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the “Series 2015-2 Notes,” and, together with the Series 2015-1 Notes, the “2015 Notes”) issued by GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC (“GTP Acquisition Partners”) in the 2015 Securitization and the loan agreement related to Trust Securitizations, as discussed further in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, GTP Acquisition Partners and American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the “AMT Asset Subs”) are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets, subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the applicable agreement).Under the agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the 2015 Notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan made by the American Tower Trust I (the “Trust”) to the AMT Asset Subs (the “Loan”), as applicable, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement, subject to the conditions described in the table below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs, as applicable, which can then be distributed to, and used by, us. As of December 31, 2019, $63.1 million held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash. Certain information with respect to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations is set forth below. The debt service coverage ratio (“DSCR”) is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination.

During a Cash Trap DSCR condition, all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account (the “Cash Trap Reserve Account”) instead of being released to the applicable issuer or borrower. (3)An amortization period commences if the DSCR is equal to or below 1.15x (the “Minimum DSCR”) at the end of any calendar quarter and continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. (4)No amortization period is triggered if the outstanding principal amount of a series has not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date. However, in such event, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the applicable series, and such series will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow.(5)An amortization period exists if the outstanding principal amount has not been paid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date and continues to exist until such principal has been repaid in full. A failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions and meet REIT distribution requirements. During an “amortization period,” all excess cash flow and any amounts in the applicable Cash Trap Reserve Account would be applied to pay principal of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, on each monthly payment date, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Further, additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any series of the 2015 Notes or subclass of the Loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement. With respect to the 2015 Notes, upon the occurrence and during an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of the 2015 Notes, declare such series of 2015 Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes. Furthermore, if GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs were to default on a series of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 3,542 communications sites that secure the 2015 Notes or the 5,114 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets that secure the Loan, respectively, in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assets.As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our distribution requirements and repay or repurchase our debt. If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and debt service obligations or refinance our existing indebtedness. In addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and, consequently, a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2019. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.•Impairment of Assets—Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization: We review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable. 48Table of ContentsWe review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements.We review our tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenant-related intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. Key assumptions included in the undiscounted cash flows are future revenue projections, estimates of ongoing tenancies and operating margins. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment.In October 2019, the Indian Supreme Court issued a ruling regarding the definition of AGR and associated fees and charges that may have a material financial impact on certain of our tenants which could affect their ability to perform their obligations under agreements with us. We will continue to monitor the status of these developments, as it is possible that the estimated future cash flows may differ from current estimates and changes in estimated cash flows from tenants in India could have an impact on previously recorded tangible and intangible assets, including amounts originally recorded as tenant-related intangibles. The carrying value of tenant-related intangibles in India was $1,124.4 million as of December 31, 2019, which represents 12% of our consolidated balance of $8,999.5 million. Additionally, a significant reduction in tenant related cash flows in India could also impact our tower portfolio and network location intangibles. The carrying values of our tower portfolio and network location intangibles in India were $1,064.8 million and $483.4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019, which represent 13% and 15% of our consolidated balances of $7,964.1 million and $3,230.4 million, respectively. •Impairment of Assets—Goodwill: We review goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.Goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. We utilize the two step impairment test and employ a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. Under the first step of this test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, we conduct the second step of this test, in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess.During the year ended December 31, 2019, no potential impairment was identified as the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount. The fair value of our India reporting unit, which is based on the present value of forecasted future value cash flows (the income approach) exceeded the carrying value by approximately 7%. Key assumptions include future revenue growth rates and operating margins, capital expenditures, terminal period growth rate and the weighted-average cost of capital, which were determined considering historical data and current assumptions related to the impacts of the carrier consolidation, each of which could be impacted by our tenants’ ability to perform their contractual obligations as a result of the AGR ruling or otherwise. For this reporting unit, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that a (i) less than 1% reduction of projected revenues, (ii) 42 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of capital or (iii) 17% reduction in terminal sales growth rate, individually, each of which we determined to be reasonable, would impact our conclusion that the fair value of the India reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. Events that could negatively affect our India reporting unit’s financial results include increased tenant attrition exceeding our forecast resulting from the ongoing carrier consolidation, carrier tenant bankruptcies and other factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors.” The carrying value of goodwill in the India reporting unit was $1,021.8 million as of December 31, 2019, which represents 17% of our consolidated balance of $6,178.3 million.•Asset Retirement Obligations: When required, we recognize the fair value of obligations to remove our tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of our tower assets are located. Generally, the associated retirement 49Table of Contentscosts are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. We updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net decrease in the estimated obligation of $66.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in 2019 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary.•Acquisitions: We evaluate each of our acquisitions under the accounting guidance framework to determine whether to treat an acquisition as an asset acquisition or a business combination. For those transactions treated as asset acquisitions, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired, with no recognition of goodwill. For those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, we apply the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with our results from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We continue to evaluate acquisitions accounted for as business combinations for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future tenant cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition. •Revenue Recognition: Our revenue is derived from leasing the right to use our communications sites and the land on which the sites are located (the “lease component”) and from the reimbursement of costs incurred in operating the communications sites and supporting the tenants’ equipment as well as other services and contractual rights (the “non-lease component”). Most of our revenue is derived from leasing arrangements and is accounted for as lease revenue unless the timing and pattern of revenue recognition of the non-lease component differs from the lease component. If the timing and pattern of the non-lease component revenue recognition differs from that of the lease component, we separately determine the stand-alone selling prices and pattern of revenue recognition for each performance obligation.Our revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is probable. Escalation clauses tied to a consumer price index or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants, are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total property straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $183.5 million, $87.6 million and $194.4 million, respectively. Amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable lease arrangements. Amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met.We derive the largest portion of our revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, with 54% of our revenues derived from four tenants. In addition, we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. We mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our borrowers and tenants. In recognizing tenant revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense. Accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated 50Table of Contentslosses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured.•Rent Expense and Lease Accounting: Many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time. In addition, certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. We calculate straight-line ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. Effective January 1, 2019, we adopted the new lease standard using the modified retrospective method applied to lease arrangements that were in place on the transition date. The new lease accounting guidance required us to recognize a right-of-use lease asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases. The right-of-use asset is measured as the sum of the lease liability, prepaid or accrued lease payments, any initial direct costs incurred and any other applicable amounts.The calculation of the lease liability requires us to make certain assumptions for each lease, including lease term and discount rate implicit in each lease, which could significantly impact the gross lease obligation, the duration and the present value of the lease liability. When calculating the lease term, we consider the renewal, cancellation and termination rights available to us and the lessor. We determine the discount rate by calculating the incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis at the commencement of a lease or upon a change in the lease term.•Income Taxes: Accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes. To the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes, deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns, which may differ from the current rate. We do not expect to pay federal income taxes on our REIT taxable income.We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes, if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability.We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination, which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit.Accounting Standards UpdateFor a discussion of recent accounting standards updates, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.51Table of ContentsITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe following table provides information as of December 31, 2019 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates.

(g) Represents the weighted average variable rate of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts.Interest Rate RiskAs of December 31, 2019, we have one interest rate swap agreement related to debt in Colombia. This swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge, has a notional amount of $18.3 million, has an interest rate of 5.37% and expires in April 2021. We also have three interest rate swap agreements related to the 2.250% Notes. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of $600.0 million, an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expire in January 2022. In addition, we have three interest rate swap agreements related to a portion of the 3.000% Notes. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of $500.0 million, an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expire in June 2023. Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2019 consisted of $700.0 million under the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility, $1.6 billion under the 2019 Credit Facility, $1.0 billion under the 2019 Term Loan, $1.0 billion under the 2019 364-Day Term Loan, $600.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 2.250% Notes, $500.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 3.000% Notes, $20.8 million under the South African credit facility, $6.1 million under the Colombian credit facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements, $16.3 million under the Brazil credit facility and $329.8 million under the Eaton Towers Debt. A 10% increase in current interest rates would result in an additional $20.8 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019. 52Table of ContentsForeign Currency RiskWe are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar is reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 43% of our revenues and 51% of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies.As of December 31, 2019, we have incurred intercompany debt that is not considered to be permanently reinvested, and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As this debt had not been designated as being a long-term investment in nature, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. An adverse change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in $105.4 million of unrealized losses that would be included in Other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019.",2023-12-30 19:23:17.082331
1053507,AMT,AMERICAN TOWER CORP /MA/,2021,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the accompanying notes, and the information set forth under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” below. During the fourth quarter of 2020, as a result of the InSite Acquisition, we updated our reportable segments to rename U.S. property and Asia property to U.S. & Canada property and Asia-Pacific property, respectively. We continue to report our results in six segments – U.S. & Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property and 21Table of Contents services. This change was made to better align the names of our reportable segments with the geographical areas of our business operations following the InSite Acquisition. The change of our reportable segments names is solely reflective of the inclusion of Canada and Australia in our business operations, as a result of the InSite Acquisition, and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any prior periods. Historical financial information included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations has not been adjusted.In evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses, among other factors, segment gross margin and segment operating profit (see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Executive OverviewWe are one of the largest global REITs and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. We refer to the business encompassing the above as our property operations, which accounted for 99% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 and includes our U.S. & Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property and Latin America property segments. We also offer tower-related services in the United States, including site application, zoning and permitting and structural analysis, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. 22Table of Contents The following table details the number of communications sites, excluding managed sites, that we owned or operated as of December 31, 2020: Number ofOwned TowersNumber ofOperated Towers (1)Number ofOwned DAS SitesU.S. & Canada:Canada (2)208 — — United States27,058 15,432 448 U.S. & Canada total27,266 15,432 448 Asia-Pacific: (2)India74,732 — 1,040 Asia-Pacific total74,732 — 1,040 Africa:Burkina Faso707 — — Ghana3,298 663 28 Kenya2,397 — 9 Niger720 — — Nigeria5,823 — — South Africa2,831 — — Uganda3,375 — 12 Africa total19,151 663 49 Europe:France2,769 309 9 Germany2,217 — — Poland 27 — — Europe total5,013 309 9 Latin America:Argentina119 — 10 Brazil16,792 2,249 104 Chile3,005 — 23 Colombia4,992 — 4 Costa Rica661 — 2 Mexico9,500 186 92 Paraguay1,426 — — Peru1,935 429 — Latin America total38,430 2,864 235 _______________(1)Approximately 95% of the operated towers are held pursuant to long-term finance leases, including those subject to purchase options. (2)In December 2020, we launched operations in Canada and Australia through the InSite Acquisition. In Australia, we do not own or operate communications sites but control land under carrier or other third-party communications sites, which provides recurring cash flow through tenant leasing arrangements. In Canada, we also control land under carrier or other third-party communications sites.On January 13, 2021, we signed agreements for the Pending Telxius Acquisition, pursuant to which we expect to acquire approximately 31,000 communications sites in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Peru and Spain, for approximately 7.7 billion EUR (approximately $9.4 billion at the time of signing) at closing, subject to certain conditions and limited adjustments. The Pending Telxius Acquisition is expected to close in multiple tranches, beginning in the second quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including government and regulatory approval. The impact of the Pending Telxius Acquisition on our 2021 results of operations will be dependent on a number of factors, including the timing of any closings.In most of our markets, our tenant leases with wireless carriers generally have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. Accordingly, the vast majority of the revenue generated by our property operations during the year ended December 31, 2020 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Based upon existing tenant leases and foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2020, we expect to generate nearly $59 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting. Most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically based on an annual fixed escalation (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or a combination of both. In addition, certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs. 23Table of Contents The revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts, which typically are non-cancellable; however, in some instances, a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee.Revenue lost from either tenant lease cancellations or the non-renewal of leases or rent renegotiations, which we refer to as churn, has historically not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our consolidated property operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, churn was approximately 3% of our tenant billings. Beginning in late 2017, we experienced an increase in revenue lost from cancellations or non-renewals primarily due to carrier consolidation-driven churn in India, which compressed our gross margin and operating profit, particularly in our Asia-Pacific property segment, although this impact was partially offset by lower expenses due to reduced tenancy on existing sites and the decommissioning of certain sites. For the year ended December 31, 2020, aggregate carrier consolidation in India did not have a material impact on our consolidated property revenue, gross margin or operating profit, although overall churn rates in India remained elevated relative to historical levels.We anticipate that our churn rate in India will moderate over time and result in reduced impacts on our property revenue, gross margin and operating profit. In the immediate term, we believe that our churn rate may remain elevated as our tenants in India evaluate the recent court rulings by the Indian Supreme Court and determine their payment plans for the AGR fees and charges prescribed by such court, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors—Our business, and that of our tenants, is subject to laws, regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, and changes thereto, that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape.” We expect to periodically evaluate the carrying value of our Indian assets, which may result in the realization of additional impairment expense or other similar charges. For more information, please see the information under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.”Additionally, we expect that our churn rate in our U.S. & Canada property segment will be elevated for a period of several years due to contractual lease cancellations and non-renewals by T-Mobile, including legacy Sprint Corporation leases, pursuant to the terms of the T-Mobile MLA signed in September 2020.As further set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the captions “Risk Factors,” the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the response to mitigate its spread and effects, may adversely impact us and our tenants and the demand for our communications sites in the United States and globally. We have taken a variety of actions to ensure the continued availability of our communications sites, while ensuring the safety and security of our employees, tenants, vendors and surrounding communities. These measures include providing support for our tenants remotely, requiring work-from-home arrangements and restricting travel for our employees where practicable and other modifications to our business practices. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions as may be required by governmental authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, tenants and business partners.As a result of the impact of COVID-19 on global financial markets, foreign currency exchange rates have been volatile in many of the markets in which we operate. We estimate that the adverse impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our consolidated revenue and operating profit in the current period, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, was approximately $315 million and $172 million, respectively. If exchange rates become significantly more unfavorable, the impact to our revenue and other future operating results could be material. Additionally, the impact of COVID-19 on our operational results in subsequent periods will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted at this time. These developments may include, but are not limited to, new information concerning the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the degree of success of actions taken to contain or treat COVID-19, including the availability and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, and the reactions by consumers, companies, governmental entities and capital markets to such actions.Property Operations Revenue Growth. Due to our diversified communications site portfolio, our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. We measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. In many instances, tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation capital expenditures, which are often reimbursed to us.The primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our property segments are:•Growth in tenant billings, including:•New revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our sites (“colocations”) and lease amendments; •Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of churn; and24Table of Contents •New revenue attributable to leases in place on day one on sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior-year period.•Revenue growth from other items, including additional tenant payments primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs included in certain tenant leases (“pass-through”), straight-line revenue and decommissioning.We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services globally and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our communications real estate. By adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, we are able to increase these sites’ utilization and profitability. We believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers, with tenants in a number of other industries contributing incremental leasing demand. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks, while also deploying next generation wireless technologies. In addition, we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk-adjusted return on investment objectives. Property Operations Organic Revenue Growth. Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment from our sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers and other tenants deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless services, the penetration of advanced wireless devices, the level of emphasis on network quality and capacity in carrier competition, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions. According to industry data, recent aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the United States has averaged at least $30 billion, resulting in consistent demand for our sites. Based on industry research and projections, we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us:•In less advanced wireless markets where network deployments are in earlier stages, we expect these deployments to drive demand for our tower space as carriers seek to expand their footprints and increase the scope and density of their networks. We have established operations in many of these markets at the early stages of wireless development, which we believe will enable us to meaningfully participate in these deployments over the long term.•Subscribers’ use of mobile data continues to grow rapidly given increasing smartphone and other advanced device penetration, the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications on these devices and the continuing evolution of the mobile ecosystem. We believe carriers will be compelled to deploy additional equipment on existing networks while also rolling out more advanced wireless networks to address coverage and capacity needs resulting from this increasing mobile data usage.•The deployment of advanced mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G, will provide higher speed data services and further enable fixed broadband substitution. As a result, we expect that our tenants will continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks.•Wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their networks, which is driven by capacity and coverage. To maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases, our tenants continue to deploy additional equipment across their existing sites while also adding new cell sites. We anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years, as existing network density is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage. •Wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum, and as a result are expected to add additional sites and equipment to their networks as they seek to optimize their network configuration and utilize additional spectrum. We expect this to be particularly relevant in the context of higher-band spectrum such as 2.5 gigahertz (GHz) and C-Band being deployed for 5G, as these spectrum assets tend to have more limited propagation characteristics compared to the lower-band spectrum that has historically been deployed on our towers.•Next generation technologies requiring wireless connectivity have the potential to provide incremental revenue opportunities for us. These technologies may include edge computing functionality, autonomous vehicle networks and a number of other internet-of-things, or IoT, applications, as well as other potential use cases for wireless services. These technologies may create new and complementary use cases for our communications real estate over time, although these use cases are currently in nascent stages.As part of our international expansion initiatives, we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term. For example, as part of our Pending Telxius Acquisition, we expect to increase our exposure to more developed markets in Europe. In addition, we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers to increase the opportunities for growth or mutually beneficial transactional opportunities across common markets. We believe that consistent 25Table of Contents carrier network investments across our international markets will, over the long term, position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward.In emerging markets, such as Burkina Faso, Ghana, India, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria and Uganda, wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the United States, and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in certain underdeveloped areas. A majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services and advanced device penetration remains low. In more developed urban locations within these markets, mobile data usage tends to be higher and advanced network deployments are further along. Carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while increasing investments in data networks as mobile data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate. In India, the ongoing transition from 2G technology to 4G technology has included a period of carrier consolidation, whereby the number of carriers operating in the marketplace has been reduced through mergers, acquisitions and select carrier exits from the marketplace, which we believe is now substantially complete. We believe that this consolidation process has resulted in an industry structure for both the wireless carriers and communications infrastructure providers that will be more conducive to sustained growth and profitability over time. In markets with rapidly evolving network technology, such as South Africa, Poland and most of the countries in Latin America where we do business, initial voice networks, for the most part, have already been built out, and carriers are increasingly focused on 4G network deployments. Consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices, in particular as lower cost smartphones become increasingly available. As a result, the usage of bandwidth-intensive mobile applications is growing materially. Recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks. Smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are advancing rapidly, which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks to maintain and augment their quality of service.Finally, in markets with more mature network technology, such as Australia, Canada, Germany, France and, following the expected closing of our Pending Telxius Acquisition, Spain, carriers are focused on deploying 4G data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their customer base. With higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage, carrier investment in networks is focused on 4G coverage and capacity, as well as the early stages of 5G deployment.We believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the United States, which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years, will be replicated in our international markets over time. As a result, we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 143,000 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier tenants to drive sustainable, long-term growth.We have master lease agreements with many of our tenants that provide for consistent, long-term revenue and reduce the likelihood of non-contractual churn. Certain of those master lease agreements are comprehensive in nature and further build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants while significantly reducing colocation cycle times, thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites.Demand for our communications sites could be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including an increase in network sharing or consolidation among our tenants, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the captions “Risk Factors—If our tenants consolidate their operations, exit the telecommunications business or share site infrastructure to a significant degree, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected” and “Risk Factors—A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants.” In addition, the emergence and growth of new technologies could reduce demand for our sites, as set forth under the caption “Risk Factors—New technologies or changes in our or a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results.” Further, our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites.Property Operations New Site Revenue Growth. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 9,365 sites globally. In a majority of our Asia-Pacific, Africa, Europe and Latin America markets, the revenue generated from newly acquired or constructed sites resulted in increases in both tenant and pass-through revenues (such as ground rent or power and fuel costs) and expenses. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios, both domestically and internationally, to determine whether they meet our risk-adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio.26Table of Contents New Sites (Acquired or Constructed)202020192018U.S. & Canada2,255 430 285 Asia-Pacific3,960 3,330 21,470 Africa1,540 6,455 1,040 Europe610 15 15 Latin America1,000 3,475 1,655 Property Operations Expenses. Direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes and repairs and maintenance expenses. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled Selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our property segments’ selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our sites and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new tenants on our sites provides significant incremental gross margin and cash flow. We may, however, incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our sites but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities.Services Segment Revenue Growth. As we continue to focus on growing our property operations, we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIncluded in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (“Adjusted EBITDA”), Funds From Operations, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit FFO”) attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations (“Consolidated AFFO”) and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders.We define Adjusted EBITDA as Net income before Income (loss) from equity method investments; Income tax benefit (provision); Other income (expense); Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; Interest expense; Interest income; Other operating income (expense); Depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense. Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interests. In this section, we refer to Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “Nareit FFO (common stockholders).” We define Consolidated AFFO as Nareit FFO (common stockholders) before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) the deferred portion of income tax; (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion; (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges; (vi) other income (expense); (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; (viii) other operating income (expense); and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interests, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures. We define AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as Consolidated AFFO, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both Nareit FFO (common stockholders) and the other adjustments included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. In this section, we refer to AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “AFFO (common stockholders).” Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. None of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO or AFFO (common stockholders) represents cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or a measure of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure 27Table of Contents used by our management team for decision making purposes and for evaluating our operating segments’ performance; (2) Adjusted EBITDA is a component underlying our credit ratings; (3) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4) Consolidated AFFO is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to adjust Nareit FFO (common stockholders) for items that may otherwise cause material fluctuations in Nareit FFO (common stockholders) growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of property assets in those periods; (5) each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (6) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies, particularly those in our industry.Our measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included below.28Table of Contents Results of OperationsYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018For a discussion of our 2019 Results of Operations, including a discussion of our financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, refer to Part I, Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020 (the “2019 Form 10-K”). During the fourth quarter of 2020, as a result of the InSite Acquisition, we updated our reportable segments to rename U.S. property and Asia property to U.S. & Canada property and Asia-Pacific property, respectively. The change of our reportable segments names is solely reflective of the inclusion of Canada and Australia in our business operations, as a result of the InSite Acquisition, and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any prior periods.

Additionally, we use our cash flows to make distributions, including distributions of our REIT taxable income to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We may also repay or repurchase our existing indebtedness or equity from time to time. We typically fund our international expansion efforts primarily through a combination of cash on hand, intercompany debt and equity contributions. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed the acquisition of MTN’s noncontrolling interests in each of our joint ventures in Ghana and Uganda for total consideration of approximately $524.4 million (see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report), which resulted in an increase in our controlling interests in such joint ventures from 51% to 100%. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we redeemed Tata Teleservices Limited and Tata Sons’ remaining combined holdings of ATC TIPL (see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report), for total consideration of INR 24.8 billion ($337.3 million at the date of redemption). As a result of the redemption, our controlling interest in ATC TIPL increased from 79% to 92% and the noncontrolling interest decreased from 21% to 8%.36Table of Contents In February 2021, we entered into an agreement with Macquarie SBI Infrastructure Investments Pte Limited and SBI Macquarie Infrastructure Trust, our remaining minority holders in ATC TIPL, to redeem 100% of their combined holdings in ATC TIPL (see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report) at a price of INR 175 per share, subject to certain adjustments. Accordingly, we expect to pay an amount equivalent to INR 12.9 billion (approximately $176.6 million) to redeem the shares in 2021, subject to regulatory approval. After the completion of the redemption, we will hold a 100% ownership interest in ATC TIPL.As of December 31, 2020, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $29.5 billion, with a current portion of $0.8 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations, together with borrowings under our credit facilities and cash on hand, to fund our capital expenditures and debt service obligations, as well as our required distributions. We believe the cash generated by operating activities during the year ending December 31, 2021, together with our increased borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, recently executed delayed draw term loans and bridge loan commitment, will be sufficient to fund our required distributions, capital expenditures, debt service obligations (interest and principal repayments) and signed acquisitions. Our material current and long term cash requirements are further described below. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $570.5 million was held by our joint ventures. While certain subsidiaries may pay us interest or principal on intercompany debt, it has not been our practice to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs. However, in the event that we do repatriate any funds, we may be required to accrue and pay certain taxes. Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities increased $128.8 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

These programs may be discontinued at any time.We have repurchased a total of 14.4 million shares of our common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $1.5 billion, including commissions and fees. We expect to continue managing the pacing of the remaining approximately $2.0 billion under the Buyback Programs in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors. We expect to fund any further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Repurchases under the Buyback Programs are subject to, among other things, us having available cash to fund the repurchases. Sales of Equity Securities—We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plan. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we received an aggregate of $98.1 million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and sales pursuant to the ESPP.2020 “At the Market” Stock Offering Program—In August 2020, we established the 2020 ATM Program. Sales under the 2020 ATM Program may be made by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or, subject to our specific instructions, at negotiated prices. We intend to use the net proceeds of the 2020 ATM Program for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, the funding of acquisitions, additions to working capital and repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, we have not sold any shares of common stock under the 2020 ATM Program.Distributions—As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we have distributed, and expect to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income after taking into consideration our utilization of NOLs. We have distributed an aggregate of approximately $9.4 billion to our common 43Table of Contents stockholders, including the dividend paid in February 2021, primarily classified as ordinary income that may be treated as qualified REIT dividends under Section 199A of the Code for taxable years ending before 2026. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.During the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid $4.33 per share, or $1.9 billion, to common stockholders of record. In addition, we declared a distribution of $1.21 per share, or $537.6 million, paid on February 2, 2021 to our common stockholders of record at the close of business on December 28, 2020.We accrue distributions on unvested restricted stock units, which are payable upon vesting. The amount accrued for distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units was $12.6 million and $14.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid $7.8 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units. For more details on the cash distributions paid to our common stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2020, see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.Material Cash Requirements—The following table summarizes material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in millions):20212022202320242025ThereafterTotalDebt obligations (1)$789.8 $1,304.6 $3,318.9 $2,151.9 $7,566.0 $14,331.5 $29,462.7 Operating lease obligations (2)901.1 869.0 836.4 798.0 751.8 6,423.4 10,579.7 44Table of Contents ______________(1) Includes aggregate principal maturities of long-term debt, including finance lease obligations (see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).(2) Includes payments under non-cancellable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option, which we expect to renew because failure to do so could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases (see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).Distributions—We expect that our 2021 total distributions paid to our common stockholders will be $2.3 billion. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. Signed Acquisitions—On November 28, 2019, we entered into definitive agreements with Orange for the acquisition of up to approximately 2,000 communications sites in France over a period of up to five years for total consideration in the range of approximately 500.0 million EUR to 600.0 million EUR (approximately $550.5 million to $660.5 million at the date of signing) to be paid over the five-year term. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed the acquisition of 564 communications sites. The remaining communications sites are expected to close in tranches, subject to customary closing conditions.On December 19, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire approximately 3,200 communications sites in Chile and Peru from Entel PCS Telecomunicaciones S.A. and Entel Peru S.A. for total consideration of approximately $0.8 billion (as of the date of signing). We completed the acquisition of approximately 2,400 communications sites in December 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed the acquisition of an additional 530 communications sites pursuant to this agreement for an aggregate total purchase price of $137.7 million (as of the dates of acquisition), including value added tax. The remaining communications sites are expected to continue to close in tranches, subject to certain closing conditions.On January 13, 2021, we entered into the Pending Telxius Acquisition for approximately 7.7 billion EUR (approximately $9.4 billion at the date of signing), subject to limited adjustments. The Pending Telxius Acquisition is expected to close in tranches beginning in the second quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including government and regulatory approval.Asset Retirement Obligations—We are required to remove our tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of our tower assets are located. As of December 31, 2020, the estimated undiscounted future cash outlay for asset retirement obligations was $3.7 billion. Purchase of Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests— As described above, we expect to pay an amount equivalent to INR 12.9 billion (approximately $176.6 million) to redeem the shares of our remaining minority holders in ATC TIPL in 2021, subject to regulatory approval. Factors Affecting Sources of LiquidityOur liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities, borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness. We believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants, our compliance with which would be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity.Internally Generated Funds—Because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2020 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities depends upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites.Restrictions Under Loan Agreements Relating to Our Credit Facilities—The loan agreements for the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2019 Credit Facility, the 2019 Term Loan and the 2021 Delayed Draw Term Loans contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These restrictions include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage, as set forth in the table below. As 45Table of Contents of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. Compliance Tests For The 12 Months Ended December 31, 2020($ in billions)Ratio (1)Additional Debt Capacity Under Covenants (2)Capacity for Adjusted EBITDA Decrease Under Covenants (3)Consolidated Total Leverage RatioTotal Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 6.00:1.00~$2.5~$0.4Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage RatioSenior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 3.00:1.00~$12.6 (4)~$4.2_______________(1) Each component of the ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement.(2) Assumes no change to Adjusted EBITDA.(3) Assumes no change to our debt levels. (4) Effectively, however, additional Senior Secured Debt under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio.Under the terms of the agreements for the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2019 Credit Facility, the 2019 Term Loan and the 2021 Delayed Draw Term Loans, the Pending Telxius Acquisition is designated as a Qualified Acquisition, whereby our Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is adjusted to not exceed 7:50 to 1:00 for four fiscal quarters following consummation of the Pending Telxius Acquisition. The loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants.Failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but may also constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants.Restrictions Under Agreements Relating to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations—The indenture and related supplemental indenture governing the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the “Series 2015-2 Notes”) issued by GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC (“GTP Acquisition Partners”) in a private securitization transaction in May 2015 (the “2015 Securitization”) and the loan agreement related to the securitization transactions completed in March 2013 (the “2013 Securitization”) and March 2018 (the “2018 Securitization” and, together with the 2013 Securitization, the “Trust Securitizations”) include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, GTP Acquisition Partners and American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the “AMT Asset Subs”) are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets, subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the applicable agreements).Under the agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the Series 2015-2 Notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan that secures the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A (the “Series 2013-2A Securities”), Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A (the “Series 2018-1A Securities”), and the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R (the “Series 2018-1R Securities” and, together with the Series 2018-1A Securities, the “2018 Securities”) issued in the Trust Securitizations (the “Loan”), as applicable, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement, subject to the conditions described in the table below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs, as applicable, which can then be distributed to, and used by, us. As of December 31, 2020, $81.0 million held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash. Certain information with respect to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations is set forth below. The debt service coverage ratio (“DSCR”) is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination. 46Table of Contents Issuer or BorrowerNotes/Securities IssuedConditions Limiting Distributions of Excess CashExcess Cash Distributed During Year Ended December 31, 2020DSCR as of December 31, 2020Capacity for Decrease in Net Cash Flow Before Triggering Cash Trap DSCR (1)Capacity for Decrease in Net Cash Flow Before Triggering Minimum DSCR (1)Cash Trap DSCRAmortization Period(in millions)(in millions)(in millions)2015 Securitization (2)GTP Acquisition PartnersAmerican Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1 and Series 2015-21.30x, Tested Quarterly (3)(4)(5)$269.316.00x$270.5$273.3Trust SecuritizationsAMT Asset SubsSecured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A, Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A and Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R1.30x, Tested Quarterly (3)(4)(6)$448.811.31x$597.9$606.9_______________(1) Based on the net cash flow of the applicable issuer or borrower as of December 31, 2020 and the expenses payable over the next 12 months on the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, as applicable. (2) On the June 2020 payment date, the Series 2015-1 Notes were repaid in full. As of December 31, 2020, none of the Series 2015-1 Notes remained outstanding. (3) Once triggered, a Cash Trap DSCR condition continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. During a Cash Trap DSCR condition, all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account (the “Cash Trap Reserve Account”) instead of being released to the applicable issuer or borrower. (4) An amortization period commences if the DSCR is equal to or below 1.15x (the “Minimum DSCR”) at the end of any calendar quarter and continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters.(5) No amortization period is triggered if the outstanding principal amount of a series has not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date. However, in such event, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the applicable series, and such series will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow.(6) An amortization period exists if the outstanding principal amount has not been paid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date and continues to exist until such principal has been repaid in full. A failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions and to meet REIT distribution requirements. During an “amortization period,” all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the applicable Cash Trap Reserve Account would be applied to pay principal of the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, on each monthly payment date, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Further, additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to the Series 2015-2 Notes or subclass of the Loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement. With respect to the Series 2015-2 Notes, upon the occurrence of, and during, an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of the Series 2015-2 Notes, declare the Series 2015-2 Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes. Furthermore, if GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs were to default on the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 3,538 communications sites that secure the Series 2015-2 Notes or the 5,114 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets that secure the Loan, respectively, in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assets.As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our distribution requirements and repay or repurchase our debt. If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Additionally, as further discussed under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” extreme market volatility and disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic 47Table of Contents may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities, or impact the terms of any new obligations. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and debt service obligations or refinance our existing indebtedness. In addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and, consequently, a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2020. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.•Impairment of Assets—Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization: We review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable. We review our tower portfolio, network location intangible and right-of-use assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements.We review our tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenant-related intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. Key assumptions included in the undiscounted cash flows are future revenue projections, estimates of ongoing tenancies and operating margins. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment.In October 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued a ruling regarding the definition of AGR and associated fees and charges, which was reaffirmed in March 2020, that may have a material financial impact on certain of our tenants which could affect their ability to perform their obligations under agreements with us. In September 2020, the Supreme Court of India defined the expected timeline of ten years for payments owed under the ruling. We will continue to monitor the status of these developments, as it is possible that the estimated future cash flows may differ from current estimates and changes in estimated cash flows from tenants in India could have an impact on previously recorded tangible and intangible assets, including amounts originally recorded as tenant-related intangibles. The carrying value of tenant-related intangibles in India was $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2020, which represents 10% of our consolidated balance of $10.1 billion. Additionally, a significant reduction in tenant related cash flows in India could also impact our tower portfolio and network location intangibles. The carrying values of our tower portfolio and network location intangibles in India were $1.0 billion and $410.9 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020, which represent 13% and 11% of our consolidated balances of $8.0 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. 48Table of Contents •Impairment of Assets—Goodwill: We review goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. We employ a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. We compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. During the year ended December 31, 2020, no potential goodwill impairment was identified as the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount. •Asset Retirement Obligations: When required, we recognize the fair value of obligations to remove our tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of our tower assets are located. Generally, the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. We updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of $65.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in 2020 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary.•Acquisitions: We evaluate each of our acquisitions under the accounting guidance framework to determine whether to treat an acquisition as an asset acquisition or a business combination. For those transactions treated as asset acquisitions, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired, with no recognition of goodwill. For those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, we apply the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with our results from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We continue to evaluate acquisitions accounted for as business combinations for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future tenant cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition. •Revenue Recognition: Our revenue is derived from leasing the right to use our communications sites and the land on which the sites are located (the “lease component”) and from the reimbursement of costs incurred in operating the communications sites and supporting the tenants’ equipment as well as other services and contractual rights (the “non-lease component”). Most of our revenue is derived from leasing arrangements and is accounted for as lease revenue unless the timing and pattern of revenue recognition of the non-lease component differs from the lease component. If the timing and pattern of the non-lease component revenue recognition differs from that of the lease component, we separately determine the stand-alone selling prices and pattern of revenue recognition for each performance obligation.Our revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is probable. Escalation clauses tied to a consumer price index or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants, are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total property straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $322.0 million, $183.5 million and $87.6 million, 49Table of Contents respectively. Amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable lease arrangements. Amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met.We derive the largest portion of our revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, with 55% of our revenues derived from three tenants. In addition, we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. We mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our borrowers and tenants. In recognizing tenant revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense. Accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured.•Rent Expense and Lease Accounting: Many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time. In addition, certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. Our calculation of the lease liability includes straight-line ground rent expense for these leases based on the term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. Effective January 1, 2019, we adopted the new lease standard using the modified retrospective method applied to lease arrangements that were in place on the transition date. The new lease accounting guidance required us to recognize a right-of-use lease asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases. The right-of-use asset is measured as the sum of the lease liability, prepaid or accrued lease payments, any initial direct costs incurred and any other applicable amounts.The calculation of the lease liability requires us to make certain assumptions for each lease, including lease term and discount rate implicit in each lease, which could significantly impact the gross lease obligation, the duration and the present value of the lease liability. When calculating the lease term, we consider the renewal, cancellation and termination rights available to us and the lessor. We determine the discount rate by calculating the incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis at the commencement of a lease or upon a change in the lease term.•Income Taxes: Accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes. To the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes, deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We do not expect to pay federal income taxes on our REIT taxable income.We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes, if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability.We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination, which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit.50Table of Contents Accounting Standards UpdateFor a discussion of recent accounting standards updates, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe following table provides information as of December 31, 2020 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates. For long-term debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows by maturity date and average interest rates related to outstanding obligations.

This swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge, has a notional amount of $8.7 million, has an interest rate of 5.37% and expires in April 2021. We also have three interest rate swap agreements related to the 2.250% Notes. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of $600.0 million, an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expire in January 2022. In addition, we have three interest rate swap agreements related to a portion of the 3.000% Notes. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of $500.0 million, an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expire in June 2023.Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2020 consisted of $2.3 billion under the 2019 Credit Facility, $1.0 billion under the 2019 Term Loan, $750.0 million under the 2020 Term Loan, $600.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 2.250% Notes, $500.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 3.000% Notes and $2.9 million under the Colombian credit facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements. A 10% increase in current interest rates would result in an additional $6.1 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020. Foreign Currency Risk51Table of Contents We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar is reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 42% of our revenues and 52% of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies.As of December 31, 2020, we have incurred intercompany debt that is not considered to be permanently reinvested, and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As this debt had not been designated as being a long-term investment in nature, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. An adverse change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in $129.2 million of unrealized losses that would be included in Other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.",2023-12-30 19:23:03.411148
1053507,AMT,AMERICAN TOWER CORP /MA/,2022,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the accompanying notes, and the information set forth under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” below.During the fourth quarter of 2021, as a result of the CoreSite Acquisition, we updated our reportable segments to add a Data Centers segment. The Data Centers segment is included within our property operations. We will now report our results in seven segments – U.S. & Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. We believe this change provides greater visibility into our operating segments and aligns our reporting with management’s current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments. This change applies to our business operations results beginning with the fourth quarter of 2021 and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any prior periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report has not been adjusted as the amounts attributable to data center assets were insignificant as prior to to the fourth quarter of 2021, we owned one data center. In evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses, among other factors, segment gross margin and segment operating profit (see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Executive OverviewWe are one of the largest global REITs and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators, and, as discussed further below, we hold a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States. Our customers include our tenants, licensees and other payers. We refer to the business encompassing the above as our property operations, which accounted for 97% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 and includes our U.S. & Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property and Latin America property segments and Data Centers segment. We also offer tower-related services in the United States, including site application, zoning and permitting and structural analysis, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. 23Table of Contents The following table details the number of communications sites, excluding managed sites, that we owned or operated as of December 31, 2021: Number ofOwned TowersNumber ofOperated Towers (1)Number ofOwned DAS SitesU.S. & Canada:Canada218 — — United States27,276 15,363 451 U.S. & Canada total27,494 15,363 451 Asia-Pacific: (2)Bangladesh120 — — India74,596 — 912 Philippines97 — — Asia-Pacific total74,813 — 912 Africa:Burkina Faso707 — — Ghana3,384 661 28 Kenya2,997 — 9 Niger754 — — Nigeria6,980 — — South Africa2,923 — — Uganda3,710 — 12 Africa total21,455 661 49 Europe:France3,444 310 9 Germany14,739 — — Poland 49 — — Spain11,490 — — Europe total29,722 310 9 Latin America:Argentina487 — 11 Brazil20,732 2,083 109 Chile3,737 — 137 Colombia4,982 — 6 Costa Rica690 — 2 Mexico9,845 186 92 Paraguay1,443 — — Peru3,900 450 — Latin America total45,816 2,719 357 _______________(1)Approximately 95% of the operated towers are held pursuant to long-term finance leases, including those subject to purchase options. (2)We also control land under carrier or other third-party communications sites in Australia, which provides recurring cash flow through tenant leasing arrangements.In January 2021, we entered into the Telxius Acquisition, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire Telxius’ European and Latin American tower divisions, comprising approximately 31,000 communications sites in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Peru and Spain, for approximately 7.7 billion EUR (approximately $9.4 billion at the date of signing), subject to certain adjustments. We completed the acquisition of nearly 27,000 communications sites in June 2021 and acquired the approximately 4,000 remaining communications sites in Germany in August 2021, for total consideration of approximately 7.9 billion EUR (approximately $9.6 billion as of the closing dates), subject to certain post-closing adjustments.In December 2021, we completed the CoreSite Acquisition, through which we acquired over 20 data center facilities and related assets in eight United States markets, for total consideration of $10.4 billion, including the assumption and repayment of CoreSite’s existing debt.As of December 31, 2021, our property portfolio included 27 operating data center facilities across ten markets in the United States that collectively comprise approximately 3.1 million NRSF of data center space, as detailed below: Number ofData CentersTotal NRSF (1)(in thousands)San Francisco Bay, CA8 940 Los Angeles, CA3 686 Northern Virginia, VA5 536 New York, NY2 203 Chicago, IL2 233 Boston, MA1 143 Denver, CO2 35 Miami, FL1 30 Orlando, FL1 129 Atlanta, GA2 128 Total27 3,063 _______________(1)Excludes approximately 0.4 million of office and light-industrial NRSF acquired as part of the CoreSite Acquisition.In most of our markets, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers generally have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. Accordingly, the vast majority of the revenue generated by our property operations during the year ended December 31, 2021 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Most of our tenant leases for our communications sites have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically based on an annual fixed escalation (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or a combination of both. In addition, certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs. Based upon existing customer leases and foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2021, we expect to generate over $61 billion of non-cancellable customer lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting. The revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts, which typically are non-cancellable; however, in some instances, a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee.Revenue lost from either tenant lease cancellations or the non-renewal of leases or rent renegotiations, which we refer to as churn, has historically not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our consolidated property operations. During the year ended December 31, 2021, churn was approximately 4% of our tenant billings. Beginning in late 2017, we experienced an increase in revenue lost from cancellations or non-renewals primarily due to carrier consolidation-driven churn in India, which compressed our gross margin and operating profit, particularly in our Asia-Pacific property segment, although this impact was partially offset by lower expenses due to reduced tenancy on existing sites and the decommissioning of certain sites. For the year ended December 31, 2021, aggregate carrier consolidation in India did not have a material impact on our consolidated property revenue, gross margin or operating profit, although overall churn rates in India remained elevated relative to historical levels.We anticipate that our churn rate in India will moderate over time and result in reduced impacts on our property revenue, gross margin and operating profit. In the immediate term, we believe that our churn rate may remain elevated as our tenants in India evaluate how best to comply with the recent court rulings by the Supreme Court of India and determine their obligations under payment plans for the AGR fees and charges prescribed by such court, as further discussed in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors—Our business, and that of our customers, is subject to laws, regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, and changes thereto, that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape.” We expect to periodically evaluate the carrying value of our Indian assets, which may result in the realization of additional impairment expense or other similar charges. For more information, please see the information under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.”Additionally, we expect that our churn rate in our U.S. & Canada property segment will remain elevated for a period of several years due to contractual lease cancellations and non-renewals by T-Mobile, including legacy Sprint Corporation leases, pursuant to the terms of the T-Mobile MLA entered into in September 2020.As further set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the response to mitigate its spread and effects, may adversely impact us and our customers and the demand for our communications infrastructure in the United States and globally. We have taken a variety of actions to ensure the continued availability of our communications infrastructure assets, while ensuring the safety and security of our employees, customers, 24Table of Contents vendors and surrounding communities. These measures include providing support for our customers remotely, supporting continued work-from-home arrangements and restricting travel for our employees where practicable and other modifications to our business practices. We will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions as may be required by governmental authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners.Property Operations Revenue Growth. Due to our diversified communications site portfolio, our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. We measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. In many instances, tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation capital expenditures, which are often reimbursed to us.The primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our property segments are:•Growth in tenant billings, including:•New revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our sites (“colocations”) and lease amendments; •Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of churn; and•New revenue attributable to leases in place on day one on sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior-year period.•Revenue growth from our Data Centers segment in the United States, including growth attributable to increased customer demand for space, power and interconnection services and solutions.•Revenue growth from other items, including additional tenant payments primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs included in certain tenant leases (“pass-through”), straight-line revenue and decommissioning.We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue, which makes up the vast majority of our property segment revenue, is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services globally and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our communications real estate. By adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, we are able to increase these sites’ utilization and profitability. We believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers, with tenants in a number of other industries contributing incremental leasing demand. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks, while also deploying next generation wireless technologies. In addition, we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk-adjusted return on investment objectives. Property Operations Organic Revenue Growth. Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment from our sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers and other tenants deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless services, the penetration of advanced wireless devices, the level of emphasis on network quality and capacity in carrier competition, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions. According to industry data, recent aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the United States has averaged at least $30 billion, resulting in consistent demand for our sites. Based on industry research and projections, we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us:•In less advanced wireless markets where network deployments are in earlier stages, we expect these deployments to drive demand for our tower space as carriers seek to expand their footprints and increase the scope and density of their networks. We have established operations in many of these markets at the early stages of wireless development, which we believe will enable us to meaningfully participate in these deployments over the long term.•Subscribers’ use of mobile data continues to grow rapidly given increasing smartphone and other advanced device penetration, the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications on these devices and the continuing evolution of the mobile ecosystem. We believe carriers will be compelled to deploy additional equipment on existing networks while also rolling out more advanced wireless networks to address coverage and capacity needs resulting from this increasing mobile data usage.•The deployment of advanced mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G, will provide higher speed data services and further enable fixed broadband substitution. As a result, we expect that our tenants will continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks.•Wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their networks, which is driven by capacity and coverage. To maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases, our tenants continue to deploy 25Table of Contents additional equipment across their existing sites while also adding new cell sites. We anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years, as existing network density is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage. •Wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum, and as a result are expected to add additional sites and equipment to their networks as they seek to optimize their network configuration and utilize additional spectrum. We expect this to be particularly relevant in the context of higher-band spectrum such as 2.5 gigahertz (GHz) and C-Band being deployed for 5G, as these spectrum assets tend to have more limited propagation characteristics compared to the lower-band spectrum that has historically been deployed on our towers.•Next generation technologies requiring wireless connectivity have the potential to provide incremental revenue opportunities for us. These technologies may include edge computing functionality, autonomous vehicle networks and a number of other internet-of-things, or IoT, applications, as well as other potential use cases for wireless services. These technologies may create new and complementary use cases for our communications real estate over time, although these use cases are currently in nascent stages.•Continued data growth and emerging high-performance, latency-sensitive applications will drive an increased need for reliable, secure and interconnected data center solutions. We believe these trends will result in incremental utilization and interconnection demand at our data center facilities. As part of our international expansion initiatives, we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term. In addition, we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers to increase the opportunities for growth or mutually beneficial transactional opportunities across common markets. We believe that consistent carrier network investments across our international markets will, over the long term, position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward.In emerging markets, such as Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ghana, India, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, the Philippines and Uganda, wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the United States, and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in certain underdeveloped areas. A majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services and advanced device penetration remains low. In more developed urban locations within these markets, mobile data usage tends to be higher and advanced network deployments are further along. Carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while increasing investments in data networks as mobile data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate. In India, the ongoing transition from 2G technology to 4G technology has included a period of carrier consolidation, whereby the number of carriers operating in the marketplace has been reduced through mergers, acquisitions and select carrier exits from the marketplace, which we believe is now substantially complete. We believe that this consolidation process has resulted in an industry structure for both the wireless carriers and communications infrastructure providers that will be more conducive to sustained growth and profitability over time. In markets with rapidly evolving network technology, such as South Africa, Poland and most of the countries in Latin America where we do business, initial voice networks, for the most part, have already been built out, and carriers are increasingly focused on 4G network deployments. Consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices, in particular as lower cost smartphones become increasingly available. As a result, the usage of bandwidth-intensive mobile applications is growing materially. Recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks. Smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are advancing rapidly, which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks to maintain and augment their quality of service.Finally, in markets with more mature network technology, such as Australia, Canada, Germany, France and Spain, carriers are focused on deploying 4G data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their customer base. With higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage, carrier investment in networks is focused on 4G coverage and capacity, as well as the early stages of 5G deployment.We believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the United States, which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years, will be replicated in our international markets over time. As a result, we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 177,000 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier tenants to drive sustainable, long-term growth.We have master lease agreements with many of our tenants for our communications sites that provide for consistent, long-term revenue and reduce the likelihood of non-contractual churn. Certain of those master lease agreements are comprehensive in nature and further build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants while significantly reducing colocation cycle times, thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites.26Table of Contents Demand for our communications infrastructure assets could be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including an increase in network sharing or consolidation among our customers, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the captions “Risk Factors—If our customers consolidate their operations, exit their businesses or share site infrastructure to a significant degree, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected” and “Risk Factors—A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of customers, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers.” In addition, the emergence and growth of new technologies could reduce demand for our sites, as set forth under the caption “Risk Factors—New technologies or changes in our or a customer’s business model could make our communications infrastructure leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results.” Further, our customers may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications infrastructure assets.Property Operations New Site Revenue Growth. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 38,950 communications sites globally. In a majority of our Asia-Pacific, Africa, Europe and Latin America markets, the revenue generated from newly acquired or constructed sites resulted in increases in both tenant and pass-through revenues (such as ground rent or power and fuel costs) and expenses. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios, both domestically and internationally, to determine whether they meet our risk-adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio.New Sites (Acquired or Constructed)202120202019U.S. & Canada170 2,255 430 Asia-Pacific3,780 3,960 3,330 Africa2,355 1,540 6,455 Europe24,775 610 15 Latin America7,870 1,000 3,475 During the year ended December 31, 2021, we also grew our portfolio of data center facilities through the acquisition of over 20 data center facilities and related assets in the United States, including through the CoreSite Acquisition.Property Operations Expenses. Direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site or facility level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our customers, as well as property taxes and repairs and maintenance expenses. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled Selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our property segments’ selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites or facilities and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new customers on our sites or within our facilities provides significant incremental gross margin and cash flow. We may, however, incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new customers to our sites or facilities but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities.Services Segment Revenue Growth. As we continue to focus on growing our property operations, we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIncluded in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (“Adjusted EBITDA”), Funds From Operations, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit FFO”) attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations (“Consolidated AFFO”) and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders.We define Adjusted EBITDA as Net income before Income (loss) from equity method investments; Income tax benefit (provision); Other income (expense); Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; Interest expense; Interest income; Other operating income (expense); Depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense. Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling 27Table of Contents interests. In this section, we refer to Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “Nareit FFO (common stockholders).” We define Consolidated AFFO as Nareit FFO (common stockholders) before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) the deferred portion of income tax and other income tax adjustments; (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion; (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges; (vi) other income (expense); (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; (viii) other operating income (expense); and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interests, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures. We define AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as Consolidated AFFO, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both Nareit FFO (common stockholders) and the other adjustments included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. In this section, we refer to AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “AFFO (common stockholders).” Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. None of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO or AFFO (common stockholders) represents cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or a measure of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for decision making purposes and for evaluating our operating segments’ performance; (2) Adjusted EBITDA is a component underlying our credit ratings; (3) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4) Consolidated AFFO is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to adjust Nareit FFO (common stockholders) for items that may otherwise cause material fluctuations in Nareit FFO (common stockholders) growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of property assets in those periods; (5) each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (6) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies, particularly those in our industry.Our measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included below.28Table of Contents Results of OperationsYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019For a discussion of our 2020 Results of Operations, including a discussion of our financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, refer to Part I, Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2021 (the “2020 Form 10-K”).During the fourth quarter of 2021, as a result of the CoreSite Acquisition, we updated our reportable segments to add a Data Centers segment. The Data Centers segment is included within our property operations. We will now report our results in seven segments – U.S. & Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. We believe this change provides greater visibility into our operating segments and aligns our reporting with management’s current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments.

Additionally, we use our cash flows to make distributions, including distributions of our REIT taxable income to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We may also repay or repurchase our existing indebtedness or equity from time to time. We typically fund our international expansion efforts primarily through a combination of cash on hand, intercompany debt and equity contributions. In February 2021, we entered into an agreement with Macquarie SBI Infrastructure Investments Pte Limited and SBI Macquarie Infrastructure Trust (together, “Macquarie”), our remaining minority holders in ATC TIPL, to redeem 100% of their combined holdings in ATC TIPL (see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report) at a price of INR 175 per share, subject to certain adjustments. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we redeemed 100% of Macquarie’s 36Table of Contents combined holdings in ATC TIPL, for total consideration of INR 12.9 billion (approximately $173.2 million at the date of redemption). As a result of the redemption, we now hold a 100% ownership interest in ATC TIPL.In May 2021 and June 2021, in connection with the funding of the Telxius Acquisition, we entered into agreements for CDPQ and Allianz to acquire 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively, in ATC Europe. We completed the ATC Europe Transactions in September 2021 for total aggregate consideration of 2.6 billion EUR (approximately $3.1 billion at the date of closing). After the completion of the ATC Europe Transactions, we hold a 52% controlling ownership interest in ATC Europe.As of December 31, 2021, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $43.5 billion, with a current portion of $4.6 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations, together with borrowings under our credit facilities, the 2021 EUR Delayed Draw Term Loans and the 2021 USD Delayed Draw Term Loans, proceeds from our equity and debt issuances and cash on hand, to fund our acquisitions, capital expenditures and debt service obligations, as well as our required distributions. We believe the cash generated by operating activities during the year ending December 31, 2022, together with our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our required distributions, capital expenditures, debt service obligations (interest and principal repayments) and signed acquisitions. As of December 31, 2021, we had $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $292.4 million was held by our joint ventures. While certain subsidiaries may pay us interest or principal on intercompany debt, it has not been our practice to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs. However, in the event that we do repatriate any funds, we may be required to accrue and pay certain taxes. Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesFor the year ended December 31, 2021, cash provided by operating activities increased $938.5 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.

On January 7, 2022, we repaid the entire amount outstanding under the CoreSite Debt, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, January 7, 2022, for an aggregate redemption price of $962.9 million, including $80.1 million of prepayment consideration and $7.8 million in accrued and unpaid interest. The repayment of the CoreSite Debt was funded with borrowings under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility and cash on hand. Stock Repurchase Programs—In March 2011, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our common stock (the “2011 Buyback”). In December 2017, our Board of Directors approved an additional stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of our common stock (the “2017 Buyback,” and, together with the 2011 Buyback, the “Buyback Programs”).During the year ended December 31, 2021, we made no repurchases under either of the Buyback Programs.Under each program, we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions not to exceed market prices and subject to market conditions and other factors. With respect to open market purchases, we may use plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements, which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we may otherwise be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. These programs may be discontinued at any time.We have repurchased a total of 14.4 million shares of our common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $1.5 billion, including commissions and fees. We expect to continue managing the pacing of the remaining approximately $2.0 billion under the Buyback Programs in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors. We expect to fund any further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Repurchases under the Buyback Programs are subject to, among other things, us having available cash to fund the repurchases. Sales of Equity Securities—We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plan, as amended (the “2007 Plan”). During the year ended December 31, 2021, we received an aggregate of $96.8 million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and sales pursuant to the ESPP. 2020 “At the Market” Stock Offering Program—In August 2020, we established an “at the market” stock offering program through which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $1.0 billion (the “2020 ATM Program”). Sales under the 2020 ATM Program may be made by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or, subject to our specific instructions, at negotiated prices. We intend to use the net proceeds from any issuances under the 2020 ATM Program for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, the funding of acquisitions, additions to working capital and repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, we have not sold any shares of common stock under the 2020 ATM Program.Common Stock Offering—On May 10, 2021, we completed a registered public offering of 9,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at $244.75 per share. On May 10, 2021, we issued an additional 900,000 shares of our common stock in connection with the underwriters’ exercise in full of their over-allotment option. Aggregate net proceeds from this offering were approximately $2.4 billion after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. We used the net proceeds to finance the Telxius Acquisition. Distributions—As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we have distributed, and expect to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income after taking into 44Table of Contents consideration our utilization of NOLs. We have distributed an aggregate of approximately $11.8 billion to our common stockholders, including the dividend paid in January 2022, primarily classified as ordinary income that may be treated as qualified REIT dividends under Section 199A of the Code for taxable years ending before 2026. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.During the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid $5.03 per share, or $2.3 billion, to common stockholders of record. In addition, we declared a distribution of $1.39 per share, or $633.5 million, paid on January 14, 2022 to our common stockholders of record at the close of business on December 27, 2021.We accrue distributions on unvested restricted stock units, which are payable upon vesting. The amount accrued for distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units was $12.8 million and $12.6 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid $7.5 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units. For more details on the cash distributions paid to our common stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2021, see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.Material Cash Requirements—The following table summarizes material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2021 (in millions):20222023202420252026ThereafterTotalDebt obligations (1)$4,568.7 $4,512.7 $3,091.0 $8,134.5 $3,370.1 $19,820.5 $43,497.5 Operating lease obligations (2)1,125.9 1,071.7 1,028.0 969.4 919.9 6,935.4 12,050.3 ______________(1) Includes aggregate principal maturities of long-term debt, including finance lease obligations (see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).(2) Includes payments under non-cancellable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option, which we expect to renew because failure to do so could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases (see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).Distributions—We expect that our 2022 total distributions declared to our common stockholders will be $2.8 billion. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. Signed Acquisitions—On November 28, 2019, we entered into definitive agreements with Orange for the acquisition of up to approximately 2,000 communications sites in France over a period of up to five years for total consideration in the range of approximately 500.0 million EUR to 600.0 million EUR (approximately $550.5 million to $660.5 million at the date of signing) to be paid over the five-year term. As of December 31, 2021, we have completed the acquisition of nearly 1,200 communications sites. The remaining communications sites are expected to close in tranches, subject to customary closing conditions.Asset Retirement Obligations—We are required to remove our assets and remediate the leased sites upon which certain of our assets are located. As of December 31, 2021, the estimated undiscounted future cash outlay for asset retirement obligations was $4.2 billion. Factors Affecting Sources of LiquidityOur liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities, borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness. We believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants, our compliance with which would be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity.Internally Generated Funds—Because the majority of our customer leases are multiyear contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2021 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities depends upon the demand for our 45Table of Contents communications infrastructure and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications infrastructure.Restrictions Under Loan Agreements Relating to Our Credit Facilities—The loan agreements for the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility, the 2021 Term Loan, the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, the 2021 USD 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan and the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These restrictions include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage, as set forth in the table below. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. Compliance Tests For The 12 Months Ended December 31, 2021($ in billions)Ratio (1)Additional Debt Capacity Under Covenants (2)Capacity for Adjusted EBITDA Decrease Under Covenants (3)Consolidated Total Leverage RatioTotal Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 7.50:1.00~$5.4~$0.7Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage RatioSenior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 3.00:1.00~$16.1 (4)~$5.4_______________(1) Each component of the ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement.(2) Assumes no change to Adjusted EBITDA.(3) Assumes no change to our debt levels. (4) Effectively, however, additional Senior Secured Debt under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio.Under the terms of the agreements for the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility, the 2021 Term Loan, the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, the 2021 USD 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan and the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, the Telxius Acquisition and the CoreSite Acquisition are designated as a Qualified Acquisitions, whereby our Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is adjusted to not exceed 7:50 to 1:00 for four fiscal quarters following consummation of the Telxius Acquisition, which began with the quarter ended June 30, 2021 and for four fiscal quarters following consummation of the CoreSite Acquisition, which began with the quarter ended December 31, 2021. The loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants.Failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but may also constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants.Restrictions Under Agreements Relating to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations—The indenture and related supplemental indenture governing the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the “Series 2015-2 Notes”) issued by GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC (“GTP Acquisition Partners”) in the 2015 Securitization and the loan agreement related to the Trust Securitizations include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, GTP Acquisition Partners and American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the “AMT Asset Subs”) are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets, subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the applicable agreements).Under the agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the Series 2015-2 Notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan that secures the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A (the “Series 2013-2A Securities”), Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A (the “Series 2018-1A Securities”), and the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R (the “Series 2018-1R Securities” and, together with the Series 2018-1A Securities, the “2018 Securities”) issued in the Trust Securitizations (the “Loan”), as applicable, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement, subject to the conditions described in the 46Table of Contents table below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs, as applicable, which can then be distributed to, and used by, us. As of December 31, 2021, $358.8 million held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash. Certain information with respect to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations is set forth below. The debt service coverage ratio (“DSCR”) is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination.

(2) Once triggered, a Cash Trap DSCR condition continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. During a Cash Trap DSCR condition, all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account (the “Cash Trap Reserve Account”) instead of being released to the applicable issuer or borrower. (3) An amortization period commences if the DSCR is equal to or below 1.15x (the “Minimum DSCR”) at the end of any calendar quarter and continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters.(4) No amortization period is triggered if the outstanding principal amount of a series has not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date. However, in such event, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the applicable series, and such series will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow.(5) An amortization period exists if the outstanding principal amount has not been paid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date and continues to exist until such principal has been repaid in full. A failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions and to meet REIT distribution requirements. During an “amortization period,” all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the applicable Cash Trap Reserve Account would be applied to pay the principal of the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, on each monthly payment date, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Further, additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to the Series 2015-2 Notes or subclass of the Loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement. With respect to the Series 2015-2 Notes, upon the occurrence of, and during, an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of the Series 2015-2 Notes, declare the Series 2015-2 Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes. Furthermore, if GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs were to default on the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 3,531 communications sites that secure the Series 2015-2 Notes or the 5,113 broadcast and wireless communications towers and 47Table of Contents related assets that secure the Loan, respectively, in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assets.As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our distribution requirements and repay or repurchase our debt. If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Further, as further discussed under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” extreme market volatility and disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities, or impact the terms of any new obligations. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and debt service obligations or refinance our existing indebtedness. In addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and, consequently, a failure by a significant customer to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2021. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.•Impairment of Assets—Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization: We review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable. We review our tower portfolio, network location intangible and right-of-use assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements.We review our tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenant-related intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. Key assumptions included in the undiscounted cash flows are future revenue projections, estimates of ongoing tenancies and operating margins. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment.In October 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued a ruling regarding the definition of AGR and associated fees and charges, which was reaffirmed in March 2020, that may have a material financial impact on certain of our tenants which could affect their ability to perform their obligations under agreements with us. In September 2020, the Supreme Court of India defined the expected timeline of ten years for payments owed under the ruling. In September 2021, the government in India approved a relief package, that, among other things, included (i) a four year moratorium on the payment of AGR fees owed and (ii) a change in the definition of AGR on a prospective basis. We will continue to 48Table of Contents monitor the status of these developments, as it is possible that the estimated future cash flows may differ from current estimates and changes in estimated cash flows from tenants in India could have an impact on previously recorded tangible and intangible assets, including amounts originally recorded as tenant-related intangibles. The carrying value of tenant-related intangibles in India was $0.9 billion as of December 31, 2021, which represents 6% of our consolidated balance of $15.0 billion. Additionally, a significant reduction in tenant related cash flows in India could also impact our tower portfolio and network location intangibles. The carrying values of our tower portfolio and network location intangibles in India were $1.0 billion and $367.4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2021, which represent 12% and 9% of our consolidated balances of $9.0 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. •Impairment of Assets—Goodwill: We review goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. We employ a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. We compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. During the year ended December 31, 2021, no potential goodwill impairment was identified as the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount.•Acquisitions: We evaluate each of our acquisitions under the accounting guidance framework to determine whether to treat an acquisition as an asset acquisition or a business combination. For those transactions treated as asset acquisitions, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired, with no recognition of goodwill. For those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, we apply the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with our results from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We continue to evaluate acquisitions accounted for as business combinations for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future tenant cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition. •Revenue Recognition: Our revenue is derived from leasing the right to use our communications sites, the land on which the sites are located and our data center facilities (the “lease component”) and from the reimbursement of costs incurred in operating the communications sites and supporting the tenants’ equipment as well as other services and contractual rights (the “non-lease component”). Most of our revenue is derived from leasing arrangements and is accounted for as lease revenue unless the timing and pattern of revenue recognition of the non-lease component differs from the lease component. If the timing and pattern of the non-lease component revenue recognition differs from that of the lease component, we separately determine the stand-alone selling prices and pattern of revenue recognition for each performance obligation.Our revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is probable. Escalation clauses tied to a consumer price index or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants, are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total property straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $465.6 million, $322.0 million and $183.5 million, respectively. Amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable lease arrangements. Amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met.49Table of Contents We derive the largest portion of our revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, with 52% of our revenues derived from three tenants. In addition, we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. We mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our borrowers and tenants. In recognizing tenant revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and are subsequently determined to present a risk of collection are reserved as bad debt expense. Accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured.•Rent Expense and Lease Accounting: Many of the leases underlying our tower sites and data centers have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time. In addition, certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. Our calculation of the lease liability includes the term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. We recognize a right-of-use lease asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases. The right-of-use asset is measured as the sum of the lease liability, prepaid or accrued lease payments, any initial direct costs incurred and any other applicable amounts.The calculation of the lease liability requires us to make certain assumptions for each lease, including lease term and discount rate implicit in each lease, which could significantly impact the gross lease obligation, the duration and the present value of the lease liability. When calculating the lease term, we consider the renewal, cancellation and termination rights available to us and the lessor. We determine the discount rate by calculating the incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis at the commencement of a lease or upon a change in the lease term.•Income Taxes: Accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes. To the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes, deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We do not expect to pay federal income taxes on our REIT taxable income.We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes, if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability.We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination, which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit.Accounting Standards UpdateFor a discussion of recent accounting standards updates, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.50Table of Contents ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe following table provides information as of December 31, 2021 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates.

These swaps were designated as fair value hedges, had an aggregate notional amount of $600.0 million, had an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expired in January 2022. The 2.250% Notes were subsequently repaid in full on January 14, 2022. In addition, we have three interest rate swap agreements related to a portion of our 3.000% senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the “3.000% Notes”). These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of $500.0 million, have an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expire in June 2023.Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2021 consisted of $4.4 billion under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, $1.4 billion under the 2021 Credit Facility, $1.0 billion under the 2021 Term Loan, $938.2 million under the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, $3.0 billion under the 2021 USD 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan, $1.5 billion under the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, $600.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 2.250% Notes and $500.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 3.000% Notes. A 10% increase in current interest rates would result in an additional $16.3 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021. Foreign Currency RiskWe are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar is reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. For the year ended December 31, 2021, 44% of our revenues and 52% of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies.51Table of Contents As of December 31, 2021, we have incurred intercompany debt that is not considered to be permanently reinvested, and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As this debt had not been designated as being a long-term investment in nature, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. An adverse change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in $66.7 million of unrealized losses that would be included in Other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we have 7.3 billion EUR (approximately $8.3 billion) denominated debt outstanding. An adverse change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our outstanding EUR debt would result in $0.9 billion of foreign currency losses that would be included in Other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.",2023-12-30 19:22:51.247870
1053507,AMT,AMERICAN TOWER CORP /MA/,2023,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the accompanying notes, and the information set forth under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” below.We report our results in seven segments – U.S. & Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. In evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses, among other factors, segment gross margin and segment operating profit (see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Executive OverviewWe are one of the largest global REITs and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators, and, as discussed further below, we hold a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States. Our customers include our tenants, licensees and other payers. We refer to the business encompassing the above as our property operations, which accounted for 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 and includes our U.S. & Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property and Latin America property segments and Data Centers segment. We also offer tower-related services in the United States, including site application, zoning and permitting, structural analysis and construction management, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. 26Table of Contents The following table details the number of communications sites, excluding managed sites, that we owned or operated as of December 31, 2022: Number ofOwned TowersNumber ofOperated Towers (1)Number ofOwned DAS SitesU.S. & Canada:Canada221 — — United States27,413 15,187 454 U.S. & Canada total27,634 15,187 454 Asia-Pacific: (2)Bangladesh481 — — India76,826 — 822 Philippines340 — — Asia-Pacific total77,647 — 822 Africa:Burkina Faso726 — — Ghana3,503 657 36 Kenya3,416 — 9 Niger860 — — Nigeria7,562 — — South Africa2,994 — — Uganda3,980 — 12 Africa total23,041 657 57 Europe:France3,943 303 8 Germany14,799 — — Poland 57 — — Spain11,610 — 1 Europe total30,409 303 9 Latin America:Argentina497 — 11 Brazil20,644 2,043 121 Chile3,728 — 138 Colombia4,974 — 6 Costa Rica700 — 2 Mexico9,560 186 92 Paraguay1,447 — — Peru3,948 450 1 Latin America total45,498 2,679 371 _______________(1)Approximately 95% of the operated towers are held pursuant to long-term finance leases, including those subject to purchase options. (2)We also control land under carrier or other third-party communications sites in Australia and New Zealand, which provide recurring cash flows through tenant leasing arrangements.As of December 31, 2022, our property portfolio included 28 operating data center facilities across ten markets in the United States that collectively comprise approximately 3.1 million NRSF of data center space, as detailed below: 27Table of Contents Number ofData CentersTotal NRSF (1)(in thousands)San Francisco Bay, CA8 940 Los Angeles, CA3 670 Northern Virginia, VA5 536 New York, NY2 250 Chicago, IL2 216 Boston, MA1 143 Denver, CO2 35 Miami, FL2 47 Orlando, FL1 126 Atlanta, GA2 95 Total28 3,058 _______________(1)Excludes approximately 0.4 million of office and light-industrial NRSF acquired as part of the CoreSite Acquisition.In most of our markets, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers generally have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. Accordingly, the vast majority of the revenue generated by our property operations during the year ended December 31, 2022 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Most of our tenant leases for our communications sites have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically based on an annual fixed escalation (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or a combination of both. In addition, certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs. Based upon existing customer leases and foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2022, we expect to generate over $62 billion of non-cancellable customer lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting. Following the court rulings by the Supreme Court of India regarding carriers’ obligations for the AGR fees and charges prescribed by such court, we continue to experience variability and a level of uncertainty in collections in India. As further discussed in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors—A substantial portion of our current and projected revenue is derived from a small number of customers, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers,” in the third quarter of 2022, our largest customer in India, VIL, communicated that it would make partial payments of its contractual amounts owed to us and indicated that it would continue to make partial payments for the remainder of 2022. In late 2022, VIL had communicated its intent to resume payments in full under its contractual obligations owed to us beginning on January 1, 2023. However, in early 2023, VIL communicated that it would not be able to resume payments in full of its contractual obligations owed to us, and that it would instead continue to make partial payments.We considered these recent developments and the uncertainty with respect to amounts owed under our tenant leases when conducting our annual impairment assessments for long-lived assets and goodwill in India. As a result, we determined that certain fixed and intangible assets had been impaired during the year ended December 31, 2022. An impairment of $97.0 million was taken on tower and network location intangible assets in India. We also impaired the tenant-related intangible assets for VIL, which resulted in an impairment of $411.6 million. We expect to periodically evaluate the carrying value of our Indian assets, which may result in the realization of additional impairment expense or other similar charges. For more information on impairments in India, please see the information under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” included in this Annual Report.In October 2022, and as subsequently amended in February 2023, ATC TIPL and VIL notified the stock exchange of India that both parties have board approvals in relation to an issuance of convertible debentures pursuant to which, in exchange for VIL’s payment of certain amounts towards accounts receivables, ATC TIPL shall pay equivalent amounts towards subscription to convertible debentures issued by VIL. The convertible debentures are to be repaid by VIL with interest and ATC TIPL has the option to convert the debentures into equity of VIL. The issuance of the debentures is subject to certain conditions precedent, which may not be met.As a result of the challenging business environment in India, we are exploring various strategic alternatives aimed at potentially reducing our exposure there, including the sale of an equity interest in our India operations to one or more private investors. Any such completed transaction could have a material impact on our financial statements and on our results of operations in the period in which any such transaction occurred. There can be no assurance that any such strategic alternative will be implemented and, if so implemented, as to the timing thereof, and any such proposed transaction would be subject to conditions, including regulatory approvals in India.28Table of Contents The revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts, which typically are non-cancellable; however, in some instances, a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee.Revenue lost from either tenant lease cancellations or the non-renewal of leases or rent renegotiations, which we refer to as churn, has historically not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our consolidated property operations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, churn was approximately 5% of our tenant billings, primarily driven by churn in our U.S. & Canada property segment, as discussed below. We expect that our churn rate in our U.S. & Canada property segment will remain elevated for a period of several years through 2025 due to contractual lease cancellations and non-renewals by T-Mobile, including legacy Sprint Corporation leases, pursuant to the terms of the T-Mobile MLA entered into in September 2020.We will continue to actively monitor the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions as may be required by governmental authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners.Property Operations Revenue Growth. Due to our diversified communications site portfolio, our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. We measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. In many instances, tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation capital expenditures, which are often reimbursed to us.The primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our property segments are:•Growth in tenant billings, including:•New revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our sites (“colocations”) and lease amendments; •Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of churn; and•New revenue attributable to leases in place on day one on sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior-year period.•Revenue growth from our Data Centers segment in the United States, including rental and power revenue from new lease commencements and expansions, contractual rent and power escalations on existing leases, mark-to-market increases on renewing leases and increased interconnection services and solutions. •Revenue growth from other items, including additional tenant payments primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs included in certain tenant leases (“pass-through”), straight-line revenue and decommissioning.We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue, which makes up the vast majority of our property segment revenue, is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services globally and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our communications real estate. By adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, we are able to increase these sites’ utilization and profitability. We believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers, with tenants in a number of other industries contributing incremental leasing demand. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks, while also deploying next generation wireless technologies. In addition, we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk-adjusted return on investment objectives. Property Operations Organic Revenue Growth. Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment from our sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers and other tenants deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless services, the penetration of advanced wireless devices, the level of emphasis on network quality and capacity in carrier competition, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions. According to industry data, recent aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the United States has averaged at least $30 billion, resulting in consistent demand for our sites. Based on industry research and projections, we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us:•In less advanced wireless markets where network deployments are in earlier stages, we expect these deployments to drive demand for our tower space as carriers seek to expand their footprints and increase the scope and density of their 29Table of Contents networks. We have established operations in many of these markets at the early stages of wireless development, which we believe will enable us to meaningfully participate in these deployments over the long term.•Subscribers’ use of mobile data continues to grow rapidly given increasing smartphone and other advanced device penetration, the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications on these devices and the continuing evolution of the mobile ecosystem. We believe carriers will be compelled to deploy additional equipment on existing networks while also rolling out more advanced wireless networks to address coverage and capacity needs resulting from this increasing mobile data usage.•The deployment of advanced mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G, will provide higher speed data services and further enable fixed broadband substitution. As a result, we expect that our tenants will continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks.•Wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their networks, which is driven by capacity and coverage. To maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases, our tenants continue to deploy additional equipment across their existing sites while also adding new cell sites. We anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years, as existing network density is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage. •Wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum, and as a result are expected to add additional sites and equipment to their networks as they seek to optimize their network configuration and utilize additional spectrum. We expect this to be particularly relevant in the context of higher-band spectrum such as 2.5 gigahertz (GHz) and C-Band being deployed for 5G, as these spectrum assets tend to have more limited propagation characteristics compared to the lower-band spectrum that has historically been deployed on our towers.•Next generation technologies requiring wireless connectivity have the potential to provide incremental revenue opportunities for us. These technologies may include edge computing functionality, autonomous vehicle networks and a number of other internet-of-things, or IoT, applications, as well as other potential use cases for wireless services. These technologies may create new and complementary use cases for our communications real estate over time, although these use cases are currently in nascent stages.•Continued data growth and emerging high-performance, latency-sensitive applications will drive an increased need for reliable, secure and interconnected data center solutions. We believe these trends will result in incremental utilization and interconnection demand at our data center facilities. As part of our international expansion initiatives, we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term. In addition, we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers to increase the opportunities for growth or mutually beneficial transactional opportunities across common markets. We believe that consistent carrier network investments across our international markets will, over the long term, position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward.In emerging markets, such as Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ghana, India, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, the Philippines and Uganda, wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the United States, and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in certain underdeveloped areas. A majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services and advanced device penetration remains low. In more developed urban locations within these markets, mobile data usage tends to be higher and advanced network deployments are further along. Carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while increasing investments in data networks as mobile data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate. In India, the ongoing transition from 2G technology to 4G technology has included a period of carrier consolidation, whereby the number of carriers operating in the marketplace has been reduced through mergers, acquisitions and select carrier exits from the marketplace, which we believe is now substantially complete. We believe that this consolidation process has resulted in an industry structure that is more constructive for both the wireless carriers and communications infrastructure over the long-term.In markets with rapidly evolving network technology, such as South Africa, Poland and most of the countries in Latin America where we do business, initial voice networks, for the most part, have already been built out, and carriers are increasingly focused on 4G network deployments. Consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices, in particular as lower cost smartphones become increasingly available. As a result, the usage of bandwidth-intensive mobile applications is growing materially. Recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks. Smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are advancing rapidly, which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks to maintain and augment their quality of service.Finally, in markets with more mature network technology, such as Australia, Canada, Germany, France, New Zealand and Spain, carriers are focused on deploying 4G data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their 30Table of Contents customer base. With higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage, carrier investment in networks is focused on 4G coverage and capacity, as well as the early stages of 5G deployment.We believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the United States, which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years, will be replicated in our international markets over time. As a result, we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 182,000 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier tenants to drive sustainable, long-term growth.We have master lease agreements with many of our tenants for our communications sites that provide for consistent, long-term revenue and reduce the likelihood of non-contractual churn. Certain of those master lease agreements are comprehensive in nature and further build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants while significantly reducing colocation cycle times, thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites.Demand for our communications infrastructure assets could be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including an increase in network sharing or consolidation among our customers, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the captions “Risk Factors—If our customers consolidate their operations, exit their businesses or share site infrastructure to a significant degree, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected” and “Risk Factors—A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of customers, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our customers.” In addition, the emergence and growth of new technologies could reduce demand for our sites, as set forth under the caption “Risk Factors—New technologies or changes in our or a customer’s business model could make our communications infrastructure leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results.” Further, our customers may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications infrastructure assets.Property Operations New Site Revenue Growth. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 7,405 communications sites globally. In a majority of our Asia-Pacific, Africa, Europe and Latin America markets, the revenue generated from newly acquired or constructed sites resulted in increases in both tenant and pass-through revenues (such as ground rent or power and fuel costs) and expenses. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios, both domestically and internationally, to determine whether they meet our risk-adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio.New Sites (Acquired or Constructed)202220212020U.S. & Canada55 170 2,255 Asia-Pacific4,640 3,780 3,960 Africa1,680 2,355 1,540 Europe690 24,775 610 Latin America340 7,870 1,000 In 2021, we significantly grew our portfolio of data center facilities through the acquisition of over 20 data center facilities and related assets in the United States, including through the CoreSite Acquisition.Property Operations Expenses. Direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site or facility level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our customers, as well as property taxes and repairs and maintenance expenses. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled Selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our property segments’ selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites or facilities and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new customers on our sites or within our facilities provides significant incremental gross margin and cash flow. We may, however, incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new customers to our sites or facilities but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities.Services Segment Revenue Growth. As we continue to focus on growing our property operations, we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. 31Table of Contents Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIncluded in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (“Adjusted EBITDA”), Funds From Operations, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit FFO”) attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations (“Consolidated AFFO”) and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders.We define Adjusted EBITDA as Net income before Income (loss) from equity method investments; Income tax benefit (provision); Other income (expense); Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; Interest expense; Interest income; Other operating income (expense); Depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense. Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends to noncontrolling interests, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interests. In this section, we refer to Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “Nareit FFO (common stockholders).” We define Consolidated AFFO as Nareit FFO (common stockholders) before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) the deferred portion of income tax and other income tax adjustments; (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion; (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges; (vi) other income (expense); (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; (viii) other operating income (expense); and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interests, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures. We define AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as Consolidated AFFO, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both Nareit FFO (common stockholders) and the other adjustments included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. In this section, we refer to AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “AFFO (common stockholders).” Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. None of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO or AFFO (common stockholders) represents cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or a measure of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for decision making purposes and for evaluating our operating segments’ performance; (2) Adjusted EBITDA is a component underlying our credit ratings; (3) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4) Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to adjust Nareit FFO (common stockholders) for items that may otherwise cause material fluctuations in Nareit FFO (common stockholders) growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of property assets in those periods; (5) each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (6) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies, particularly those in our industry.Our measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included below.32Table of Contents Results of OperationsYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020For a discussion of our 2021 Results of Operations, including a discussion of our financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, refer to Part I, Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022 (the “2021 Form 10-K”).Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in millions, except percentages) Revenue Year Ended December 31,Percent Change 2022 vs 2021 20222021PropertyU.S. & Canada$5,006.3 $4,920.2 2 %Asia-Pacific1,077.0 1,199.1 (10)Africa1,192.5 1,005.5 19 Europe735.7 496.2 48 Latin America1,691.9 1,465.4 15 Data Centers766.6 23.2 3,204 Total property10,470.0 9,109.6 15 Services241.1 247.3 (3)Total revenues$10,711.1 $9,356.9 14 %Year ended December 31, 2022 U.S. & Canada property segment revenue growth of $86.1 million was attributable to: • Tenant billings growth of $47.9 million, which was driven by:◦$148.7 million due to colocations and amendments;◦Partially offset by:▪A decrease of $92.5 million resulting from churn in excess of contractual escalations (as discussed above, we expect that our churn rate will be elevated for a period of several years due to the terms of the T-Mobile MLA);▪A decrease of $6.3 million from other tenant billings; and▪A decrease of $2.0 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites, which includes the impact of the disposition of certain operations acquired in connection with our acquisition of InSite Wireless Group, LLC (“InSite,” and the acquisition, the “InSite Acquisition”); and▪An increase of $38.7 million in other revenue, which includes a $35.4 million increase due to straight-line accounting.Segment revenue growth included a decrease of $0.5 million attributable to the negative impact of foreign currency translation related to fluctuations in Canadian Dollar.Asia-Pacific property segment revenue decrease of $122.1 million was attributable to:• A decrease of $78.3 million in other revenue, primarily due to revenue reserves of $52.5 million related to the VIL Shortfall (as discussed above) and a decrease of $13.1 million due to straight-line accounting, primarily related to a write off of VIL balances; and• A decrease of $21.3 million in pass-through revenue, primarily due to revenue reserves of $42.0 million related to the VIL Shortfall, partially offset by an increase in fuel prices;• Partially offset by tenant billings growth of $39.6 million, which was driven by:◦$35.8 million due to colocations and amendments; and◦$23.3 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites;◦Partially offset by:▪A decrease of $18.9 million resulting from churn in excess of contractual escalations; and▪A decrease of $0.6 million from other tenant billings.Segment revenue decline included a decrease of $62.1 million attributable to the negative impact of foreign currency translation related to fluctuations in Indian Rupee (“INR”).Africa property segment revenue growth of $187.0 million was attributable to:33Table of Contents • An increase of $185.3 million in pass-through revenue, primarily due to an increase in fuel prices;• Tenant billings growth of $100.6 million, which was driven by: ◦$55.4 million due to colocations and amendments; ◦$44.0 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites;◦$1.0 million from contractual escalations, net of churn; and◦$0.2 million from other tenant billings; and• An increase of $26.2 million in other revenue, which includes an increase due to straight-line accounting and a decrease in revenue reserves.

Our significant 2022 financing transactions included:•Repayment of debt assumed in connection with the CoreSite Acquisition, including senior unsecured notes previously entered into by CoreSite (the “CoreSite Debt”).•Redemption of our 2.250% senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the “2.250% Notes”) upon their maturity.•Registered public offering in an aggregate amount of $1.3 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturities in 2027 and 2032.•Registered public offering of 9,185,000 shares of our common stock for aggregate net proceeds of $2.3 billion. •The Stonepeak Transaction (as defined and further discussed below) pursuant to which we received an aggregate amount of approximately $3.1 billion.•Repayment of all amounts outstanding under the 2021 USD 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan (as defined below).The following table summarizes our liquidity as of December 31, 2022 (in millions): Available under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility$2,211.3 Available under the 2021 Credit Facility2,920.0 Letters of credit(34.4)Total available under credit facilities, net5,096.9 Cash and cash equivalents2,028.4 Total liquidity$7,125.3 Subsequent to December 31, 2022, we made additional net borrowings of $895.0 million under the 2021 Credit Facility (as defined below) and $655.0 million under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility (as defined below). The borrowings were used to repay existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes.Summary cash flow information is set forth below for the years ended December 31, (in millions): 20222021Net cash provided by (used for):Operating activities$3,696.2 $4,819.9 Investing activities(2,355.2)(20,692.2)Financing activities(1,423.2)16,424.5 Net effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash(120.4)(70.3)Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash$(202.6)$481.9 We use our cash flows to fund our operations and investments in our business, including maintenance and improvements, communications site construction, managed network installations and acquisitions. Additionally, we use our cash flows to make distributions, including distributions of our REIT taxable income to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We may also repay or repurchase our existing indebtedness or equity from time to time. We typically fund our international expansion efforts primarily through a combination of cash on hand, intercompany debt and equity contributions. In July 2022, in connection with the funding of the CoreSite Acquisition, we entered into an agreement pursuant to which certain investment vehicles affiliated with Stonepeak acquired a noncontrolling ownership interest in our U.S. data center business. The transaction was completed in August 2022 for total aggregate consideration of $2.5 billion, through an investment in common equity and mandatorily convertible preferred equity. In October 2022, we entered into an agreement with Stonepeak for Stonepeak to acquire additional common equity and mandatorily preferred equity interests in our U.S. data center business for total aggregate consideration of $570.0 million. The transaction was completed in October 2022. We expect to pay distributions related to the outstanding common equity and mandatorily convertible preferred equity.As of December 31, 2022, we hold a common equity interest of approximately 72% in our U.S. data center business, with Stonepeak holding approximately 28% of the outstanding common equity and 100% of the outstanding mandatorily convertible 40Table of Contents preferred equity. On a fully converted basis, which is expected to occur four years from the date of the initial closing in August 2022, and on the basis of the currently outstanding equity, we will hold a controlling ownership interest of approximately 64%, with Stonepeak holding approximately 36%. The mandatorily convertible preferred equity, which accrues dividends at 5.0%, will convert into common equity on a one for one basis, subject to adjustment that will be measured on the conversion date.As of December 31, 2022, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $38.9 billion, with a current portion of $4.5 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations, together with borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from our equity and debt issuances and cash on hand, to fund our acquisitions, capital expenditures and debt service obligations, as well as our required distributions. We believe the cash generated by operating activities during the year ending December 31, 2023, together with our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our required distributions, capital expenditures, debt service obligations (interest and principal repayments) and signed acquisitions.As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022, we had $244.6 million of cash and cash equivalents held by our joint ventures, of which $223.7 million was held by our foreign joint ventures. While certain subsidiaries may pay us interest or principal on intercompany debt, it has not been our practice to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs. However, in the event that we do repatriate any funds, we may be required to accrue and pay certain taxes.Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesFor the year ended December 31, 2022, cash provided by operating activities decreased $1,123.7 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The primary factors that impacted cash provided by operating activities as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, include:•A decrease in unearned revenue due to advance payments from a customer during the year ended December 31, 2021;•An increase in cash required for working capital, primarily as a result of an increase in prepaid and other assets and a decrease in accounts payable;•An increase of approximately $297.4 million in cash paid for interest; and•An increase of approximately $97.1 million in cash paid for taxes.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesOur significant investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 are highlighted below: •We spent approximately $549.0 million for acquisitions, including payments made for acquisitions completed in 2021.•We spent $1.9 billion for capital expenditures, as follows (in millions):Discretionary capital projects (1)$865.8 Ground lease purchases (2)195.7 Capital improvements and corporate expenditures (3)185.6 Redevelopment398.2 Start-up capital projects257.2 Total capital expenditures (4)$1,902.5 _______________(1)Includes the construction of 6,890 communications sites globally and approximately $330 million of spend related to data center assets.(2)Includes $36.7 million of perpetual land easement payments reported in Deferred financing costs and other financing activities in the cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.(3)Includes $6.7 million of finance lease payments reported in Repayments of notes payable, credit facilities, term loans, senior notes, secured debt and finance leases in the cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.(4)Net of purchase credits of $14.5 million on certain assets, which are reported in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We plan to continue to allocate our available capital, after satisfying our distribution requirements, among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria, while maintaining our commitment to our long-term financial policies.

If we redeem the Notes on or after the par call date, we will not be required to pay a make-whole premium.If we undergo a change of control and corresponding ratings decline, each as defined in the supplemental indenture for the Notes, we may be required to repurchase all of the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if any), up to but not including the repurchase date. The Notes rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries.The supplemental indenture contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and our (together with our subsidiaries’) ability to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that we and our subsidiaries may incur certain liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness if the aggregate amount of indebtedness secured by such liens does not exceed 3.5x Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the supplemental indenture.Repayment of CoreSite Debt—On January 7, 2022, we repaid the entire amount outstanding under the CoreSite Debt, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, January 7, 2022, for an aggregate redemption price of $962.9 million, including $80.1 million of prepayment consideration and $7.8 million in accrued and unpaid interest.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, we borrowed an aggregate of $850.0 million and repaid an aggregate of $1.4 billion of revolving indebtedness under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility. We used the borrowings to repay outstanding indebtedness, including the CoreSite Debt, and for general corporate purposes.43Table of Contents 2021 Credit Facility—As of December 31, 2022, we had the ability to borrow up to $4.0 billion under our $4.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, as amended and restated in December 2021 (the “2021 Credit Facility”), which includes a $2.5 billion sublimit for multicurrency borrowings, $200.0 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $50.0 million sublimit for swingline loans.

On June 10, 2022, we repaid $2.3 billion of indebtedness under the 2021 USD 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan using proceeds from the June 2022 common stock offering (as further discussed in note 14) and cash on hand. On August 11, 2022, we repaid all remaining amounts outstanding under the 2021 USD 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan using proceeds from the initial closing of the Stonepeak Transaction.As of December 31, 2022, the key terms under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility, our $1.0 billion unsecured term loan, as amended and restated in December 2021 (the “2021 Term Loan”), our 825.0 million EUR unsecured term loan, as amended in December 2021 (the “2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan”) and our $1.5 billion unsecured term loan entered into in December 2021 (the “2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan”) were as follows: Bank Facility Outstanding Principal BalanceMaturity DateLIBOR or EURIBOR borrowing interest rate range (1)Base rate borrowing interest rate range (1)Current margin over LIBOR or EURIBOR and the base rate, respectively2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility(2)$3,788.7 June 30, 2025(3)0.875% - 1.750%0.000% - 0.750%1.125% and 0.125%2021 Credit Facility(4)1,080.0 January 31, 2027(3)0.875% - 1.750%0.000% - 0.750%1.125% and 0.125%2021 Term Loan(4)1,000.0 January 31, 20270.875% - 1.750%0.000% - 0.750%1.125% and 0.125%2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan(5)883.2 May 28, 20240.875% - 1.625%0.000% - 0.625%1.125% and 0.125%2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan(4)1,500.0 December 28, 20230.875% - 1.750%0.000% - 0.750%1.125% and 0.125%_______________(1)Represents interest rate above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings, interest rate above Euro Interbank Offer Rate (“EURIBOR”) for EURIBOR based borrowings and interest rate above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on our debt ratings.

The commitment fee for the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility and the 2021 Credit Facility ranges from 0.080% to 0.300% per annum, based upon our debt ratings, and is currently 0.110%. The 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility, the 2021 Term Loan, the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan and the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan do not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. We have the option of choosing either a defined base rate, LIBOR or EURIBOR as the applicable base rate for borrowings under these bank facilities.The loan agreements for each of the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility, the 2021 Term Loan, the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan and the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan contain certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply. Failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreements could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facilities, but may constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding under the applicable agreement, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. Nigeria Letters of Credit—During the year ended December 31, 2022, we drew on letters of credit in Nigeria (the “Nigeria Letters of Credit”). The drawn amounts bear interest at a rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate at the time of drawing plus a spread. Amounts are due 270 days from the date of drawing. As of December 31, 2022, we had $16.2 million outstanding under the drawn Nigeria Letters of Credit.44Table of Contents India IndebtednessIndia Working Capital Facilities—The India indebtedness includes several working capital facilities, most of which are subject to annual renewal. The working capital facilities bear interest at rates that consist of the applicable bank’s Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate or Market Benchmark (as defined in the applicable agreement), plus a spread. Generally, the working capital facilities are payable on demand prior to maturity. As of December 31, 2022, we have not borrowed under these facilities. Amounts outstanding and key terms of the India indebtedness consisted of the following as of December 31, 2022 (in millions, except percentages):Amount Outstanding (INR)Amount Outstanding (USD)Interest Rate (Range)Maturity Date (Range)Working capital facilities (1)— $— 8.03% - 8.80%February 4, 2023 - October 22, 2023_______________(1) 7.9 billion INR ($95.6 million) of borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2022. We have 0.2 billion INR (approximately $2.6 million) of of bank guarantees outstanding included within the overall borrowing capacity.India Term Loan—On February 16, 2023, we entered into a 12.0 billion INR (approximately $145.1 million at the date of signing) unsecured term loan with a maturity date that is one year from the date of the first draw thereunder (the “India Term Loan”). On February 17, 2023, we borrowed 10.0 billion INR (approximately $120.7 million at the date of borrowing) under the India Term Loan. The India Term Loan bears interest at the three month treasury bill rate as announced by the Financial Benchmarks India Private Limited at the time of borrowing plus a margin of 1.95%. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The India Term Loan does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium.Stock Repurchase Programs— We have two stock repurchase programs, the 2011 Buyback and the 2017 Buyback. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased 90,042 shares of our common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $18.8 million, including commissions and fees. We had no repurchases under the 2017 Buyback.Under each program, we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions not to exceed market prices and subject to market conditions and other factors. With respect to open market purchases, we may use plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements, which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we may otherwise be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. These programs may be discontinued at any time.We have repurchased a total of 14.5 million shares of our common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $1.5 billion, including commissions and fees. We expect to continue managing the pacing of the remaining approximately $2.0 billion under the Buyback Programs in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors. We expect to fund any further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Repurchases under the Buyback Programs are subject to, among other things, us having available cash to fund the repurchases. Sales of Equity Securities—We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plan, as amended (the “2007 Plan”). During the year ended December 31, 2022, we received an aggregate of $32.4 million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and sales pursuant to the ESPP. 2020 “At the Market” Stock Offering Program—In August 2020, we established an “at the market” stock offering program through which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $1.0 billion (the “2020 ATM Program”). Sales under the 2020 ATM Program may be made by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or, subject to our specific instructions, at negotiated prices. We intend to use the net proceeds from any issuances under the 2020 ATM Program for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, the funding of acquisitions, additions to working capital and repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness. As of December 31, 2022, we have not sold any shares of common stock under the 2020 ATM Program.45Table of Contents Common Stock Offering—On June 7, 2022, we completed a registered public offering of 9,185,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, (which includes the full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option) at $256.00 per share. Aggregate net proceeds from this offering were approximately $2.3 billion after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. We used the net proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under the 2021 USD 364-Day Delayed Draw Term Loan.Future Financing Transactions—We regularly consider various options to access the capital markets, subject to market conditions, to meet our funding needs. Such capital raising alternatives, in addition to those noted above including the 2020 ATM Program, may include additional senior note offerings and securitization transactions. No assurance can be given as to whether any such financing transactions will be completed or as to the timing or terms thereof.Distributions—As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we have distributed, and expect to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income after taking into consideration our utilization of NOLs. We have distributed an aggregate of approximately $14.5 billion to our common stockholders, including the dividend paid in February 2023, primarily classified as ordinary income that may be treated as qualified REIT dividends under Section 199A of the Code for taxable years ending before 2026. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.During the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid $5.69 per share, or $2.6 billion, to common stockholders of record. In addition, we declared a distribution of $1.56 per share, or $726.3 million, paid on February 2, 2023 to our common stockholders of record at the close of business on December 28, 2022.We accrue distributions on unvested restricted stock units, which are payable upon vesting. The amount accrued for distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units was $17.0 million and $12.8 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we paid $6.9 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units. For more details on the cash distributions paid to our common stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2022, see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.Material Cash Requirements—The following table summarizes material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2022 (in millions):20232024202520262027ThereafterTotalDebt obligations (1)$4,514.2 $3,038.6 $7,501.3 $3,336.6 $5,969.2 $14,541.9 $38,901.8 Operating lease obligations (2)1,165.6 1,064.6 1,007.4 947.9 886.6 6,319.8 11,391.9 ______________(1) Includes aggregate principal maturities of long-term debt, including finance lease obligations (see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).(2) Includes payments under non-cancellable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option, which we expect to renew because failure to do so could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases (see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report).Distributions—We expect that our 2023 total distributions declared to our common stockholders will be $3.0 billion. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. Asset Retirement Obligations—We are required to remove our assets and remediate the leased sites upon which certain of our assets are located. As of December 31, 2022, the estimated undiscounted future cash outlay for asset retirement obligations was $4.2 billion. Factors Affecting Sources of LiquidityOur liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities, borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness. We believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants, our compliance with which would be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity.46Table of Contents Internally Generated Funds—Because the majority of our customer leases are multiyear contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2022 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities depends upon the demand for our communications infrastructure and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications infrastructure.Restrictions Under Loan Agreements Relating to Our Credit Facilities—The loan agreements for the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility, the 2021 Term Loan, the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan and the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These restrictions include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage, as set forth in the table below. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. Compliance Tests For The 12 Months Ended December 31, 2022($ in billions)Ratio (1)Additional Debt Capacity Under Covenants (2)Capacity for Adjusted EBITDA Decrease Under Covenants (3)Consolidated Total Leverage RatioTotal Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 7.50:1.00~11.5~1.5Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage RatioSenior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ≤ 3.00:1.00~17.7 (4)~5.9_______________(1) Each component of the ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement.(2) Assumes no change to Adjusted EBITDA.(3) Assumes no change to our debt levels. (4) Effectively, however, additional Senior Secured Debt under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio.Under the terms of the agreements for the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2021 Credit Facility, the 2021 Term Loan, the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan and the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, the Telxius Acquisition and the CoreSite Acquisition were designated as a Qualified Acquisitions, whereby our Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio was adjusted to not exceed 7.50 to 1.00 for four full fiscal quarters following consummation of such acquisitions, which lasted until the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, our Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio stepped back down to not exceed 6.00 to 1.00. The loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants.Failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but may also constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants.Restrictions Under Agreements Relating to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations—The indenture and related supplemental indenture governing the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the “Series 2015-2 Notes”) issued by GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC (“GTP Acquisition Partners”) in the 2015 Securitization and the loan agreement related to the Trust Securitizations include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, GTP Acquisition Partners and American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the “AMT Asset Subs”) are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets, subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the applicable agreements).Under the agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the Series 2015-2 Notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan that secures the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-2A (the “Series 2013-2A Securities”), Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass A (the “Series 2018-1A Securities”), and the 47Table of Contents Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2018-1, Subclass R (the “Series 2018-1R Securities” and, together with the Series 2018-1A Securities, the “2018 Securities”) issued in the Trust Securitizations (the “Loan”), as applicable, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement, subject to the conditions described in the table below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs, as applicable, which can then be distributed to, and used by, us. As of December 31, 2022, $78.4 million held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash. Certain information with respect to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations is set forth below. The debt service coverage ratio (“DSCR”) is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination.

(2) Once triggered, a Cash Trap DSCR condition continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. During a Cash Trap DSCR condition, all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account (the “Cash Trap Reserve Account”) instead of being released to the applicable issuer or borrower. (3) An amortization period commences if the DSCR is equal to or below 1.15x (the “Minimum DSCR”) at the end of any calendar quarter and continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters.(4) No amortization period is triggered if the outstanding principal amount of a series has not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date. However, in such event, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the applicable series, and such series will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow.(5) An amortization period exists if the outstanding principal amount has not been paid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date and continues to exist until such principal has been repaid in full. A failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions and to meet REIT distribution requirements. During an “amortization period,” all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the applicable Cash Trap Reserve Account would be applied to pay the principal of the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, on each monthly payment date, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Further, additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to the Series 2015-2 Notes or subclass of the Loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement. With respect to the Series 2015-2 Notes, upon the occurrence of, and during, an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of the Series 2015-2 Notes, declare the Series 2015-2 Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes. 48Table of Contents Furthermore, if GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs were to default on the Series 2015-2 Notes or the Loan, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 3,516 communications sites that secure the Series 2015-2 Notes or the 5,102 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets that secure the Loan, respectively, in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assets.As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our distribution requirements and repay or repurchase our debt. If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. Further, as further discussed under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” extreme market volatility and disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our ability to raise additional capital through debt financing activities or our ability to repay or refinance maturing liabilities, or impact the terms of any new obligations. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and debt service obligations or refinance our existing indebtedness. In addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and, consequently, a failure by a significant customer to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2022. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.•Impairment of Assets—Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization: We review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable. We review our tower portfolio, network location intangible and right-of-use assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements.We review our tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenant-related intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. Key assumptions included in the undiscounted cash flows are future revenue projections, estimates of ongoing tenancies and operating margins. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment.In October 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued a ruling regarding the definition of AGR and associated fees and charges, which was reaffirmed in March 2020, and again in July 2021 with respect to the total charges, that may have a material financial impact on certain of our customers and could affect their ability to perform their obligations under 49Table of Contents agreements with us. In September 2020, the Supreme Court of India defined the expected timeline of ten years for payments owed under the ruling. In September 2021, the government of India approved a relief package that, among other things, included (i) a four year moratorium on the payment of AGR fees owed and (ii) a change in the definition of AGR on a prospective basis. In the third quarter of 2022, our largest customer in India, VIL, communicated that it would make partial payments of its contractual amounts owed to us and indicated that it would continue to make partial payments for the remainder of 2022. In late 2022, VIL had communicated its intent to resume payments in full under its contractual obligations owed to us beginning on January 1, 2023. However, in early 2023, VIL communicated that it would not be able to resume payments in full of its contractual obligations owed to us, and that it would instead continue to make partial payments. As a result, we determined that certain fixed and intangible assets had been impaired during the year ended December 31, 2022. An impairment of $97.0 million was taken on tower and network location intangible assets in India. We also impaired the tenant-related intangible assets for VIL, which resulted in an impairment of $411.6 million. We will continue to monitor the status of these developments, as it is possible that the estimated future cash flows may differ from current estimates and changes in estimated cash flows from customers in India could have further negative effects on previously recorded tangible and intangible assets, including amounts originally recorded as tenant-related intangible assets, resulting in additional impairments. The carrying value of tenant-related intangible assets in India was $379.5 million as of December 31, 2022, which represents 3% of our consolidated balance of $13.1 billion. Additionally, a significant reduction in customer-related cash flows in India could also impact our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets. The carrying values of our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets in India were $905.8 million and $266.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022, which represent 10% and 8% of our consolidated balances of $8.8 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. •Impairment of Assets—Goodwill: We review goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. We employ a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal revenue growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. We compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. The loss recognized is limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. During the year ended December 31, 2022, no potential goodwill impairment was identified as the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount. The fair value of our India reporting unit, which is based on the present value of forecasted future value cash flows (the income approach), exceeded the carrying value by approximately 24%. Key assumptions include future revenue growth rates and operating margins, capital expenditures, terminal period growth rate and the weighted-average cost of capital, which were determined considering historical data and current assumptions, including uncertainty with respect to amounts owed from VIL (discussed above). For this reporting unit, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that a (i) 5% reduction of projected revenues, (ii) 229 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of capital or (iii) 200% reduction in terminal revenue growth rate, individually, each of which we determined to be reasonable, would impact our conclusion that the fair value of the India reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. Events that could negatively affect our India reporting unit’s financial results include increased tenant attrition exceeding our forecast, additional VIL payment shortfalls, carrier tenant bankruptcies and other factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors.”•Acquisitions: We evaluate each of our acquisitions under the accounting guidance framework to determine whether to treat an acquisition as an asset acquisition or a business combination. For those transactions treated as asset acquisitions, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired, with no recognition of goodwill. For those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, we apply the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with our results from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We continue to evaluate acquisitions accounted for as business combinations for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to replace the asset 50Table of Contents with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future tenant cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition. •Revenue Recognition: Our revenue is derived from leasing the right to use our communications sites, the land on which the sites are located and our data center facilities (the “lease component”) and from the reimbursement of costs incurred in operating the communications sites and supporting the tenants’ equipment as well as other services and contractual rights (the “non-lease component”). Most of our revenue is derived from leasing arrangements and is accounted for as lease revenue unless the timing and pattern of revenue recognition of the non-lease component differs from the lease component. If the timing and pattern of the non-lease component revenue recognition differs from that of the lease component, we separately determine the stand-alone selling prices and pattern of revenue recognition for each performance obligation.Our revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is probable. Escalation clauses tied to a consumer price index or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants, are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total property straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $499.8 million, $465.6 million and $322.0 million, respectively. Amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable lease arrangements. Amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met.We derive the largest portion of our revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, with 46% of our revenues derived from three tenants. In addition, we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. We mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our borrowers and tenants. In recognizing tenant revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and are subsequently determined to present a risk of collection are reserved as bad debt expense. Accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured.•Rent Expense and Lease Accounting: Many of the leases underlying our tower sites and data centers have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time. In addition, certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. Our calculation of the lease liability includes the term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. We recognize a right-of-use lease asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases. The right-of-use asset is measured as the sum of the lease liability, prepaid or accrued lease payments, any initial direct costs incurred and any other applicable amounts.The calculation of the lease liability requires us to make certain assumptions for each lease, including lease term and discount rate implicit in each lease, which could significantly impact the gross lease obligation, the duration and the present value of the lease liability. When calculating the lease term, we consider the renewal, cancellation and termination rights available to us and the lessor. We determine the discount rate by calculating the incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis at the commencement of a lease or upon a change in the lease term.•Income Taxes: Accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes. To the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes, deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is 51Table of Contents recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We do not expect to pay federal income taxes on our REIT taxable income.We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes, if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability.We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination, which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit.Accounting Standards UpdateFor a discussion of recent accounting standards updates, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe following table provides information as of December 31, 2022 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates.

These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of $500.0 million, have an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expire in June 2023.Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2022 consisted of $3.8 billion under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, $1.1 billion under the 2021 Credit Facility, $1.0 52Table of Contents billion under the 2021 Term Loan, $883.2 million under the 2021 EUR Three Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, $1.5 billion under the 2021 USD Two Year Delayed Draw Term Loan, $500.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 3.000% Notes and $16.2 million under the Nigeria Letters of Credit. A 10% increase in current interest rates would result in an additional $42.4 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022. Foreign Currency RiskWe are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar is reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 43% of our revenues and 52% of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies.As of December 31, 2022, we have incurred intercompany debt that is not considered to be permanently reinvested, and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As this debt had not been designated as being a long-term investment in nature, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. An adverse change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in $40.5 million of unrealized losses that would be included in Other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we have 7.3 billion EUR (approximately $7.8 billion) denominated debt outstanding. An adverse change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our outstanding EUR debt would result in $0.9 billion of foreign currency losses that would be included in Other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022.",2023-12-30 19:22:50.998924
1053507,AMT,AMERICAN TOWER CORP /MA/,2004,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures in our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the heading “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” on page 38. Our continuing operations are reported in two segments, rental and management and network development services. Management focuses on segment profit (loss) as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments. We define segment operating profit (loss) as segment revenues less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization; corporate general, administrative and development expense; and impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets and restructuring expense. Segment profit (loss) for the rental and management segment includes interest income, TV Azteca, net (see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements). In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the consolidated statements of operations for periods presented in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” have been adjusted to reflect certain businesses as discontinued operations (see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements). Executive Overview Our principal operating segment is our rental and management segment, which accounted for approximately 86.7% and 80.7% of our total revenues and approximately 98.4% and 96.6% of our segment operating profit for the years ending December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The primary factors affecting the stability and growth of our revenues and cash flows for this segment are our recurring revenues from existing tenant leases and the contractual escalators in those leases, leasing additional space on our existing towers, and acquiring and building additional tower sites. We continue to believe that our leasing revenue is likely to grow more rapidly than revenue from our network development services segment due to our strategic focus on our rental and management segment, the continuing growth in the use of wireless communications services and our ability to utilize existing tower capacity. In addition, we believe the majority of our leasing activity will continue to come from broadband-services customers. The majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are for an initial term of five to ten years (fifteen to twenty for broadcast tenants). Accordingly, a significant majority of the revenue generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of December 2003 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. In addition, most of our leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease. These contractual escalators are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage (generally three to five percent), inflation, or a fixed percentage plus inflation. Rate increases based on fixed escalation clauses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the applicable agreement. The primary factor affecting our ability to lease additional space on our existing towers is the rate at which wireless carriers choose to deploy capital to improve and expand their networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and the infrastructure needed to support these services, the financial performance of our customers and their access to capital, and general economic conditions. In 2003, our revenue growth on towers that existed during the entire period beginning January 1, 2002 and ending December 31, 2003, was approximately $50.0 million. Based on our understanding of our customers’ capital spending and network development plans, we do not expect these trends will change materially in 2004. 22 Table of Contents In 2002 and 2003, we acquired or constructed 580 and 618 towers, respectively. Because of the nature of our recurring revenues described above, our results of operations only reflect revenues generated by the acquired and newly constructed tower sites following their respective dates of acquisition or construction, which affects year-to-year comparisons. For the year ending December 31, 2003, approximately $28.0 million of our revenue was attributable to towers that we acquired or constructed in 2002, and approximately $16.0 million of our revenue was attributable to towers that we acquired or constructed in 2003. Our rental and management segment operating expenses are comprised of two major categories: direct tower level expenses and allocable selling, general and administrative expenses. Our direct tower level expenses consist primarily of ground rent, maintenance, taxes and utilities. Because our operating expenses generally do not increase significantly when we add additional customers on a tower site, leasing space to new customers on our existing sites provides significant incremental cash flow. Our profit margin growth is, therefore, directly related to the number of new tenants added to our existing tower sites and the related rental revenue generated in a particular period. Our selling, general and administrative expenses have two major components. The first component consists of expenses necessary to support our site leasing and network development services such as sales and property management functions. The second component consists of expenses incurred to support all of our operations, such as legal, accounting, human resources and other administrative support. In connection with organizational initiatives in 2002 and 2003 to manage our operations more efficiently, these expenses have decreased over these periods, and we expect them to be relatively stable in 2004.

The increase resulted from an increase in rental and management revenues of $74.8 million, offset by a decrease in network development services revenue of $34.7 million. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $619.7 million, an increase of $74.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase resulted primarily from adding additional broadband tenants to towers that existed as of January 1, 2002 and, to a lesser extent, from revenue generated on the approximately 1,200 towers acquired and/or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2002. We continue to believe that our leasing revenue, which drives our core business, is likely to grow more rapidly than revenue from our network development services segment due to our expected increase in utilization of existing tower capacity. In addition, we believe that the majority of our leasing activity will continue to come from broadband type customers. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $95.4 million, a decrease of $34.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The decline in revenues during 2003 resulted primarily from decreases in revenue related to construction management, installation and tower maintenance services, resulting from lower levels of construction activity and reduced demand for related services in the wireless telecommunications industry. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $683.7 million, a decrease of $106.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The principal components of the decrease were attributable to expense decreases in our network development services segment of $29.6 million and a decrease in impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets and restructuring expense of $69.7 million. The remaining components of the decrease were attributable to decreases in expenses within our rental and management segment of $4.1 million and a decrease in corporate general, administrative and development expense of $3.4 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $222.7 million, a decrease of $4.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in certain rental and management segment overhead costs, partially offset by an increase in tower expenses related to the 1,200 towers we have acquired/constructed since January 1, 2002 due to their inclusion in our results for a full year in 2003. Rental and management segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $411.2 million, an increase of $79.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase resulted primarily from incremental revenues and operating profit from adding additional broadband tenants to existing towers and newly acquired and/or constructed towers, coupled with a net reduction in tower expenses, as discussed above. Network Development Services Expense/Segment Profit Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $88.9 million, a decrease of $29.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The majority of the decrease was due to an overall decline in demand for the services performed by this segment, as discussed above, partially offset by decreases in overhead and related infrastructure costs. 24 Table of Contents Network development services segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $6.5 million, a decrease of $5.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease resulted primarily from a decline in revenue, as discussed above, partially offset by expense reductions, as discussed above. Corporate General, Administrative and Development Expense Corporate general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $26.9 million, a decrease of $3.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in development expense as a result of our curtailed acquisition and development related activities. Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long-Lived Assets and Restructuring Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets and restructuring expense was $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we sold approximately 300 non-core towers and certain other non-core assets and recorded impairment charges to write-down certain other non-core towers and assets. As a result, we recorded impairment charges and net loss on sale of long-lived assets of approximately $19.1 million. We also wrote-off approximately $9.2 million of construction-in-progress costs, primarily associated with sites we no longer planned to build. Lastly, we incurred employee separation costs (primarily associated with the reorganization of certain functions in our rental and management segment) and facility closing costs aggregating $3.4 million. Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets and restructuring expense was $101.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. During the year-ended December 31, 2002, we sold approximately 720 non-core towers and recorded impairment charges to write-down certain other non-core towers, which resulted in aggregate impairment charges and net losses of approximately $46.8 million. In September 2002, we reduced the scope of our new tower construction and build plans for the remainder of 2002 and 2003 and, as a result, we wrote-off approximately $40.2 million of construction-in-progress costs for the year ended December 31, 2002 associated with sites we no longer planned to build. Additionally, in the latter stages of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002, we announced a restructuring of our organization to include the centralization of certain operational and administrative functions. As a result of these initiatives, during the year ended December 31, 2002, we incurred employee separation costs associated with the termination of approximately 460 employees (primarily development and administrative), as well as costs associated with the termination of lease obligations and other incremental facility closing costs, aggregating $10.6 million. Interest Income Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $5.3 million, an increase of $1.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in interest earned on restricted cash and investments, resulting principally from our 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes offering in January 2003 and, to a lesser extent, our August 2003 equity offering. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $279.9 million, an increase of $25.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase resulted primarily from the following: interest expense on our 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes, issued in January 2003; our 3.25% convertible notes, issued in August 2003; the ATI 7.25% senior subordinated notes, issued in November 2003. The increase was partially offset by a net decrease in interest expense on our credit facilities as a result of repayments made during 2003 and, to a lesser extent, lower interest rates. The increase was also partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on our 2.25% and 5.0% convertible notes as a result of repurchases made during 2003 (as discussed below). 25 Table of Contents Loss on Retirement of Long-Term Obligations During the year ended December 31, 2003, we amended our credit facilities and made certain prepayments and unscheduled principal payments on the term loans thereunder, which collectively reduced the borrowing capacity under our credit facilities. As a result, we recorded an aggregate charge of approximately $11.9 million related to the write-off of deferred financing fees associated with the reduction in our overall borrowing capacity. We also repurchased certain of our 2.25% convertible and 5.0% convertible notes (inclusive of the cash tender offer for our 2.25% convertible notes that expired on October 22, 2003) throughout the year. As a result, we incurred an aggregate charge of approximately $34.3 million, which primarily represented the fair market value of the shares of stock issued to our 2.25% convertible note holders in excess of the shares originally issuable upon conversion of the notes, offset by a net gain on the repurchases of our 5.0% convertible notes. The total of these charges, $46.2 million, represents our loss on retirement of long-term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2003. In February 2002, we repaid $95.0 million outstanding under our Mexican credit facility with borrowings under our credit facilities. As a result of such repayment, for the year ended December 31, 2002, we expensed approximately $1.7 million of deferred financing fees. In addition, in January 2002, we terminated the $250.0 million multi-draw term loan C component of our credit facilities and recorded a non-cash charge of approximately $7.2 million related to the write-off of related deferred financing fees. The total of these charges, $8.9 million, represents our loss on retirement of long-term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2002. Loss on Investments and Other Expense Loss on investments and other expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $29.8 million, an increase of $4.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase resulted primarily from fees and expenses incurred in connection with a financing transaction that we did not consummate as a result of the ATI 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes offering. This increase was primarily offset by decreased foreign currency transaction losses. We recorded impairment charges on our cost and equity investments, as well as losses on our equity method investments, aggregating $21.2 million and $20.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Income Tax Benefit The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $66.1 million, a decrease of $1.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The effective tax rate was 21.4% for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to 17.5% for the year ended December 31, 2002. The primary reason for the increase in the effective tax rate is a result of a $27.5 million valuation allowance that we recorded in 2002 in connection with our tax planning strategy to carry back approximately $380.0 million of federal net operating losses generated prior to 2003. This strategy resulted in the filing of tax refund claims with the IRS in 2003. In June 2003, we filed an income tax refund claim with the IRS relating to carrying back net operating losses that we generated in 1998, 1999 and 2001. We filed a similar claim in October 2003, with respect to net operating losses generated in 2002. We anticipate receiving a refund of approximately $90.0 million as a result of these claims, which will monetize a portion of our deferred tax asset. We estimate recovery of these amounts within one to three years of the dates the claims were filed with the IRS. There can be no assurances, however, with respect to the specific amount and timing of the refund. The valuation allowance represents the estimated lost tax benefit and costs incurred in connection with implementing this strategy. This increase was offset in part by an increase in the valuation allowance in 2003 for capital losses and non-deductible losses on retirements of our convertible notes. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to our capital losses, foreign items and non-deductible losses on retirements of our convertible notes. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to our capital losses, foreign items and the valuation allowance recorded in connection with our tax planning strategy discussed above. 26 Table of Contents SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” requires that we record a valuation allowance when it is “more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.” At December 31, 2003, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $156.7 million primarily related to net state deferred tax assets, capital loss carryforwards and the lost tax benefit and costs associated with the tax refund claims. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our tax refund claims and our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as management believes that we will be successful with our tax refund claims and will have sufficient time to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty-year tax carryforward period. We intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset through our tax refund claims discussed above. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state (no growth) projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments reducing interest expense. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2003 will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $1.0 billion in taxable income from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2023. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future, or carry back losses, as described below, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense, which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders’ equity. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net In December 2002, we committed to a plan to sell Verestar by December 31, 2003. In December 2003, Verestar filed for bankruptcy protection and ceased to be included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In August 2003, we consummated the sale of Galaxy. In June 2003, we committed to a plan to sell Kline by June 30, 2004. In May 2003, we consummated the sale of an office building in Westwood, Massachusetts. In February 2003, pursuant to our original plan to sell Verestar, we sold MTN, a subsidiary of Verestar. In January 2003, we sold Flash Technologies. In March 2003, we consummated the sale of an office building in Schaumburg, Illinois. In December 2002, we consummated the sale of the building in Boston, Massachusetts where we maintain our corporate headquarters. Finally, in July 2002, we consummated the sale of MTS Components. Accordingly, we have presented the results of these operations (including those of Verestar through the date of the bankruptcy filing), approximately $(12.5) million and $(245.2) million, net of tax, in loss from discontinued operations, net, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition to the above, loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes the following: (a) an aggregate impairment charge of $26.5 million to reduce the carrying amount of our investment in Verestar to zero and to record our estimate of costs that we may incur under certain of Verestar’s contracts for which we are primarily or secondarily liable as a guarantor as of December 31, 2003; (b) an aggregate non-cash impairment charge of $14.6 million to reduce the carrying value of Kline’s net assets to the estimated proceeds expected upon disposal; (c) a $2.4 million net loss on the disposal of Galaxy; (d) a $3.6 million net loss on the disposal of the office building in Westwood, Massachusetts; (e) a $0.1 million net gain on the sale of Flash Technologies; and (f) a $0.1 million net loss on the sale of the office building in Schaumberg, Illinois. Loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2002 includes an aggregate net loss on our disposition of MTS Components and two office buildings of approximately $13.5 million. As of December 31, 2003, the disposal of our Kline business was still a pending transaction. In March 2004, we sold substantially all the net assets of Kline and expect to sell the remaining assets by June 30, 2004. 27 Table of Contents Cumulative Effective of Change in Accounting Principle, Net As of January 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” As a result, we recognized a $562.6 million non-cash charge (net of a tax benefit of $14.4 million) as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the write-down of goodwill to its fair value. The non-cash charge was comprised of goodwill within our former satellite and fiber network access services segment ($189.3 million) and network development services segment ($387.8 million). In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, the charge is reflected as of January 1, 2002 and included in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. Years Ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 Year Ended December 31, Amount of Increase (Decrease) Percent Increase (Decrease) 2002 2001 (In thousands) REVENUES: Rental and management $ 544,906 $ 431,051 $ 113,855 26 % Network development services 130,176 223,926 (93,750 ) (42 ) Total revenues 675,082 654,977 20,105 3 OPERATING EXPENSES: Rental and management 226,786 209,923 16,863 8 Network development services 118,591 199,568 (80,977 ) (41 ) Depreciation and amortization 312,866 334,917 (22,051 ) (7 ) Corporate general, administrative and development expense 30,229 34,310 (4,081 ) (12 ) Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets and restructuring expense 101,372 79,496 21,876 28 Total operating expenses 789,844 858,214 (68,370 ) (8 ) OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest income, TV Azteca, net 13,938 14,377 (439 ) (3 ) Interest income 3,496 28,372 (24,876 ) (88 ) Interest expense (254,446 ) (267,199 ) (12,753 ) (5 ) Loss on investments and other expense (25,559 ) (38,795 ) (13,236 ) (34 ) Loss on retirement of long-term obligations (8,869 ) (26,336 ) (17,467 ) (66 ) Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries (2,118 ) (318 ) 1,800 566 Income tax benefit 67,783 102,032 (34,249 ) (34 ) Loss from discontinued operations, net (258,724 ) (58,990 ) 199,734 339 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net (562,618 ) 562,618 N/A Net loss $ (1,141,879 ) $ (450,094 ) $ 691,785 154 % Total Revenues Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $675.1 million, an increase of $20.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase resulted from an increase in rental and management revenues of $113.9 million, offset by a decrease in network development services revenue of $93.8 million. 28 Table of Contents Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $544.9 million, an increase of $113.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase resulted primarily from leasing activity on towers acquired and constructed subsequent to January 1, 2001 and, to a lesser extent, increased revenue on towers that existed as of January 1, 2001. The 4,270 towers that we have acquired and constructed since January 1, 2001 have significantly increased our revenues. The increased depth and strength of our national and international portfolio provided us with a much larger base of tower revenue for a full year in 2002 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2001. The remaining component of the increase is attributable to an increase in same tower revenue related to towers included in our portfolio as of January 1, 2001. This increase was driven by our ability to market and add additional tenants to those towers. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $130.2 million, a decrease of $93.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The significant decline in revenues during 2002 resulted primarily from decreases in revenue related to construction management, installation and tower maintenance services, resulting from a corresponding decrease in the growth of the wireless telecommunications industry. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $789.8 million, a decrease of $68.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The principal component of the decrease was attributable to expense decreases in our network development services segment of $81.0 million. The remaining components of the decrease were attributable to a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of $22.1 million and a decrease in corporate general, administrative and development expense of $4.1 million. These decreases were offset by increases in expenses within our rental and management segment of $16.9 million, coupled with an increase in impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets and restructuring expense of $21.9 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $226.8 million, an increase of $16.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The majority of the increase resulted from incremental operating expenses incurred in 2002 for the more than 3,700 towers that were acquired or constructed during 2001 (due to a full year of inclusion in our results of operations in 2002). The balance of the increase reflects operating expenses incurred in 2002 for the more than 570 towers acquired/constructed in 2002. These increases were partially offset by cost reduction efforts in administrative and operational functions. Rental and management segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $332.1 million, an increase of $96.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The increase resulted primarily from incremental revenues and operating profit from both newly acquired and constructed towers and existing towers. Network Development Services Expense/Segment Profit Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $118.6 million, a decrease of $81.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The majority of the decrease was due to an overall decline in demand for the services performed by this segment, as discussed above, coupled with decreases in overhead and related infrastructure costs. Network development services segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $11.6 million, a decrease of $12.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease resulted primarily from a decline in revenue, as discussed above, partially offset by a reduction in personnel, overhead and infrastructure costs as a result of restructuring initiatives that were implemented in 2002 and 2001. 29 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $312.9 million, a decrease of $22.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease reflects the adoption of SFAS No. 142, which reduced amortization expense by approximately $67.6 million. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense related to acquisitions and capital expenditures of approximately $236.9 million in 2002 and a full year of depreciation on the $1.4 billion of property and equipment acquired in 2001. Corporate General, Administrative and Development Expense Corporate general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $30.2 million, a decrease of $4.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease is attributable to cost reduction efforts in administrative and information technology functions related to our restructuring initiatives, as well as a reduction in development expense as a result of our curtailed acquisition and development related activities. Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long-Lived Assets and Restructuring Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets and restructuring expense was $101.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. During the year ended December 31, 2002, we sold approximately 720 non-core towers and recorded impairment charges to write-down certain other non-core towers, which resulted in aggregate impairment charges and net losses of approximately $46.8 million. In September 2002, we reduced the scope of our new tower construction and build plans for the remainder of 2002 and 2003 and, as a result, we wrote-off approximately $40.2 million of construction-in-progress costs for the year ended December 31, 2002 associated with sites we no longer planned to build. Lastly, during the year ended December 31, 2002, we incurred employee separation costs associated with the termination of approximately 460 employees (primarily development and administrative), as well as costs associated with the termination of lease obligations and other incremental facility closing costs aggregating $10.6 million. Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets and restructuring expense was $79.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. In November 2001, we announced a restructuring of our organization to include a reduction in the scope of our tower development and acquisition activities and the centralization of certain operational and administrative functions. This resulted in a significant decrease in new tower construction and more stringent criteria for evaluating tower construction and acquisitions. As a result, we wrote-off approximately $62.6 million of construction-in-progress costs for the year ended December 31, 2001 associated with sites we no longer planned to build. We also incurred impairment charges to write-down certain non-core towers of approximately $11.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2001. Lastly, we incurred employee separation costs associated with the termination of approximately 525 employees (primarily tower development and administrative), as well as facility closing costs, aggregating $5.2 million. Interest Income Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $3.5 million, a decrease of $24.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in interest earned on invested cash primarily attributable to a decrease in cash on hand during 2002, coupled with lower interest rates. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $254.4 million, a decrease of $12.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The majority of the decrease, $26.6 million, resulted primarily from a reduction in the interest rates under our credit facilities. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $7.6 million related to a full year of interest incurred on our 9 3/8% senior notes (issued in January 2001) and a reduction in capitalized interest as a result of our reduced capital expenditures in 2002. 30 Table of Contents Loss on Investments and Other Expense Loss on investments and other expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $25.6 million, a decrease of $13.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease resulted primarily from decreased impairment and equity losses on our cost and equity investments, offset by increased losses on foreign currency exchange related to our Mexican subsidiary. Loss from Retirement of Long-Term Obligations In February 2002, we repaid all amounts outstanding under our Mexican credit facility with borrowings under our credit facility. As a result of such repayment, we expensed approximately $1.7 million of deferred financing fees. In addition, in January 2002, we terminated the $250.0 million multi-draw term loan C component of our credit facilities and recorded a non-cash charge of approximately $7.2 million related to the write-off of the related deferred financing fees. The aggregate of these charges, $8.9 million, represents our loss on retirement of long-term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2002. During the year ended December 31, 2001, we acquired a portion of our 2.25% convertible notes in exchange for shares of our Class A common stock. As a consequence of those negotiated exchanges with certain of our noteholders, we recorded a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $26.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This non-cash charge represents the fair value of incremental stock issued to note holders to induce them to convert their holdings prior to the first scheduled redemption date. Income Tax Benefit The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $67.8 million, a decrease of $34.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2001. The effective tax rate was 17.5% for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to 20.7% for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a valuation allowance of $27.5 million that we recorded in 2002 in connection with our tax planning strategy to carry back certain federal net operating losses. The valuation allowance represents the estimated lost tax benefit and costs associated with implementing such strategy. This decrease is offset by the impact of our ceasing to amortize goodwill (the majority of which is non-deductible for tax purposes) in 2002 in connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations in 2002 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to valuation allowances related to our capital losses, tax planning strategy (as discussed above) and foreign items. The effective tax rate in 2001 differs from the federal statutory rate due to valuation allowances related to capital losses and other non-deductible items consisting principally of goodwill amortization, and to a lesser extent, note conversion expense. SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” requires that we record a valuation allowance when it is “more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.” At December 31, 2002, we have provided a valuation allowance primarily related to state net operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards and the lost tax benefit and costs associated with our tax refund claims. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily federal net operating loss carryforwards, as management believes that we will have sufficient time to realize these assets during the twenty-year tax carryforward period. We intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset through our tax planning strategy, which carries back certain federal net operating losses. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state (no growth) projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward 31 Table of Contents period and debt repayments reducing interest expense. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2002 will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $800.0 million in taxable income from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2022. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future, or carry back losses as described above, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense, which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders’ equity. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net In December 2002, we committed to a plan to dispose of our wholly owned subsidiary Verestar by sale by December 31, 2003. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we also committed to a plan to sell Flash Technologies and two office buildings held primarily as rental property. In July 2002, we consummated the sale of our MTS Components operations. In the first quarter of 2003, we committed to a plan to sell an office building in Westwood, Massachusetts held primarily as rental property. In the second quarter of 2003, we committed to a plan to sell Kline by June 30, 2004. In August 2003, we consummated the sale of Galaxy. Accordingly, we presented the results of these operations, approximately $(245.2) million and $(59.0) million, net of tax, in loss from discontinued operations, net, in the accompanying statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2002 also includes a net loss on our disposition of MTS Components and two office buildings of approximately $13.5 million, net of a tax benefit. Cumulative Effective of Change in Accounting Principle, Net As of January 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” As a result, we recognized a $562.6 million non-cash charge (net of a tax benefit of $14.4 million) as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the write-down of goodwill to its fair value. The non-cash charge was comprised of goodwill within our former satellite and fiber network access services segment ($189.3 million) and network development services segment ($387.8 million). In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, the charge is reflected as of January 1, 2002 and included in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. 32 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview In 2003, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and cash interest obligations. We believe cash flow from operations for the year ending December 31, 2004 also will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and our cash debt service (interest and principal repayments) obligations for 2004. For information about our outstanding indebtedness, see “—Contractual Obligations” below. We expect our 2004 cash needs to consist primarily of the following: debt service, including cash interest of approximately $195.0 million, the repayment of approximately $75.8 million of term loans under our credit facilities and capital lease payments and other notes payable of $5.5 million; capital expenditures of between $50.0 and $65.0 million, principally related to new tower construction and improvements to existing towers; and tower acquisitions of approximately $31.4 million. We expect to meet these cash needs through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and proceeds from sales of non-core assets. Due to the risk factors outlined in “Business—Factors That May Affect Future Results,” however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our cash needs without additional borrowings under our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2003, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $3.4 billion. We incurred substantially all of this indebtedness prior to 2002 in order to fund the acquisition of communications sites and services businesses (expenditures for such acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 were $1.4 billion and $812.8 million, respectively), and capital expenditures related to the construction of new communications sites (capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 were $541.3 million and $568.2 million, respectively). Beginning in 2002, we significantly reduced our acquisitions and new tower construction activities, and began to focus on reducing our overall indebtedness. In 2003, we continued this trend by reducing our net total indebtedness (the combined decrease in outstanding indebtedness and the increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and investments) by approximately $235.5 million. We also improved our financial flexibility by opportunistically refinancing approximately $1.0 billion of our indebtedness to extend maturity dates. We plan to continue to reduce our overall indebtedness in 2004 and beyond with cash flow from operations, and may opportunistically further reduce indebtedness and interest expense through future capital market or strategic transactions. Uses of Cash Tower Construction, Improvement and Acquisition. Historically, we have used available cash and proceeds from non-core asset sales, including cash obtained from our credit facilities and proceeds from the sale of our debt and equity securities, to fund the construction, improvement and acquisition of tower assets. In 2002, we began to reduce our capital expenditures on new tower development. As a result, we significantly reduced our capital expenditures on new tower development in 2003 from historical levels (for example, our capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were $61.6 million in 2003 as compared to $180.5 million and $568.2 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively), and we expect this trend to continue. Accordingly, we expect that our cash needs in 2004 for tower development, improvement and acquisition will be funded out of cash from operations and proceeds from asset dispositions. • Construction and Improvements. Capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were approximately $61.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. We anticipate that we will build between 120 and 160 new towers through the end of 2004, and expect our 2004 total capital expenditures for construction and improvements to be between approximately $44.0 million and $58.0 million. In addition, we expect to incur approximately $6.0 to $7.0 million in capital expenditures relating to our services division and corporate infrastructure. 33 Table of Contents • Acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we acquired approximately $95.1 million in tower assets. As of December 31, 2003, we were obligated to make capital expenditures to acquire up to approximately $31.4 million of tower assets, of which approximately $10.3 million had been acquired as of March 5, 2004. We plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that can provide the highest potential returns in light of existing market conditions. Accordingly, we may continue to acquire tower sites, build new tower sites and redevelop or improve existing tower sites when the expected returns on such investments meet our investment criteria. Debt Service. As of December 31, 2003, we had outstanding debt of approximately $3.4 billion. For the year ending December 31, 2004, we are obligated to make a total of approximately $276.0 million in cash interest and principal payments on outstanding debt (this amount excludes approximately $82.0 million of non-cash interest expense relating to the accretion of our ATI 12.25% Notes and warrants and the amortization of deferred financing costs). Our cash debt service obligations as of December 31, 2003 are summarized under “—Contractual Obligations” below. Contractual Obligations. The following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations payable in cash as of December 31, 2003 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total Credit facility term loan A (1) $ 73,056 $ 111,459 $ 133,578 $ 71,448 $ 389,541 Credit facility term loan B (1)(2) 2,697 2,697 2,697 258,895 266,986 Credit facility revolver (1) 48,189 48,189 9 3/8% senior notes $ 1,000,000 1,000,000 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes (3) $ 808,000 808,000 7.25% senior subordinated notes 400,000 400,000 5.0% convertible notes (4)(5) 349,413 349,413 6.25% convertible notes (4)(5) 212,742 212,742 3.25% convertible notes 210,000 210,000 2.25% convertible notes 44 44 Long-term obligations, excluding capital leases and other notes payable 75,797 114,156 349,017 727,945 808,000 1,610,000 3,684,915 Cash interest expense (1)(2)(3)(5) 195,000 184,000 172,000 136,000 130,000 103,000 920,000 Capital lease payments (including interest) and other notes payable 5,548 4,635 19,233 3,355 3,215 208,645 244,631 Operating lease payments 87,905 75,104 62,075 52,234 42,591 289,857 609,766 Purchase obligations for acquisitions 31,400 31,400 Other long-term liabilities (6) 1,069 322 329 337 345 3,551 5,953 Total $ 396,719 $ 378,217 $ 602,654 $ 919,871 $ 984,151 $ 2,215,053 $ 5,496,665 A description of our contractual debt obligations is included in Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” as well as in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. (1) Interest on our credit facilities is payable in accordance with the applicable London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option, either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2003 for the credit facilities was 4.25%. For projections of our cash interest expense related to the credit facilities, we have assumed the LIBOR rate, before the margin as defined in our credit facility agreements, is 1.5% through December 31, 2007. (2) In January 2004, we refinanced our $267.0 million term loan B with a new term loan C due December 31, 2007. The new term loan C has substantially the same terms as term loan B, except that the interest rate spreads for the LIBOR and base rate loans were reduced from 3.5% above LIBOR to 2.25% and from 2.5% above the base rate to 1.25%, respectively. 34 Table of Contents (3) The 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes accrue no cash interest. Instead, the accreted value of each note increases between the date of original issuance and maturity (August 1, 2008) at a rate of 12.25% per annum, with principal due at maturity of $808.0 million. As of December 31, 2003, the outstanding debt under the 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes was $424.2 million accreted value, net of the allocated fair value of $44.2 million relating to warrants issued in conjunction with these notes. (4) The holders of our 6.25% and 5.0% convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on specified dates prior to their maturity dates in 2009 and 2010, but we may pay the purchase price by issuing shares of our Class A common stock, subject to certain conditions. The obligations with respect to the right of the holders to put the 6.25% convertible notes and 5.0% convertible notes on October 22, 2006 and February 20, 2007, respectively, have been classified as cash obligations in those respective periods. (5) In February 2004, we sold $225.0 million principal amount of 7.50% senior notes due 2012 through an institutional private placement. The net proceeds of the offering were used to redeem all of our outstanding 6.25% convertible notes and to repurchase $4.5 million of our 5.0% convertible notes. (6) Liabilities that are not payable in cash, primarily our unearned revenue and deferred rent liability, are not included. The above table does not include certain commitments relating to the construction of tower sites under existing build to suit agreements as of December 31, 2003, as we cannot currently estimate the timing and amounts of such payments. (See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.) Sources of Cash Total Liquidity at December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately $544.8 million of total liquidity, which is comprised of approximately $275.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to draw approximately $269.3 million of the revolving loan under our credit facilities. Of the approximately $275.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $170.0 million is held in restrictive accounts and approximately $49.1 million of this amount must be used to repay existing indebtedness. Cash Generated by Operations. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, our cash provided by operating activities was $156.4 million, $105.1 million and $26.1 million, respectively. Each of our rental and management and network development services segments are expected to generate cash flows from operations during 2004 in excess of their cash needs for operations and capital expenditures for tower construction, improvements and acquisitions. We expect to use the excess cash generated from these segments principally to service our debt. Credit Facilities. As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately $269.3 million of unused capacity under our revolving credit facility, the only loan under our credit facilities that is not fully drawn. We have not borrowed any amounts under our credit facilities since April 2002, and we do not anticipate borrowing any amounts under the revolving credit facility during 2004. In February 2004, we made a $21.0 million voluntary prepayment of term loan A under our credit facilities. 35 Table of Contents Proceeds from the Sale of Debt and Equity Securities. During 2003, we raised approximately $1.1 billion in net proceeds from the sale of debt and equity securities as follows: Date Transaction Approximate NetProceeds January 2003 ATI 12.25% Senior Subordinated Discount Notes due 2008 $397.0 million August 2003 $210.0 million 3.25% Convertible Notes due 2010 14,260,000 Shares of Class A common stock $202.8 million $120.3 million November 2003 $400.0 million ATI 7.25% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011 $389.3 million The net proceeds from these offerings were used to repay approximately $961.3 million of existing indebtedness, and approximately $170.0 million remains in restricted cash and investments at December 31, 2003. In addition, during 2003 we issued 8,415,984 shares of our Class A common stock in exchange for an aggregate amount of approximately $53.1 million accreted value ($67.2 million face value) of our 2.25% convertible notes. These exchanges were effected in privately negotiated transactions pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) under the Securities Act of 1933. In February 2004, we raised an additional approximately $221.7 million of net proceeds through an institutional private placement of our 7.50% senior notes due 2012. Approximately $217.1 million of the net proceeds from this offering were used to redeem all of our outstanding 6.25% convertible notes due 2009, and $4.5 million of those proceeds were used to repurchase our 5.0% convertible notes. (See note 19 to our consolidated financial statements.) Divestiture Proceeds. During 2003, we continued to execute our strategy of divesting non-core assets and reinvesting the proceeds of such divestitures in higher return tower assets. From January 1, 2003 to March 5, 2004, we received net proceeds of approximately $123.9 million from non-core asset sales related to the sale of our remaining components business, two office buildings, a Verestar subsidiary, Galaxy, Kline, and non-core towers and related assets. Proceeds from these and any future transactions have and will be used, to the extent permitted under our credit facilities and mortgages, to acquire additional tower assets and to service debt. We anticipate receiving approximately $10.0 million of proceeds from additional sales of non-core assets during 2004. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Internally Generated Funds. The key factors affecting our ability to generate sufficient funds from operations are the demand for antennae space on wireless and broadcast communications towers and for related services, our ability to maximize the utilization of our existing towers and our ability to minimize costs and fully achieve our operating efficiencies. Restrictions Under Credit Facilities and Other Debt Securities. The credit facilities with our borrower subsidiaries contain certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guarantees, use of proceeds from asset sales, dividends and other distributions, investments and liens) with which our borrower subsidiaries and restricted subsidiaries must comply. The credit facilities contain five financial tests with which we must comply: • a leverage ratio (Total Debt to Annualized Operating Cash Flow). As of December 31, 2003, we were required to maintain a ratio of not greater than 5.75 to 1.00, decreasing to 5.50 to 1.00 at January 1, 2004, to 5.25 to 1.00 at April 1, 2004, to 5.00 to 1.00 at July 1, 2004, to 4.75 to 1.00 at October 1, 2004, to 4.50 to 1.00 at January 1, 2005, to 4.25 to 1.00 at April 1, 2005 and to 4.00 to 1.00 at July 1, 2005 and thereafter; 36 Table of Contents • a senior leverage ratio (Senior Debt to Annualized Operating Cash Flow). As of December 31, 2003, we were required to maintain a ratio of not greater than 4.25 to 1.00, decreasing to 4.00 to 1.00 at January 1, 2004, to 3.75 to 1.00 at April 1, 2004, to 3.50 to 1.00 at July 1, 2004, to 3.25 to 1.00 at October 1, 2004 and to 3.00 to 1.00 at January 1, 2005 and thereafter; • a pro forma debt service test (Annualized Operating Cash Flow to Pro Forma Debt Service). As of December 31, 2003, we were required to maintain a ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1.00; • an interest coverage test (Annualized Operating Cash Flow to Interest Expense). As of December 31, 2003, we were required to maintain a ratio of not less than 2.50 to 1.00, increasing to 3.00 to 1.00 at January 1, 2004; and • a fixed charge coverage test (Annualized Operating Cash Flow to Fixed Charges ). As of December 31, 2003, we were required to maintain a ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1.00. Any failure to comply with these covenants would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under our revolving line of credit, but would also constitute a default. These covenants also restrict our ability, as the parent company, to incur any debt other than that currently outstanding and refinancings of that debt. The credit facilities also limit our revolving loan drawdowns based on our cash on hand. In addition to the credit facilities, the indentures governing the terms of the ATI 12.25% Notes and the ATI 7.25% Notes contain certain restrictive covenants with which ATI, the sister guarantors and its and their subsidiaries must comply. These include restrictions on their ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions, make certain investments and, as in the credit facilities, use the proceeds from asset sales. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default. Specifically, the indentures restrict ATI, each of the sister guarantors and its and their restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock. ATI, the sister guarantors and its and their subsidiaries are permitted, however, to incur debt under our credit facilities, or renewals, refundings, replacements or refinancings of them, up to $1.6 billion. The indentures governing the terms of our 9 3/8% senior notes and our 7.50% senior notes (issued in February 2004) also contain certain restrictive covenants with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply. These include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions, make certain investments and, as in the credit facilities, use the proceeds from asset sales. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default. Specifically, the senior note indentures restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock unless our consolidated debt is not greater than 7.5 times our adjusted consolidated cash flow. We are permitted, however, to incur debt under our credit facilities (which for these purposes includes indebtedness under the credit facilities of our borrower subsidiaries, the ATI 12.25% Notes, the ATI 7.25% Notes and a portion of our 3.25% convertible notes) even if we are not in compliance with this ratio, or renewals, refundings, replacements or refinancings of our credit facilities. If a default occurred under our credit facilities or any of our other debt securities, the maturity dates for our outstanding debt could be accelerated, and we likely would be prohibited from making additional borrowings under the credit facilities until we cured the default. If this were to occur, we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial ratios defined in the various agreements and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. However, due to the risk factors outlined above in “Business—Factors That May Affect Future Results,” there can be no assurance that our financial performance will not deteriorate to a point that would result in a default. As outlined above, as of December 31, 2003, our annual consolidated cash debt service obligations (principal and interest) for each of the next five years and thereafter are approximately: $276.0 million, $303.0 million, $540.0 million (which does not reflect the repurchase of our 6.25% convertible notes in February 2004), 37 Table of Contents $867.0 million, $941.0 million and $1.9 billion, respectively. If we are unable to refinance our subsidiary debt or renegotiate the terms of such debt, we may not be able to meet our debt service requirements in the future. In addition, as a holding company, we depend on distributions or dividends from our subsidiaries, or funds raised through debt and equity offerings, to fund our debt obligations. Although the agreements governing the terms of our credit facilities and senior subordinated notes permit our subsidiaries to make distributions to us to permit us to meet our debt service obligations, such terms also significantly limit their ability to distribute cash to us under certain circumstances. Accordingly, if we do not receive sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our debt, and there is no assurance we will succeed in such efforts. Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our debt obligations, and our ability to refinance such debt obligations, will depend on our future financial performance, which is subject to many factors beyond our control, as outlined above under “Business – Factors That May Affect Future Results.” In addition, our ability to refinance any of our debt in the future may depend on our credit ratings from commercial rating agencies, which are dependent on our expected financial performance, the liquidity factors discussed above, and the rating agencies’ outlook for our industry. We expect that we will need to refinance a substantial portion or our debt on or prior to its scheduled maturity in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure such refinancings or, if such refinancings are obtained, that the terms will be commercially reasonable. Capital Markets. Our ability to raise additional funds in the capital markets depends on, among other things, general economic conditions, conditions of the wireless industry, our financial performance and the state of the capital markets. In December 2003, we filed a “universal” shelf registration statement for possible future offerings of an aggregate of up to $1.0 billion of debt and/or equity securities, including the offering of Class A common stock pursuant to a direct stock purchase plan with respect to which our Board of Directors currently has approved a $150.0 million offering. This registration statement is not yet effective. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to income taxes, impairment of assets, allowances for accounts receivable, investment impairment charges and revenue recognition. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. For a discussion of our other accounting policies, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K, beginning on page F-7. • Income Taxes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. At December 31, 2003, we provided a valuation allowance of approximately $156.7 million primarily related to our net state deferred tax assets and capital loss carryforwards. In addition, we also recorded a valuation allowance in 2002 38 Table of Contents related to a tax planning strategy related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses. The valuation allowance represents the estimated lost tax benefit and costs associated with such strategy. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our tax refund claims and our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as management believes that we will be successful with our tax refund claims and have sufficient time to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty-year tax carryforward period. We intend to recover a portion of our net deferred tax asset through our tax refund claims related to certain federal net operating losses, filed during 2003 as part of a tax planning strategy implemented in 2002. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state (no growth) projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments reducing interest expense. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $1.0 billion in taxable income from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2023. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described above, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense, which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity. Depending on the resolution of the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we may be entitled to a worthless stock or bad debt deduction for our investment in Verestar. No income tax benefit has been provided for these potential deductions due to the uncertainty surrounding the bankruptcy proceedings. • Impairment of Assets. Assets subject to amortization and non-core assets held for sale: We review long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows. If we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset’s fair market value as compared to its carrying value. We record any related impairment losses in the period in which we identify such impairment. We also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based on management’s best estimate of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition. We record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss. Goodwill—Assets not subject to amortization: As of January 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized, but reviewed for impairment at least annually. SFAS No. 142 also requires that we assess whether goodwill is impaired by performing a transitional impairment test. These tests compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. We completed our transitional impairment testing in the second quarter of 2002 and concluded that all of the goodwill related to Verestar was impaired and that the majority of the goodwill in the services segment was impaired. As a result, we recognized a $562.6 million non-cash charge (net of a tax benefit of $14.4 million) related to the write-down of goodwill to its fair value. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, the charge is reflected as of January 1, 2002 and included in the results of operations 39 Table of Contents for the year ended December 31, 2002 as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Fair value estimates were determined based on independent third party appraisals for the rental and management segment and Verestar and future discounted cash flows and market information in the services segment. In December 2003 and 2002, we completed our annual impairment testing related to the goodwill of the rental and management reporting unit (incorporating an independent third party appraisal) that contains goodwill and, in both cases, determined that goodwill was not impaired. Fair value estimates are based on our historical and projected operating results and market information, changes to which could affect those fair value estimates. Our December 2002 annual impairment testing also included the remaining goodwill of Kline (the only services business with remaining goodwill) and, based on available market information, we determined that goodwill was not impaired. In June 2003, we committed to a plan to sell Kline, reclassified its net assets to assets held for sale and recorded an impairment charge (inclusive of Kline’s remaining $10.3 million of goodwill) that reduced Kline’s net assets to the estimated fair value expected upon disposal. We will perform our annual goodwill impairment test on December 1st of each year and when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. • Allowances for Accounts Receivable. We maintain allowances for accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make contractually obligated payments that totals approximately $17.4 million as of December 31, 2003. When evaluating the adequacy of the allowances for accounts receivable, we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, current economic trends, changes in our customers’ payment terms and the age of the receivables. If the basis for our estimates and financial condition of our customers were to change, adjustments to the allowances may be required. • Investment Impairment Charges. Investments in those entities where we own less than twenty percent of the voting stock of the individual entity and do not exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the entity are accounted for using the cost method. Investments in entities where we own less than twenty percent but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the entity or where we own more than twenty percent of the voting stock of the individual entity, but not in excess of fifty percent, are accounted for using the equity method. Our investments are in companies that are not publicly traded, and, therefore, no established market for these securities exists. We have a policy in place to review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the investments in these companies. If we believe that the carrying value of an investment is carried at an amount in excess of fair value, it is our policy to record an impairment charge to adjust the carrying value to the market value. • Revenue Recognition. A portion of our network development services revenue is derived under contracts or arrangements with customers that provide for billings on a fixed price basis. Revenues under these contracts are recognized using the percentage-of-completion methodology. Under the percentage-of-completion methodology, revenues are recognized in accordance with the percentage of contract costs incurred to date compared to the estimated total contract costs. Due to uncertainties and estimates inherent within percentage-of-completion accounting it is possible that estimates will be revised as project work progresses. Changes to total estimated contract costs or losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined. 40 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003 and December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (FIN 46), and its revision, FIN 46-R, respectively. FIN 46 and FIN 46-R addresses the consolidation of entities whose equity holders have either not provided sufficient equity at risk to allow the entity to finance its own activities or do not possess certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest. FIN 46 and FIN 46-R require the consolidation of these entities, known as variable interest entities (VIEs), by the primary beneficiary of the entity. The primary beneficiary is the entity, if any, that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the VIE’s activities, entitled to receive a majority of the VIE’s residual returns, or both. FIN 46 and FIN 46-R are applicable for financial statements of public entities that have interests in VIEs or potential VIEs referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003, of which we had none. Application by public entities for all other types of entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. We have applied the provisions of FIN 46 and the adoption was not material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We continue to evaluate our investments to determine which, if any, will be impacted by the adoption of FIN 46-R. The adoption of FIN 46-R is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Information Presented Pursuant to the Indenture of Our 9 3/8% Notes The following table sets forth information that is presented solely to address certain reporting requirements contained in the indenture for our 9 3/8% Notes. This information presents certain of our financial data on a consolidated basis and on a restricted group basis, as defined in the indenture governing the senior notes. All of our subsidiaries are part of the restricted group, except our wholly owned subsidiary Verestar. In December 2002, we committed to a plan to dispose of Verestar by sale by December 31, 2003. In December 2003, Verestar filed for protection under the federal bankruptcy laws and ceased to be included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the filing date forward. Accordingly, the results of operations related to Verestar have been included in loss from discontinued operations in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations through the date of the bankruptcy filing in December 2003.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long-term debt obligations. We attempt to reduce these risks by utilizing derivative financial instruments, namely interest rate caps, swaps, and collars pursuant to our policies. All derivative financial instruments are for purposes other than trading. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we prepaid $757.8 million of outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities and made scheduled principal payments under the term loans of $47.5 million. In addition, we issued $420.0 million of ATI 12.25% Notes with a principal at maturity of $808.0 million, $210.0 million of 3.25% Notes and $400.0 million of ATI 7.25% Notes. We also had two swaps and two collars expire with aggregate notional amounts totaling $400.0 million and $232.5 million, respectively. The following tables provide information as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates. For long-term debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows by maturity date and average interest rates related to outstanding obligations. For interest rate caps, swaps and collars, the tables present notional principal amounts and weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.

Interest on the credit facilities is payable in accordance with the applicable London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2003 for the credit facilities was 4.25%. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the weighted average interest rate under the credit facilities was 3.85%. The 2.25% and 6.25% Notes each bear interest (after giving effect to the accretion of the original discount on the 2.25% Notes) at 6.25% per annum, which is payable semiannually on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The 5.0% Notes bear interest at 5.0% per annum, which is payable semiannually on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The ATI 12.25% Notes bear interest (after giving effect to the accretion of the original discount and the accretion of the warrants) at 14.7% per annum, payable upon maturity. The 9 3/8% Notes bear interest at 9 3/8% per annum, which is payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The 3.25% Notes bear interest at 3.25% per annum, which is payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The ATI 7.25% Notes bear interest at 7.25% per annum, which is payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. Other debt consists of notes payable, capital leases and other obligations bearing interest at rates ranging from 7.9% to 12.0%, payable monthly. In January 2004, we refinanced our $267.0 million term loan B under our credit facilities, with a new term loan C due December 31, 2007. The new term loan C has substantially the same terms as term loan B, except that the interest rate spreads for the LIBOR and base rate loans were reduced from 3.5% above LIBOR to 2.25% and from 2.5% above the base rate to 1.25%, respectively. In February 2004, we sold $225.0 million principal amount of 7.50% senior notes due 2012 through an institutional private placement. The net proceeds of the offering were approximately $221.7 million and were used to redeem all of our outstanding 6.25% Notes and to repurchase $4.5 million of our outstanding 5.0% Notes. As of December 31, 2002 variable rate debt consists of our credit facilities ($1.51 billion) and fixed rate debt consists of the 2.25% Notes ($210.9 million), the 6.25% Notes ($212.7 million), the 5.0% Notes ($450.0 million), the 9 3/8% Notes ($1.0 billion) and other debt of $64.9 million. Interest on the credit facilities is payable in accordance with the applicable London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2002 for the credit facilities was 4.48%. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the weighted average interest rate under the credit facilities was 4.41%. The 2.25% and 6.25% Notes each bear interest (after giving effect to the accretion of the original discount on the 2.25% Notes) at 6.25% per annum, which is payable semiannually on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The 5.0% Notes bear interest at 5.0% per annum, which is payable semiannually on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The 9 3/8% Notes bear interest at 9 3/8% per annum, which is payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year beginning August 1, 2001. Other debt consists of notes payable, capital leases and other obligations bearing interest at rates ranging from 7.1% to 12.0%, payable monthly. (b) Represents the weighted-average fixed rate or range of interest based on contract notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts in a given year. (c) Includes notional amounts of $125,000, $250,000 and $125,000 that will expire in May, June and July 2004, respectively.

(e) Includes notional amounts of $185,000 and $47,500 that expired in May and June 2003, respectively. We maintain a portion of our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and investments in short-term financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risks. Due to the relatively short duration of such instruments, we believe fluctuations in interest rates with respect to those investments will not materially affect our financial condition or results of operations. 44 Table of Contents Our foreign operations include rental and management segment divisions in Mexico and Brazil. The remeasurement loss (gain) for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 approximated $1,142,000 $3,713,000 and $(207,000), respectively.",2023-12-30 19:23:32.935828
1053507,AMT,AMERICAN TOWER CORP /MA/,2005,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures in our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the heading “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” on page 40. Our continuing operations are reported in two segments, rental and management and network development services. Management focuses on segment profit (loss) as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments. We define segment operating profit (loss) as segment revenues less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense, corporate general, administrative and development expense, and impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets and restructuring expense. Segment profit (loss) for the rental and management segment includes interest income, TV Azteca, net (see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements). In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the consolidated statements of operations for periods presented in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” have been adjusted to reflect certain businesses as discontinued operations (see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements). Executive Overview Our principal operating segment is our rental and management segment, which accounted for approximately 96.9% and 98.0% of our total revenues and approximately 99.3% and 99.2% of our segment operating profit for the years ending December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The primary factors affecting the stability and growth of our revenues and cash flows for this segment are our recurring revenues from existing tenant leases and the contractual escalators in those leases, leasing additional space on our existing towers, acquiring and building additional tower sites and the degree to which any of our existing customer leases are cancelled. We continue to believe that our leasing revenue is likely to grow more rapidly than revenue from our network development services segment due to our strategic focus on our rental and management segment, the continuing growth in the use of wireless communications services and our ability to utilize existing tower capacity. In addition, we believe the majority of our leasing activity will continue to come from wireless broadband-services customers. The majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are for an initial term of five-to-ten years, with multiple five year renewal terms thereafter. Accordingly, a significant majority of the revenue generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of December 2004 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. In addition, most of our leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease. These contractual escalators are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage (generally three-to-five percent), inflation, or a fixed percentage plus inflation. Rate increases based on fixed escalation clauses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial non-cancelable term of the applicable agreement. A significant majority of our revenue growth in 2004 was attributable to incremental revenue generated from leasing additional space on our existing towers. During 2004, incremental revenue attributable to towers that existed during the entire period between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2004, was approximately $51 million. Our ability to lease additional space on our towers is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and, to a lesser extent, the location of and available capacity on our existing towers. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure, the financial performance of our customers and their access to capital, and general economic conditions. We believe leasing additional space on our existing towers will continue to contribute the substantial majority of our year-over-year revenue growth in 2005. 22 Table of Contents We also generate revenues by building and acquiring new towers. In 2004 and 2003, we constructed or acquired 275 and 618 towers, respectively. Because of the nature of our recurring revenues described above, our results of operations only reflect revenues generated on these towers following the respective dates of their construction or acquisition, which affects year-over-year comparisons. The revenues generated by our rental and management segment also may be affected by cancellations of existing customer leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multi-year contracts, which typically may not be cancelled or, in some instances, may be cancelled in exchange for payment of a termination fee. Accordingly, lease cancellations historically have not had a material adverse impact on the revenues generated by our rental and management segment. Our rental and management segment operating expenses are comprised of two major categories: direct tower level expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. Our direct tower level expenses consist primarily of ground rent, maintenance, taxes and utilities. Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of expenses to support our rental and management and network development services such as sales and property management functions and are included in our rental and management and network development services segment operating expenses. These expenses exclude corporate selling, general and administrative expenses, which are included in corporate general, administrative and development expense. As a result of organizational initiatives in 2002 and 2003 to manage our operations more efficiently, our segment operating expenses have decreased over these periods and were stable in 2004. Because our operating expenses generally do not increase significantly when we add additional customers on a tower site, leasing space to new customers on our existing sites provides significant incremental cash flow. Our profit margin growth is, therefore, directly related to the number of new tenants added to our existing tower sites and the related rental revenue generated in a particular period. Our tower network consists of approximately 15,000 sites in the United States, Mexico and Brazil. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 12,500 tower sites were located in the United States, 1,900 tower sites were located in Mexico and approximately 450 tower sites were located in Brazil. For the year ended December 31, 2004, approximately 16.6% of our consolidated revenues were generated by our international operations. We anticipate that the revenues from our international operations as a percentage of our consolidated revenues may grow in the future. 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2004 2003 (In thousands) REVENUES: Rental and management $ 684,422 $ 619,697 $ 64,725 10 % Network development services 22,238 12,796 9,442 74 Total revenues 706,660 632,493 74,167 12 OPERATING EXPENSES: Rental and management 237,312 236,680 632 1 Network development services 18,801 9,493 9,308 98 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 329,449 330,414 (965 ) (1 ) Corporate general, administrative and development expense 27,468 26,867 601 2 Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets and restructuring expense 23,876 31,656 (7,780 ) (25 ) Total operating expenses 636,906 635,110 1,796 1 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest income, TV Azteca, net of interest expense $1,497 and $1,496 14,316 14,222 94 1 Interest income 4,844 5,255 (411 ) (8 ) Interest expense (262,237 ) (279,783 ) (17,546 ) (6 ) Loss on retirement of long-term obligations (138,016 ) (46,197 ) 91,819 199 Other expense (2,798 ) (8,598 ) (5,800 ) (67 ) Income tax benefit 80,176 77,796 2,380 3 Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries (2,366 ) (3,703 ) (1,337 ) (36 ) Loss on equity method investments (2,915 ) (21,221 ) (18,306 ) (86 ) Loss from discontinued operations, net (8,345 ) (60,475 ) (52,130 ) (86 ) Net loss $ (247,587 ) $ (325,321 ) $ (77,734 ) (24 )% Total Revenues Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $706.7 million, an increase of $74.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase resulted from an increase in rental and management revenues of $64.7 million and an increase in network development services revenue of $9.4 million. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $684.4 million, an increase of $64.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase resulted primarily from adding additional wireless and broadband tenants to towers that existed as of January 1, 2003 and, to a lesser extent, from revenue generated on the approximately 900 towers acquired and/or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2003. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in revenue on the approximately 400 owned towers sold or disposed of subsequent to January 1, 2003. In 2004, our revenue growth on towers that existed during the entire period beginning January 1, 2003 and ending December 31, 2004, was approximately $51 million. We believe that our rental and management revenue will continue to grow as we utilize existing tower capacity. We anticipate that the majority of our new leasing activity will continue to come from wireless and broadcast service providers. 24 Table of Contents Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $22.2 million, an increase of $9.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in revenues during 2004 resulted primarily from a long-term construction contract that we did not have in the prior year. In October 2004, we entered into an agreement to sell our tower construction services unit. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2004, we reported our tower construction services unit as a discontinued operation. The sale closed in November 2004. After the sale, our network development services segment is focused on providing complementary non-construction services to the rental and management segment, including site acquisition, zoning, permitting and structural analysis. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $636.9 million, an increase of $1.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The principal components of the increase were attributable to expense increases in our network development services segment of $9.3 million, our rental and management segment of $0.6 million and corporate general, administrative and development expense of $0.6 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets and restructuring expense of $7.8 million and in depreciation, amortization and accretion of $1.0 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $237.3 million, an increase of $0.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase resulted primarily from our acquisition/construction of approximately 900 towers partially offset by a reduction in expenses related to the 400 towers that were sold or disposed of subsequent to January 2003, coupled with an overall decrease in rental and management segment expenses. Rental and management segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $461.4 million, an increase of $64.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase resulted primarily from incremental revenues and operating profit from adding additional broadband tenants to existing towers and newly acquired and/or constructed towers. Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $18.8 million, an increase of $9.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in expenses during 2004 resulted primarily from expenses associated with a long-term construction contract that we did not have in the prior year. Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long-Lived Assets and Restructuring Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets and restructuring expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $23.9 million, a decrease of $7.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The majority of the decrease resulted from decreased impairments and losses on sales of long-lived tower and other non-core assets. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $262.2 million, a decrease of $17.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease resulted primarily from the retirement of a portion of our 9 3/8% senior notes and 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes partially offset by additional interest incurred related to the issuance of our 3.00% convertible notes, 7.125% senior notes and 7.5% senior notes in 2004. 25 Table of Contents Loss on Retirement of Long-Term Obligations During the year ended December 31, 2004, we retired all or a portion of our 6.25% convertible notes, 9 3/8% senior notes and ATI 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes. As a result, we incurred a charge of approximately $103.2 million, which represented the cash paid in excess of the carrying value of the debt at the time of retirement. In addition, we also incurred a charge of $34.8 million related to the write-off of deferred financing fees related to the retirements discussed above, the retirement of a portion of our 5.0% convertible notes and the refinancing of our credit facility. The total of these charges, $138.0 million, represents our loss on retirement of long-term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we amended our credit facility and made certain prepayments and unscheduled principal payments on the term loans thereunder, which collectively reduced the borrowing capacity under our credit facility. As a result, we recorded an aggregate charge of approximately $11.9 million related to the write-off of deferred financing fees associated with the reduction in our overall borrowing capacity. We also repurchased a portion of our 2.25% convertible notes and 5.0% convertible notes (inclusive of the cash tender offer for our 2.25% convertible notes that expired on October 22, 2003) throughout the year. As a result, we incurred an aggregate charge of approximately $34.3 million, which primarily represented the fair market value of the shares of stock issued to our 2.25% convertible note holders in excess of the shares originally issuable upon conversion of the notes, offset by a net gain on the repurchases of our 5.0% convertible notes. The total of these charges, $46.2 million, represents our loss on retirement of long-term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2003. Other Expense Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $2.8 million, a decrease of $5.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease resulted primarily from fees and expenses incurred in 2003 in connection with a financing transaction that we did not consummate as a result of the ATI 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes offering. Income Tax Benefit The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $80.2 million, an increase of $2.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The effective tax rate was 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to 24.5% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The primary reason for the increase in the effective tax rate is a result of non-deductible losses on retirements of our debt in 2003. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to capital losses and foreign items. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to our capital losses, foreign items and non-deductible losses on retirement of our debt. SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” requires that we record a valuation allowance when it is “more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.” At December 31, 2004, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $173.1 million primarily related to net state deferred tax assets, capital loss carryforwards, certain foreign items and the lost tax benefit and costs associated with our tax refund claims. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our tax refund claims as discussed below and our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as management believes that we will be successful with our tax refund claims and will have sufficient time to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty-year tax carryforward period. In June 2003, we filed an income tax refund claim with the IRS relating to carrying back net operating losses that we generated in 1998, 1999 and 2001. We filed a similar claim in October 2003, with respect to net 26 Table of Contents operating losses generated in 2002. In total, we carried back approximately $380.0 million of federal net operating losses generated prior to 2003. We anticipate receiving a refund of approximately $90.0 million as a result of these claims, which will monetize a portion of our deferred tax asset. We estimate recovery of these amounts within two to three years of the dates the claims were filed with the IRS. There can be no assurances, however, with respect to the specific amount and timing of the refund. We intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset through our tax refund claims discussed above. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state (no growth) projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments reducing interest expense. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2004 will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $1.4 billion in taxable income from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2024. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future, or carry back losses, as described above, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense, which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders’ equity. Loss on Equity Method Investments Loss on equity method investments for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $2.9 million, a decrease of $18.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease is primarily due to an impairment charge recorded on one of our equity investments of $19.3 million in 2003. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net Loss from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $8.3 million, as compared to $60.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. In October 2004, we committed to a plan to sell our tower construction services unit, which was subsequently sold in November 2004. In addition, we sold Kline in March 2004. Accordingly, the loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes $7.7 million related to the results of these operations through the date of sale. In addition, the loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes a net loss on disposal of our tower construction services unit of $1.7 million and a $1.1 million net gain related to a contractual obligation that was settled for less than its original estimate. During 2003, we disposed of two of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Galaxy and Flash, two office buildings and Verestar’s MTN subsidiary. Accordingly, the loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes $12.0 million related to the results of these operations, our tower construction services unit, Kline and the remaining operations of Verestar through the date of its bankruptcy filing in December 2003. In addition to the above, loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes the following net losses on disposal: (a) an impairment charge of $26.5 million to reduce the carrying amount of our investment in Verestar to zero and to record our estimate of costs that we may incur under certain contractual obligations; (b) an impairment charge of $14.6 million to reduce the carrying value of Kline’s net assets to the estimated proceeds expected upon disposal; (c) a $2.4 million net loss on the disposal of Galaxy; (d) a $3.7 million net loss on the disposal of the office buildings; and (e) a $0.1 million net gain on the sale of Flash. 27 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2003 2002 (In thousands) REVENUES: Rental and management $ 619,697 $ 544,906 $ 74,791 14 % Network development services 12,796 32,888 (20,092 ) (61 ) Total revenues 632,493 577,794 54,699 9 OPERATING EXPENSES: Rental and management 236,680 242,801 (6,121 ) (3 ) Network development services 9,493 29,214 (19,721 ) (68 ) Depreciation, amortization and accretion 330,414 327,665 2,749 1 Corporate general, administrative and development expense 26,867 30,229 (3,362 ) (11 ) Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets and restructuring expense 31,656 101,372 (69,716 ) (69 ) Total operating expenses 635,110 731,281 (96,171 ) (13 ) OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest income, TV Azteca, net of interest expense $1,496 and $1,494 14,222 13,938 284 2 Interest income 5,255 3,496 1,759 50 Interest expense (279,783 ) (254,345 ) 25,438 10 Loss on retirement of long-term obligations (46,197 ) (8,869 ) 37,328 421 Other expense (8,598 ) (7,004 ) 1,594 23 Income tax benefit 77,796 81,141 (3,345 ) (4 ) Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries (3,703 ) (2,118 ) 1,585 75 Loss on equity method investments (21,221 ) (18,555 ) 2,666 14 Loss from discontinued operations, net (60,475 ) (255,119 ) (194,644 ) (76 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net (562,618 ) (562,618 ) (100 ) Net loss $ (325,321 ) $ (1,163,540 ) $ (838,219 ) (72 )% 28 Table of Contents Total Revenues Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $632.5 million, an increase of $54.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase resulted from an increase in rental and management revenues of $74.8 million, offset by a decrease in network development services revenue of $20.1 million. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $619.7 million, an increase of $74.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase resulted primarily from adding additional broadband tenants to towers that existed as of January 1, 2002 and, to a lesser extent, from revenue generated on the approximately 1,200 towers acquired and/or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2002. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $12.8 million, a decrease of $20.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The decline in revenues during 2003 resulted primarily from decreases in revenue related to the reduced demand for non-construction services in the wireless telecommunications industry. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $635.1 million, a decrease of $96.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The principal component of the decrease was attributable to a decrease in impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets and restructuring expense of $69.7 million. The remaining components of the decrease were attributable to decreases in expenses within our network development services segment of $19.7 million, our rental and management segment of $6.1 million and a decrease in corporate general, administrative and development expense of $3.4 million. Such decreases were offset by an increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion of approximately $2.7 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $236.7 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in certain rental and management segment overhead costs, partially offset by an increase in tower expenses related to the 1,200 towers we have acquired/constructed since January 1, 2002 due to their inclusion in our results for a full year in 2003. Rental and management segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $397.2 million, an increase of $81.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase resulted primarily from incremental revenues and operating profit from adding additional broadband tenants to existing towers and newly acquired and/or constructed towers, coupled with a net reduction in tower expenses, as discussed above. Network Development Services Expense/Segment Profit Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $9.5 million, a decrease of $19.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The majority of the decrease was due to an overall decline in demand for the services performed by this segment, as discussed above, partially offset by decreases in overhead and related infrastructure costs. Network development services segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $3.3 million, a decrease of $0.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease resulted primarily from a decline in revenue, as discussed above. 29 Table of Contents Corporate General, Administrative and Development Expense Corporate general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $26.9 million, a decrease of $3.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in development expense as a result of our curtailed acquisition and development related activities. Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long-Lived Assets and Restructuring Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets and restructuring expense was $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we sold approximately 300 non-core towers and certain other non-core assets and recorded impairment charges to write-down certain other non-core towers and assets. As a result, we recorded impairment charges and net loss on sale of long-lived assets of approximately $19.1 million. We also wrote-off approximately $9.2 million of construction-in-progress costs, primarily associated with sites we no longer planned to build. Lastly, we incurred employee separation costs (primarily associated with the reorganization of certain functions in our rental and management segment) and facility closing costs aggregating $3.4 million. Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets and restructuring expense was $101.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. During the year-ended December 31, 2002, we sold approximately 720 non-core towers and recorded impairment charges to write-down certain other non-core towers, which resulted in aggregate impairment charges and net losses of approximately $46.8 million. In September 2002, we reduced the scope of our new tower construction and build plans for the remainder of 2002 and 2003 and, as a result, we wrote-off approximately $40.2 million of construction-in-progress costs for the year ended December 31, 2002 associated with sites we no longer planned to build. Additionally, in the latter stages of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002, we announced a restructuring of our organization to include the centralization of certain operational and administrative functions. As a result of these initiatives, during the year ended December 31, 2002, we incurred employee separation costs associated with the termination of approximately 460 employees (primarily development and administrative), as well as costs associated with the termination of lease obligations and other incremental facility closing costs, aggregating $10.6 million. Interest Income Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $5.3 million, an increase of $1.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in interest earned on restricted cash and investments, resulting principally from our 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes offering in January 2003 and, to a lesser extent, our August 2003 equity offering. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $279.8 million, an increase of $25.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase resulted primarily from the following: interest expense on the ATI 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes, issued in January 2003; our 3.25% convertible notes, issued in August 2003; and the ATI 7.25% senior subordinated notes, issued in November 2003. The increase was partially offset by a net decrease in interest expense on our credit facilities as a result of repayments made during 2003 and, to a lesser extent, lower interest rates. The increase was also partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on our 2.25% and 5.0% convertible notes as a result of repurchases made during 2003 (as discussed below). Loss on Retirement of Long-Term Obligations During the year ended December 31, 2003, we amended our credit facility and made certain prepayments and unscheduled principal payments on the term loans thereunder, which collectively reduced the borrowing capacity under our credit facility. As a result, we recorded an aggregate charge of approximately $11.9 million related to the write-off of deferred financing fees associated with the reduction in our overall borrowing capacity. 30 Table of Contents We also repurchased a portion of our 2.25% convertible and 5.0% convertible notes (inclusive of the cash tender offer for our 2.25% convertible notes that expired in October 2003) throughout the year. As a result, we incurred an aggregate charge of approximately $34.3 million, which primarily represented the fair market value of the shares of stock issued to our 2.25% convertible note holders in excess of the shares originally issuable upon conversion of the notes, offset by a net gain on the repurchases of our 5.0% convertible notes. The total of these charges, $46.2 million, represents our loss on retirement of long-term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2003. In February 2002, we repaid $95.0 million outstanding under our Mexican credit facility with borrowings under our credit facility. As a result of such repayment, for the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded a charge of approximately $1.7 million related to the write-off of related deferred financing fees. In addition, in January 2002, we terminated the $250.0 million multi-draw term loan C component of our credit facility and recorded a non-cash charge of approximately $7.2 million related to the write-off of related deferred financing fees. The total of these charges, $8.9 million, represents our loss on retirement of long-term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2002. Other Expense Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $8.6 million, an increase of $1.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase resulted primarily from fees and expenses incurred in 2003 in connection with a financing transaction that we did not consummate as a result of the ATI 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes offering. This increase was primarily offset by decreased foreign currency transaction losses. Income Tax Benefit The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $77.8 million, a decrease of $3.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The effective tax rate was 24.5% for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to 20.0% for the year ended December 31, 2002. The primary reason for the increase in the effective tax rate is a result of a $27.5 million valuation allowance that we recorded in 2002 in connection with our tax planning strategy to carry back approximately $380.0 million of federal net operating losses generated prior to 2003. This strategy resulted in the filing of tax refund claims with the IRS in 2003. In June 2003, we filed an income tax refund claim with the IRS relating to carrying back net operating losses that we generated in 1998, 1999 and 2001. We filed a similar claim in October 2003, with respect to net operating losses generated in 2002. We anticipate receiving a refund of approximately $90.0 million as a result of these claims, which will monetize a portion of our deferred tax asset. We estimate recovery of these amounts within two to three years of the dates the claims were filed with the IRS. There can be no assurances, however, with respect to the specific amount and timing of the refund. The valuation allowance represents the estimated lost tax benefit and costs incurred in connection with implementing this strategy. This increase was offset in part by an increase in the valuation allowance in 2003 for capital losses and non-deductible losses on retirements of our debt. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to our capital losses, foreign items and non-deductible losses on retirement of our debt. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to our capital losses, foreign items and the valuation allowance recorded in connection with our tax planning strategy discussed above. SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” requires that we record a valuation allowance when it is “more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.” At December 31, 2003, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $162.8 million primarily related to net state deferred tax assets, capital loss carryforwards and the lost tax benefit and costs associated with the tax refund claims. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our tax refund claims and our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as management believes that we will be 31 Table of Contents successful with our tax refund claims and will have sufficient time to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty-year tax carryforward period. We intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset through our tax refund claims discussed above. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state (no growth) projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments reducing interest expense. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2003 will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $1.1 billion in taxable income from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2023. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future, or carry back losses, as described below, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense, which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders’ equity. Loss on Equity Method Investments Loss on equity method investments for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $21.2 million, an increase of $2.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase is related to an increase in impairment charges on our equity investments of $9.8 million, offset by a decrease in losses on our equity investments of $7.1 million. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net Loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $60.5 million, as compared to $255.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. During 2003, we consummated the sale of two of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Galaxy and Flash, two office buildings and Verestar’s MTN subsidiary. Accordingly, the loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes $12.0 million related to the results of these operations, our tower construction services unit, Kline and the remaining operations of Verestar through the date of its bankruptcy filing in December 2003. In addition to the above, loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes the following net losses on disposal: (a) an impairment charge of $26.5 million to reduce the carrying amount of our investment in Verestar to zero and to record our estimate of costs that we may incur under certain contractual obligations; (b) an impairment charge of $14.6 million to reduce the carrying value of Kline’s net assets to the estimated proceeds expected upon disposal; (c) a $2.4 million net loss on the disposal of Galaxy; (d) a $3.7 million net loss on the disposal of the office buildings; and (e) a $0.1 million net gain on the sale of Flash. During 2002, we consummated the sale of our wholly owned subsidiary MTS Components and an office building. Accordingly, the loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2002 includes $241.6 million related to the results of these operations through the date of sale. In addition, 2002 also includes the results of operations of Galaxy, Flash, two other office buildings, our tower construction services unit, Kline and Verestar. In addition to the above, the loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2002 includes a net loss on our disposition of MTS Components of approximately $16.0 million, a net gain on our sale of the office building of $5.7 million and an impairment charge of $3.2 million related to another office building sold in 2003. Cumulative Effective of Change in Accounting Principle, Net As of January 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” As a result, we recognized a $562.6 million non-cash charge (net of a tax benefit of $14.4 million) as the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the write-down of goodwill to its fair value. The non-cash charge was comprised of goodwill within our former satellite and fiber network access services 32 Table of Contents segment ($189.3 million) and network development services segment ($387.8 million). In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, the charge is reflected as of January 1, 2002 and included in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview During the year ended December 31, 2004, we took several actions to increase our financial flexibility, extend the maturity dates of our indebtedness and reduce interest expense. In May 2004, we entered into a new $1.1 billion senior secured credit facility. In 2004, we also completed four note offerings through institutional private placements in an aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion. We used the net proceeds of the borrowings under the credit facility and the note offerings, as well as cash on hand, to refinance or repurchase approximately $2.0 billion of our outstanding debt. For information about our financing activities, see “—Financing Activities” below. As of December 31, 2004, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $3.3 billion. We incurred substantially all of this indebtedness to refinance indebtedness incurred prior to 2002 to fund the acquisition of communications sites and services businesses (expenditures for such acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 were $1.4 billion and $812.8 million, respectively), and capital expenditures related to the construction of new communications sites (capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 were $541.3 million and $568.2 million, respectively). Beginning in 2002, we significantly reduced our acquisitions and new tower construction activities, and began to focus on reducing our overall indebtedness. In 2003 and 2004, we continued this effort by reducing our net total indebtedness and improving our financial flexibility by refinancing indebtedness to extend maturity dates. We plan to continue to reduce our overall indebtedness in 2005 with cash flow from operations, and may opportunistically further reduce indebtedness and interest expense through future capital market or strategic transactions. In 2004, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and cash interest obligations. We believe our cash generated from operations for the year ending December 31, 2005 also will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and our cash debt service (interest and principal repayments) obligations for 2005. For information about our outstanding indebtedness, see “—Contractual Obligations” below. We expect our 2005 cash needs to consist primarily of the following: debt service, including cash interest of approximately $173.0 million, the redemption of approximately $133.0 million of 9 3/8% senior notes, the repayment of approximately $4.0 million of term loans under the credit facility and capital lease payments and other notes payable of approximately $4.5 million; and capital expenditures of between $55.0 and $65.0 million, principally related to new tower construction and improvements to existing towers. We expect to meet these cash needs through a combination of cash on hand and cash generated by operations. Due to the risk factors outlined in “Business—Factors That May Affect Future Results,” however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our cash needs without additional borrowings under our credit facility. Uses of Cash Tower Acquisitions, Construction and Improvements. Historically, we have used available cash, including cash obtained from our credit facility, proceeds from the sale of our debt and equity securities and proceeds from non-core asset sales, to fund the acquisition, construction and improvement of tower assets. In 2002, we began to reduce our capital expenditures on new tower development. As a result, our capital expenditures in 2003 and 2004 were $61.6 million and $42.2 million, respectively, significantly below historical levels. • Construction and Improvements. Payments for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities during the year ended December 31, 2004 totaled $42.2 million, including capital expenditures 33 Table of Contents incurred in connection with the construction of 61 towers. We anticipate that we will build between 125 and 150 new towers through the end of 2005, and expect our 2005 total capital expenditures for construction, improvements and corporate purposes to be between approximately $55.0 million and $65.0 million. • Acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we acquired a total of 214 towers for approximately $33.4 million, including 25 towers in Brazil and 18 towers in Mexico from NII Holdings for an aggregate of $7.6 million, 97 towers in Mexico from Iusacell Celular for an aggregate of $20.8 million, and 74 towers in the United States from various sellers for an aggregate of $4.3 million. As of December 31, 2004, we were obligated to acquire up to an additional $2.5 million of tower assets. We plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that can provide the highest potential returns in light of existing market conditions. Accordingly, we may continue to acquire tower sites, build new tower sites and redevelop or improve existing tower sites when the expected returns on such investments meet our investment criteria. Refinancing and Repurchases of Debt. In order to extend the maturity dates of our indebtedness and reduce interest expense, we use our cash to refinance and repurchase our outstanding debt securities. During 2004, we refinanced or repurchased approximately $2.0 billion of our outstanding debt. For more information about our financing activities, see “—Financing Activities” below. Contractual Obligations. Our contractual obligations relate primarily to borrowings under the credit facility and our outstanding notes. The following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations payable in cash as of December 31, 2004 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Credit facility term loan A (1)(2) $ 22,500 $ 52,500 $ 60,000 $ 60,000 $ 105,000 $ 300,000 Credit facility term loan B (1)(2) $ 4,000 4,000 4,000 4,000 4,000 378,000 398,000 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes (3) 498,251 498,251 7.25% senior subordinated notes 400,000 400,000 9 3/8% senior notes (4) 133,000 141,884 274,884 7.50% senior notes 225,000 225,000 7.125% senior notes 500,000 500,000 5.0% convertible notes (5) 275,688 275,688 3.25% convertible notes 210,000 210,000 3.00% convertible notes 345,000 345,000 2.25% convertible notes 46 46 Long-term obligations, excluding capital leases and other notes payable 137,046 26,500 332,188 562,251 205,884 2,163,000 3,426,869 Cash interest expense (1)(2)(3) 173,000 171,000 158,000 153,000 125,000 275,000 1,055,000 Capital lease payments (including interest) and other notes payable 4,484 19,691 3,732 3,290 3,250 208,587 243,034 Operating lease payments (6) 106,116 106,319 106,095 106,191 106,214 1,570,111 2,101,046 Purchase obligations for acquisitions 2,500 2,500 Other long-term liabilities (7) 210 996 223 223 223 24,909 26,784 Total $ 423,356 $ 324,506 $ 600,238 $ 824,955 $ 440,571 $ 4,241,607 $ 6,855,233 A description of our contractual debt obligations is included in Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” as well as in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. (1) The maturity date for our term loan A and any outstanding revolving loans will be accelerated to August 15, 2008, and the maturity date for our term loan B will be accelerated to October 31, 2008, if (1) on or prior to August 1, 2008, our 9 3/8% senior notes have not been (a) refinanced with parent company indebtedness having a maturity date of February 28, 2012 or later or with loans under the credit facility, or (b) repaid, prepaid, redeemed, repurchased or otherwise retired; and (2) our consolidated leverage ratio (total parent company debt to annualized operating cash flow) at June 30, 2008 exceeds 4.50 to 1.00. If this were to occur, the payments due in 2008 for term loan A and term loan B would be $225.0 million and $386.0 million, respectively. 34 Table of Contents (2) Interest under our credit facility is payable in accordance with the applicable London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option, either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2004 for the credit facility was 4.35%. For projections of our cash interest expense related to the credit facility, we have assumed the LIBOR rate before the margin as defined in our credit facility agreement, is 2.6% through August 31, 2011. (3) The 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes were originally issued as part of an offering of 808,000 units, each unit consisting of one 12.25% senior subordinated discount note having a principal amount of $1,000 at maturity and one warrant to purchase 14.0953 shares of our Class A common stock at $0.01 per share. The 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes accrue no cash interest. Instead, the accreted value of each note increases between the date of original issuance and maturity (August 1, 2008) at a rate of 12.25% per annum. As of December 31, 2004, the remaining outstanding debt under the 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes was $325.4 million accreted value ($303.8 million, net of the allocated fair value of the warrants of $21.6 million). (4) On December 6, 2004, we issued a notice for the partial redemption on January 5, 2005 of $133.0 million principal amount of our 9 3/8% senior notes due 2009. Pursuant to the indenture for the 9 3/8% senior notes, once a notice to redeem is issued, notes called for redemption become irrevocably due and payable on the redemption date. Following this redemption, $141.9 million principal amount of 9 3/8% senior notes remained outstanding. (5) The holders of our 5.0% convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on specified dates prior to their maturity date in 2010, but we may pay the purchase price by issuing shares of our Class A common stock, subject to certain conditions. The obligation with respect to the right of the holders to put the 5.0% convertible notes on February 20, 2007, has been classified as a cash obligation for 2007. (6) Operating lease payments include payments to be made under non-cancelable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable tower site and related revenues from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that we will renew the lease. (7) Excludes certain other long-term liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily our deferred rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash. The above table does not include certain commitments relating to the construction of tower sites under existing build to suit agreements as of December 31, 2004, as we cannot currently estimate the timing and amounts of such payments. (See note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.) Sources of Cash Total Liquidity at December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $596.3 million of total liquidity, comprised of approximately $215.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to draw approximately $380.7 million of the revolving loan under our credit facility. Of the approximately $215.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, we used approximately $145.1 million to redeem on January 5, 2005 a portion of our outstanding 9 3/8% senior notes. Cash Generated by Operations. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, our cash provided by operating activities was $216.7 million, $156.4 million and $105.1 million, respectively. Each of our rental and management and network development services segments are expected to generate cash flows from operations during 2005 in excess of their cash needs for operations and capital expenditures for tower construction, improvements and acquisitions. We expect to use the excess cash generated by operations principally to service our debt. Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $380.7 million of unused capacity under our revolving loan commitments, the only loan under our credit facility that is not fully drawn. We have not borrowed any amounts under our credit facility since refinancing it in May 2004. Proceeds from the New Credit Facility and Sales of Debt Securities. In May 2004, we refinanced our previous credit facility with a new $1.1 billion senior secured credit facility. In 2004, we also completed four note offerings in institutional private placements through which we raised aggregate net proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion. See “Financing Activities.” Divestiture Proceeds. During 2004, we continued to execute our strategy of divesting non-core assets and reinvesting the proceeds of such divestitures in higher return tower assets. We received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $32.0 million related to the sale of Kline, our tower construction services unit, and non-core towers and related assets. Proceeds from these and any future transactions have and will be used, to the extent permitted under our credit facilities and mortgages, to acquire additional tower assets and to service debt. 35 Table of Contents Proceeds from the Sale of Equity Securities. From time to time, we raise funds through public offerings of our equity securities. In addition, we receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our stock option and stock purchase plans. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we received approximately $40.6 million in proceeds from sales of shares of our Class A common stock and the common stock of ATC Mexico pursuant to our stock option and stock purchase plans. Financing Activities During the year ended December 31, 2004, we took several actions to increase our financial flexibility and reduce our interest costs. New Credit Facility. In May 2004, we refinanced our previous credit facility with a new $1.1 billion senior secured credit facility. At closing, we received $685.5 million of net proceeds from the borrowings under the new facility, after deducting related expenses and fees, approximately $670.0 million of which we used to repay principal and interest under the previous credit facility. We used the remaining net proceeds of $15.5 million for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of other outstanding debt securities. The new credit facility consists of the following: • $400.0 million in undrawn revolving loan commitments, against which approximately $19.3 million of undrawn letters of credit were outstanding at December 31, 2004, maturing on February 28, 2011; • a $300.0 million term loan A, which is fully drawn, maturing on February 28, 2011; and • a $398.0 million term loan B, which is fully drawn, maturing on August 31, 2011. The new credit facility extends the previous credit facility maturity dates from 2007 to 2011 for a majority of the borrowings outstanding, subject to earlier maturity upon the occurrence of certain events described below, and allows us to use credit facility borrowings and internally generated funds to repurchase other indebtedness without additional lender approval. The new credit facility is guaranteed by us and is secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets. The maturity date for term loan A and any outstanding revolving loans will be accelerated to August 15, 2008, and the maturity date for term loan B will be accelerated to October 31, 2008, if (1) on or prior to August 1, 2008, our 9 3/8% senior notes have not been (a) refinanced with parent company indebtedness having a maturity date of February 28, 2012 or later or with loans under the new credit facility, or (b) repaid, prepaid, redeemed, repurchased or otherwise retired, and (2) our consolidated leverage ratio (total parent company debt to annualized operating cash flow) at June 30, 2008 is greater than 4.50 to 1.00. If this were to occur, the payments due in 2008 for term loan A and term loan B would be $225.0 million and $386.0 million, respectively. Note Offerings. During 2004, we raised approximately $1.1 billion in net proceeds from the sale of debt securities through institutional private placements as follows (in millions): Debt Security Date of Offering PrincipalAmount ApproximateNet Proceeds 7.50% Senior Notes due 2012 February 2004 $ 225.0 $ 221.7 3.00% Convertible Notes due August 15, 2012 August 2004 345.0 335.9 7.125% Senior Notes due 2012 October 2004 300.0 292.8 7.125% Senior Notes due 2012 December 2004 200.0 199.8 Total $ 1,070.0 $ 1,050.2 • 7.50% Senior Notes Offering. In February 2004, we sold $225.0 million principal amount of our 7.50% senior notes due 2012 through an institutional private placement. The 7.50% senior notes mature on May 1, 2012, and interest is payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year. 36 Table of Contents We may redeem the 7.50% senior notes after May 1, 2008. The initial redemption price is 103.750% of the principal amount, subject to a ratable decline after May 1 of the following year to 100% of the principal amount in 2010 and thereafter. The 7.50% senior notes rank equally with our 5.0% convertible notes, our 3.00% convertible notes, our 3.25% convertible notes, our 7.125% senior notes and our 9 3/8% senior notes and are structurally and effectively junior to indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility, our 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes and our 7.25% senior subordinated notes. The indenture for the 7.50% senior notes contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to incur more debt; guarantee indebtedness; issue preferred stock; pay dividends; make certain investments; merge, consolidate or sell assets; enter into transactions with affiliates; and enter into sale leaseback transactions. • 3.00% Convertible Notes Offering. In August 2004, we sold $345.0 million principal amount of 3.00% convertible notes due August 15, 2012 through an institutional private placement. The 3.00% convertible notes mature on August 15, 2012, and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The 3.00% convertible notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity, subject to their prior redemption or repurchase, into shares of our Class A common stock at a conversion price of approximately $20.50 per share, subject to adjustment in certain events. Upon a fundamental change of control as defined in the notes indenture, the holders of the 3.00% convertible notes may require us to repurchase all or part of the 3.00% convertible notes for a cash purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount. In addition, upon a fundamental change in control, the holders may elect to convert their notes based on a conversion rate adjustment that entitles the holders to receive additional shares of the Company’s Class A common stock upon conversion depending on the terms and timing of the change of control. We may redeem the 3.00% convertible notes on or after August 20, 2009 at an initial redemption price of 101.125% of the principal amount, subject to a ratable decline after August 15 of the following year to 100% of the principal amount in 2012. The 3.00% convertible notes rank equally with our other convertible notes, our 7.125% senior notes, our 7.50% senior notes and our 9 3/8% senior notes and are structurally and effectively junior to indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility, our ATI 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes and our ATI 7.25% senior subordinated notes. • 7.125% Senior Notes Offerings. In October 2004, we sold $300.0 million principal amount of 7.125% senior notes due 2012 through an institutional private placement at a purchase price equal to 100% of face amount. In December 2004, we sold an additional $200.0 million principal amount of 7.125% senior notes due 2012 through an institutional private placement at a purchase price equal to 101.25% of face amount. The 7.125% senior notes mature on October 15, 2012, and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning April 15, 2005. We may redeem the 7.125% senior notes on or after October 15, 2008 at an initial redemption price of 103.563% of the principal amount, subject to a ratable decline after October 15 of the following year to 100% of the principal amount in 2010 and thereafter. The 7.125% senior notes rank equally with our convertible notes, our 7.50% senior notes and our 9 3/8% senior notes and are structurally and effectively junior to indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility, our ATI 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes and our ATI 7.25% senior subordinated notes. The indenture for the 7.125% senior notes contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to incur more debt; guarantee indebtedness; issue preferred stock; pay dividends; make certain investments; merge, consolidate or sell assets; enter into transactions with affiliates; and enter into sale leaseback transactions. 37 Table of Contents Note Redemptions and Repurchases. During 2004, we repurchased and redeemed approximately $1.5 billion in debt securities as follows (in millions): Debt Security Date PrincipalAmount AggregatePrice Redemptions 6.25% Convertible Notes due 2009 February 2004 $ 212.7 $ 217.2 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 September 2004 337.0 360.8 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 November 2004 276.0 293.2 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 (1) January 2005 133.0 139.8 Repurchases ATI 12.25% Senior Subordinated Discount Notes due 2008 (2) 309.7 230.9 9 3/8% Senior Notes due 2009 112.1 118.9 5.0% Convertible Notes due 2010 73.7 73.3 Total $ 1,454.2 $ 1,434.1 (1) On December 6, 2004, we issued a notice for the partial redemption on January 5, 2005 of our 9 3/8% senior notes due 2009. Pursuant to the indenture for the 9 3/8% senior notes, once a notice to redeem is issued, notes called for redemption become irrevocably due and payable on the redemption date. (2) The repurchased amount of $309.7 million represents the face amount at maturity in 2008. On the date of repurchase, such amount had an accreted value of $179.4 million, net of $14.7 million fair value allocated to warrants. • 6.25% Convertible Notes Redemption. In February 2004, we used a portion of the net proceeds from our 7.50% senior notes offering to redeem all of our outstanding $212.7 million principal amount of 6.25% convertible notes. We redeemed these notes pursuant to the terms of the indenture at a purchase price equal to 102.083% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We redeemed these notes for $217.2 million, plus $4.8 million in accrued interest. • 9 3/8% Senior Notes Redemptions. In September 2004, November 2004 and January 2005, we completed the redemption of an aggregate of $746.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 9 3/8% senior notes due 2009, as follows. On September 20, 2004, we redeemed $337.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 9 3/8% senior notes using the net proceeds from our 3.00% convertible notes offering, plus additional cash on hand. We redeemed these notes pursuant to the terms of the indenture at a purchase price equal to 107.07% of the principal amount, for $360.8 million, plus $4.3 million in accrued interest. On November 4, 2004, we redeemed $276.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 9 3/8% senior notes using the net proceeds from our October 2004 7.125% senior notes offering, plus additional cash on hand. We redeemed these notes pursuant to the terms of the indenture at a purchase price equal to 106.23% of the principal amount, for $293.2 million, plus $6.7 million in accrued interest. On January 5, 2005, we redeemed $133.0 million principal amount of our outstanding 9 3/8% senior notes using a portion of net proceeds from our December 2004 7.125% senior notes offering, plus additional cash on hand. We redeemed these notes pursuant to the terms of the indenture at a purchase price equal to 105.11% of the principal amount, for $139.8 million, plus $5.3 million in accrued interest. • Other Debt Repurchases. During the year ended December 31, 2004, in addition to the redemptions discussed above, we repurchased, in privately negotiated transactions, primarily using cash on hand (i) an aggregate of $309.7 million face amount of our ATI 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes ($179.4 million accreted value, net of $14.7 million fair value allocated to warrants) for approximately $230.9 million in cash; (ii) $112.1 million principal amount of our 9 3/8% senior notes for $118.9 million in cash; and (iii) $73.7 million principal amount of our 5.0% convertible notes for approximately $73.3 million in cash. From December 31, 2004 to March 25, 2005, we repurchased an aggregate of $37.0 million face amount of our ATI 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes ($22.6 million accreted value, net of $1.6 million fair value allocated to warrants) for approximately $27.9 million in cash. 38 Table of Contents Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Internally Generated Funds. Because the majority of our tenant leases are multi-year contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of 2004 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it to operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for antenna space on wireless and broadcast communications towers and for related services and our ability to maximize the utilization of our existing towers. Restrictions Under New Credit Facility. The new credit facility with our borrower subsidiaries contains certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guarantees, use of proceeds from asset sales, dividends and other distributions, investments and liens) with which our borrower subsidiaries and restricted subsidiaries must comply. The credit facility contains four financial tests with which we must comply: • a total borrower leverage ratio (Total Debt to Annualized Operating Cash Flow). We are required to maintain a ratio of not greater than 5.50 to 1.00, decreasing to 5.25 to 1.00 at July 1, 2005, to 5.00 to 1.00 at January 1, 2006, to 4.75 to 1.00 at April 1, 2006, to 4.50 to 1.00 at July 1, 2006, and to 4.00 to 1.00 at January 1, 2007 and thereafter; • a senior leverage ratio (Senior Debt to Annualized Operating Cash Flow). We are required to maintain a ratio of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00, decreasing to 3.75 to 1.00 at January 1, 2006, to 3.50 to 1.00 at July 1, 2006, and to 3.00 to 1.00 at January 1, 2007 and thereafter; • an interest coverage ratio (Annualized Operating Cash Flow to Interest Expense). We are required to maintain a ratio of not less than 2.50 to 1.00; and • a fixed charge coverage ratio (Annualized Operating Cash Flow to Fixed Charges). We are required to maintain a ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2004, we were in compliance with all of the foregoing financial tests. Any failure to comply with these covenants would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under our revolving loan, but would also constitute a default. These covenants also restrict our ability, as the parent company, to incur any debt other than that currently outstanding and refinancings of that debt. The credit facility also limits our revolving loan drawdowns based on our cash on hand. In addition to the credit facility, the indentures governing the terms of the ATI 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes and the ATI 7.25% senior subordinated notes contain certain restrictive covenants with which ATI, the sister guarantors and its and their subsidiaries must comply. These include restrictions on their ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions, make certain investments and, as in the credit facility, use the proceeds from asset sales. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default. Specifically, the indentures restrict ATI, each of the sister guarantors and its and their restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock. ATI, the sister guarantors and its and their subsidiaries are permitted, however, to incur debt under our credit facility, or renewals, refundings, replacements or refinancings of them, up to $1.6 billion. The indentures governing the terms of our 9 3/8% senior notes, 7.50% senior notes and 7.125% senior notes also contain certain restrictive covenants with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply. These include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions, make certain investments and, as in the credit facilities, use the proceeds from asset sales. Any 39 Table of Contents failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default. Specifically, the senior note indentures restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock unless our consolidated debt is not greater than 7.5 times our adjusted consolidated cash flow. We are permitted, however, to incur debt under our credit facility even if we are not in compliance with this ratio, or renewals, refundings, replacements or refinancings of our credit facility. If a default occurred under our credit facility or any of our other debt securities, the maturity dates for our outstanding debt could be accelerated, and we likely would be prohibited from making additional borrowings under the credit facility until we cured the default. If this were to occur, we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial ratios defined in the credit facility agreement and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. As outlined above, as of December 31, 2004, our annual consolidated cash debt service obligations (principal and interest) for each of the next five years and thereafter are approximately: $314.5 million, $217.2 million, $493.9 million, $718.5 million, $334.1 million and $2.6 billion, respectively. If we are unable to refinance our subsidiary debt or renegotiate the terms of such debt, we may not be able to meet our debt service requirements in the future. In addition, as a holding company, we depend on distributions or dividends from our subsidiaries, or funds raised through debt and equity offerings, to fund our debt obligations. Although the agreements governing the terms of our credit facility and senior subordinated notes permit our subsidiaries to make distributions to us to permit us to meet our debt service obligations, such terms also significantly limit their ability to distribute cash to us under certain circumstances. Accordingly, if we do not receive sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our debt, and there is no assurance we will succeed in such efforts. Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our debt obligations, and our ability to refinance such debt obligations, will depend on our future financial performance, which is subject to many factors beyond our control, as outlined above under “Factors That May Affect Future Results.” In addition, our ability to refinance any of our debt in the future may depend on our credit ratings from commercial rating agencies, which are dependent on our expected financial performance, the liquidity factors discussed above, and the rating agencies’ outlook for our industry. We expect that we will need to refinance a substantial portion of our debt on or prior to its scheduled maturity in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure such refinancings or, if such refinancings are obtained, that the terms will be commercially reasonable. Capital Markets. Our ability to raise additional funds in the capital markets depends on, among other things, general economic conditions, conditions of the wireless industry, our financial performance and the state of the capital markets. In April 2004, the SEC declared effective our “universal” shelf registration statement for possible future offerings of an aggregate of up to $1.0 billion of debt and/or equity securities, including the offering of shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to a direct stock purchase plan, with respect to which our Board of Directors has approved offerings of up to $150.0 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to income taxes, impairment of assets, allowances for accounts receivable, investment impairment charges and revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method. Management bases its 40 Table of Contents estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. For a discussion of our other accounting policies, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K, beginning on page F-7. • Income Taxes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. At December 31, 2004, we provided a valuation allowance of approximately $173.1 million primarily related to our net state deferred tax assets and capital loss carryforwards. In addition, we also recorded a valuation allowance in 2002 related to a tax planning strategy related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses. The valuation allowance represents the estimated lost tax benefit and costs associated with such strategy. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our tax refund claims and our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as we believe that we will be successful with our tax refund claims and have sufficient time to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty-year tax carryforward period. We intend to recover a portion of our net deferred tax asset through our tax refund claims related to certain federal net operating losses, filed during 2003 as part of a tax planning strategy implemented in 2002. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state (no growth) projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments reducing interest expense. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $1.4 billion in taxable income from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2024. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described above, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense, which would result in a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity. Depending on the resolution of the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings described in notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, we may be entitled to a worthless stock or bad debt deduction for our investment in Verestar. No income tax benefit has been provided for these potential deductions due to the uncertainty surrounding the bankruptcy proceedings. • Impairment of Assets. Assets subject to amortization and non-core assets held for sale: We review long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows. If we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset’s fair market value as compared to its carrying value. 41 Table of Contents We record any related impairment losses in the period in which we identify such impairment. We also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based on management’s best estimate of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition. We record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss. Goodwill—Assets not subject to amortization: As of January 1, 2002, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized, but reviewed for impairment at least annually. SFAS No. 142 also requires that we assess whether goodwill is impaired by performing a transitional impairment test. These tests compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. We completed our transitional impairment testing in the second quarter of 2002 and concluded that all of the goodwill related to our Verestar subsidiary was impaired and that the majority of the goodwill in our network development services segment was impaired. As a result, we recognized a $562.6 million non-cash charge (net of a tax benefit of $14.4 million) related to the write-down of goodwill to its fair value. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, the charge is reflected as of January 1, 2002 and included in the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Fair value estimates were determined based on independent third party appraisals for our rental and management segment and Verestar and future discounted cash flows and market information in our network development services segment. In December 2004, 2003 and 2002, we completed our annual impairment testing related to the goodwill of our rental and management segment (incorporating an independent third party appraisal in 2003 and 2002) and, in all cases, determined that goodwill was not impaired. Fair value estimates are based on our historical and projected operating results and market information, changes to which could affect those fair value estimates. Our December 2002 annual impairment testing also included the remaining goodwill of our Kline subsidiary (the only services business with remaining goodwill) and, based on available market information, we determined that goodwill was not impaired. In June 2003, we committed to a plan to sell Kline, reclassified its net assets to assets held for sale and recorded an impairment charge (inclusive of Kline’s remaining $10.3 million of goodwill) that reduced Kline’s net assets to the estimated fair value expected upon disposal. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test on December 1st of each year and when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. • Allowances for Accounts Receivable. We maintain allowances for accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability to collect amounts billed to our customers. Such amounts approximated $14.0 million as of December 31, 2004. When evaluating the adequacy of the allowances for accounts receivable, we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, current economic trends, changes in our customers’ payment terms, reasons why customer accounts remain unpaid and the age of the receivables. If the basis for our estimates and financial condition of our customers were to change, adjustments to the allowances may be required. • Investment Impairment Charges. Investments in those entities where we own less than twenty percent of the voting securities of the individual entity and do not exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the entity are accounted for using the cost method. Investments in entities where we own less than twenty percent but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the entity or where we own more than twenty percent of the voting securities of the individual entity, but not in excess of fifty percent, are accounted for using the equity method. Our investments are in companies that are not publicly traded, and, therefore, no established market for these securities exists. We have a policy in place to review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the investments in these companies. If we believe that the carrying value of an investment is carried at an amount in excess of fair value, it is our policy to record an impairment charge to adjust the carrying value to the market value. As of December 31, 2004, our only investment was an equity investment with a carrying value of approximately $10.2 million. 42 Table of Contents • Revenue Recognition. A portion of our network development services revenue is derived under contracts or arrangements with customers that provide for billings on a fixed price basis. Revenues under these contracts are recognized using the percentage-of-completion methodology. Under the percentage-of-completion methodology, revenues are recognized in accordance with the percentage of contract costs incurred to date compared to the estimated total contract costs. Due to uncertainties and estimates inherent within percentage-of-completion accounting it is possible that estimates will be revised as project work progresses. Changes to total estimated contract costs or losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R). This Statement is a revision of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”, and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and its related implementation guidance. SFAS No. 123R focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. The statement requires entities to recognize stock compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant-date fair value of those awards (with limited exceptions). SFAS No. 123R is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. We are in the process of evaluating the two methods of adoption allowed by SFAS 123R; the modified-prospective transition method and the modified-retrospective transition method.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long-term debt obligations. We attempt to reduce these risks by utilizing derivative financial instruments, namely interest rate caps. All derivative financial instruments are for purposes other than trading. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we repaid or refinanced approximately $2.0 billion of principal on our outstanding debt, including the refinancing of our previous credit facility of $665.8 million with a new $1.1 billion senior secured credit facility; $40.9 million of principal payments under our credit facility; the redemption of $212.7 million principal amount of our 6.25% convertible notes; the partial redemption and repurchase of $725.1 million principal amount of our 9 3/8% senior notes; and the repurchase of $383.4 million face amount of our other debt securities. In February 2004 and August 2004, we issued $225.0 million principal amount of 7.50% senior notes due May 1, 2012 and $345.0 million principal amount of 3.0% convertible notes due August 15, 2012. We also issued $500.0 million principal amount of 7.125% senior notes due October 15, 2012 in October and December 2004. In June 2004 and July 2004, we entered into two cap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $250.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, and during the year ended December 31, 2003, we had four caps expire with aggregate notional amounts totaling $500.0 million. The following tables provide information as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates. For long-term debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows by maturity date and average interest rates related to outstanding obligations. For interest rate caps, the tables present notional principal amounts and weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.

In January 2004, we refinanced our $267.0 million term loan B under our credit facilities, with a new term loan C due December 31, 2007. The new term loan C has substantially the same terms as term loan B, except that the interest rate spreads for the LIBOR and base rate loans were reduced from 3.5% above LIBOR to 2.25% and from 2.5% above the base rate to 1.25%, respectively. In February 2004, we sold $225.0 million principal amount of 7.50% senior notes due 2012 through an institutional private placement. The net proceeds of the offering were approximately $221.7 million and were used to redeem all of our outstanding 6.25% Notes and to repurchase $4.5 million of our outstanding 5.0% Notes. (b) Includes notional amounts of $250,000 and $100,000 that will expire in June and July 2006, respectively.

Due to the relatively short duration of such instruments, we believe fluctuations in interest rates with respect to those investments will not materially affect our financial condition or results of operations. However, changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt, comprised of $698.0 million under our credit facility as of December 31, 2004. A 10% increase, or approximately 44 basis points, in current interest rates would cause an additional pre-tax charge to our net loss of $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. In addition, changes in interest rates can also cause our cash flows to fluctuate relative to interest payments on variable rate debt. As described above, an increase of 10%, or approximately 44 basis points, in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.",2023-12-30 19:23:26.459358
1053507,AMT,AMERICAN TOWER CORP /MA/,2006,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures in our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” on page 41. Our continuing operations are reported in two business segments: rental and management and network development services. Management focuses on segment profit (loss) as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments. We define segment operating profit (loss) as segment revenues less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense, corporate general, administrative and development expense, and impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense. Segment profit (loss) for the rental and management segment includes interest income, TV Azteca, net (see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements). Executive Overview Our principal operating segment is our rental and management segment, which accounted for approximately 98.4% and 96.9% of our total revenues and approximately 99.5% and 99.3% of our segment operating profit for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The primary factors affecting the stability and growth of our revenues and cash flows for this segment are our recurring revenues from existing tenant leases and the contractual escalators in those leases, leasing additional space on our existing towers, acquiring and building additional tower sites and the degree to which any of our existing customer leases are cancelled. We continue to believe that our leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the continuing growth in the use of wireless communications services and our ability to utilize existing tower capacity. In addition, we believe the majority of our leasing activity will continue to come from wireless broadband-services customers. The majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are for an initial term of five-to-ten years, with multiple five-year renewal terms thereafter. Accordingly, nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of December 2005 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. In addition, most of our leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease. These contractual escalators are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage (generally three-to-five percent), inflation, or a fixed percentage plus inflation. Revenue generated by rate increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable term of the applicable agreement. The revenues generated by our rental and management segment also may be affected by cancellations of existing customer leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multi-year contracts, which typically may not be cancelled or, in some instances, may be cancelled only upon payment of a termination fee. Accordingly, lease cancellations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management segment. During 2005, tenant leases representing less than 2% of our total revenues were cancelled. A significant majority of our revenue growth in 2005 was attributable to revenue generated from leasing space on the towers and in-building systems acquired in connection with our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. In August 2005, we completed our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., an owner and operator of approximately 7,800 wireless and broadcast towers and in-building systems in the United States. The merger was approved by our and SpectraSite’s stockholders on August 3, 2005, and the results of operations of SpectraSite have been included in 25 Table of Contents our consolidated results of operations since that date. During the period August 3, 2005 through December 31, 2005, SpectraSite generated total revenues of $171.2 million and operating profit of $106.8 million. Our revenue growth in 2005 was also attributable to incremental revenue generated by our existing communications sites. During 2005, incremental revenue attributable to those sites that existed during the entire period between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005, was approximately $63.3 million, which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites, contractual escalators net of straight line accounting treatment and favorable currency exchange rate changes, offset by lease cancellations. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and, to a lesser extent, the location of and available capacity on our existing sites. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure, the financial performance of our customers and their access to capital, and general economic conditions. We believe leasing additional space on our existing sites, including the sites acquired in connection with our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., will continue to contribute the substantial majority of our year-over-year revenue growth in 2006. We also generate revenues by building and acquiring new communications sites. In addition to the approximately 7,800 towers and in-building systems acquired in connection with our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., we constructed or acquired 289 and 275 sites in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Because of the nature of our recurring revenues described above, our results of operations only reflect revenues generated on these sites following the respective dates of their construction or acquisition, which affects year-over-year comparisons. During 2005, revenue attributable to these 564 sites that were built or acquired between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005, was approximately $10.8 million. Our rental and management segment operating expenses are comprised of two major categories: direct tower level expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. Our direct tower level expenses consist primarily of ground rent, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and utilities. Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of expenses to support our rental and management and network development services segments, such as sales and property management functions, and are included in our rental and management and network development services segment operating expenses. These segment level expenses exclude corporate, general and administrative expenses, which are included in corporate general, administrative and development expense. In general, our segment level selling, general and administrative expenses do not increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites and increase only modestly year over year. As a result, leasing space to new customers on our existing sites provides significant incremental cash flow. Our profit margin growth is, therefore, directly related to the number of new tenants added to our existing tower sites and the related rental revenue generated in a particular period. 26 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2005 2004 (In thousands) REVENUES: Rental and management $ 929,762 $ 684,422 $ 245,340 36 % Network development services 15,024 22,238 (7,214 ) (32 ) Total revenues 944,786 706,660 238,126 34 OPERATING EXPENSES: Rental and management 306,148 237,312 68,836 29 Network development services 11,981 18,801 (6,820 ) (36 ) Depreciation, amortization and accretion 411,254 329,449 81,805 25 Corporate general, administrative and development expense 37,977 27,468 10,509 38 Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense 34,232 23,876 10,356 43 Total operating expenses 801,592 636,906 164,686 26 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest income, TV Azteca, net of interest expense $1,492 and $1,497 14,232 14,316 (84 ) (1 ) Interest income 4,402 4,844 (442 ) (9 ) Interest expense (222,419 ) (262,237 ) (39,818 ) (15 ) Loss on retirement of long-term obligations (67,110 ) (138,016 ) (70,906 ) (51 ) Other income (expense) 227 (2,798 ) (3,025 ) (108 ) Income tax (provision) benefit (4,003 ) 80,176 (84,179 ) (105 ) Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries (575 ) (2,366 ) (1,791 ) (76 ) Loss on equity method investments (2,078 ) (2,915 ) (837 ) (29 ) Loss from discontinued operations, net (1,935 ) (8,345 ) (6,410 ) (77 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net (35,525 ) 35,525 Net loss $ (171,590 ) $ (247,587 ) $ (75,997 ) (31 )% Total Revenues Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $944.8 million, an increase of $238.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. Approximately $171.2 million of the increase was attributable to revenues generated by SpectraSite. The balance of the increase resulted from an increase in other rental and management revenue of $74.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in network development services revenue of $7.2 million. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $929.8 million, an increase of $245.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. Approximately $171.2 million of the increase was attributable to revenues generated by SpectraSite. Approximately $63.3 million of the increase resulted from incremental revenue generated by communications sites that existed during the entire period between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005, which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites, existing 27 Table of Contents tenants adding more equipment to those sites, contractual escalators net of straight-line accounting treatment and favorable currency exchange rates, offset by lease cancellations. Approximately $10.8 million of the increase resulted from revenue generated by the approximately 560 communications sites acquired and/or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2004, other than in connection with the SpectraSite merger. We believe that our rental and management revenue will increase as we continue to utilize existing site capacity. We anticipate that the majority of our new leasing activity will continue to come from wireless and broadcast service providers. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $15.0 million, a decrease of $7.2 million from year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in revenue was attributable to a decline in revenues generated by our site acquisition, zoning and permitting services, primarily as a result of our strategic focus on our core site leasing business. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenues generated by our structural analysis services, as a result of the increased business associated with our significantly larger site portfolio following our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. As we continue to focus on and grow our site leasing business, and offer only limited services that directly support our site leasing operations and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites, we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to decrease as a percentage of our total revenues. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $801.6 million, an increase of $164.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to an increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense of $81.8 million, an increase in expenses within our rental and management segment of $68.8 million, an increase in corporate general, administrative and development expense of $10.5 million, and an increase in impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense of $10.4 million. These increases were offset by a decrease in expenses within our network development services segment of $6.8 million. We expect our total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 to increase by approximately $35.0 million to $38.0 million related to the January 1, 2006 adoption of SFAS No. 123R regarding equity–based compensation expense, as described below in “—Recent Accounting Pronouncements.” Rental and Management Expense/Segment Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $306.1 million, an increase of $68.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. Approximately $64.4 million of the increase was attributable to expenses incurred by SpectraSite. The balance of the increase resulted primarily from an increase in expenses related to the approximately 560 communications sites acquired and/or constructed since January 1, 2004 other than in connection with the SpectraSite merger, due to their inclusion in our results for a full year in 2005. Rental and management segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $637.8 million, an increase of $176.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. Approximately $106.8 million of the increase was attributable to rental and management segment profit generated by SpectraSite. The balance of the increase resulted primarily from additional revenue from adding tenants to communications sites that existed as of January 1, 2004 and revenue generated on the approximately 560 communications sites acquired and/or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2004 other than in connection with the SpectraSite merger, and the impact of favorable currency exchange rates. Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $12.0 million, a decrease of $6.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. The majority of the decrease correlates directly to the decline in services performed as noted above. 28 Table of Contents Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $411.3 million, an increase of $81.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to approximately $78.0 million of depreciation, amortization and accretion expense related to long-lived assets acquired in connection with the SpectraSite merger and approximately $3.8 million related to other newly acquired or constructed towers and other long-lived assets. We expect our depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 to increase by approximately $131.0 million, including approximately $110.0 million related to the inclusion of a full year of expense related to acquired SpectraSite long-lived assets and approximately $21.0 million related to the acceleration of settlement date assumptions regarding our asset retirement obligations described below. Corporate General, Administrative and Development Expense Corporate general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $38.0 million, an increase of $10.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. Approximately $7.3 million of the increase was attributable to corporate general and administrative expense incurred by SpectraSite. The balance of the increase was primarily attributable to employee bonuses, primarily paid in connection with the closing of the SpectraSite merger. Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long-lived Assets, Restructuring and Merger Related Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $34.2 million, an increase of $10.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was due primarily to merger related expense of $9.0 million incurred in connection with the SpectraSite merger, including employee separation costs of $3.1 million, amortization of unearned compensation relating to unvested stock options assumed of $2.4 million and other employee stock option charges of $3.5 million. Restructuring expense and stock-based compensation expense also increased by $4.6 million related to modified option awards, which was partially offset by a decline of $3.2 million in impairments and net losses on sales of long-lived non-core assets. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $222.4 million, a decrease of $39.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease resulted primarily as a result of the redemption of all of our outstanding 9 3/8% Notes, repurchases of our ATI 12.25% Notes, conversions of our 3.25% Notes and the refinancing of the American Tower credit facility at lower interest rates. This decrease was partially offset by a full year of interest payable on our 7.50% Notes, 3.00% convertible notes due August 15, 2012 (3.00% Notes) Notes and 7.125% Notes issued in February, August and September of 2004, respectively, and approximately $15.2 million of interest expense incurred on the debt assumed in the SpectraSite merger. Loss on Retirement of Long-Term Obligations During the year ended December 31, 2005, we redeemed $274.9 million principal amount of our 9 3/8% Notes, repurchased $177.8 million accreted value of our ATI 12.25% Notes and converted $57.1 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes. In addition, we refinanced the American Tower and SpectraSite credit facilities. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a $67.1 million charge primarily related to the write-off of deferred financing fees and amounts paid in excess of the carrying value. For more information regarding our financing activities, see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Financing Activities” below. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we redeemed all of our outstanding 6.25% convertible notes, redeemed and repurchased portions of our outstanding 9 3/8% Notes, ATI 12.25% Notes and 5.0% convertible notes, and refinanced of our credit facility. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a $138.0 million charge related to the write-off of deferred financing fees and amounts paid in excess of the carrying value. 29 Table of Contents Other Income Other income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $0.2 million, a decrease of $3.0 million from other expense of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease was primarily attributable to approximately $2.9 million of other income generated on interest rate swap agreements assumed in the SpectraSite merger. Income Tax (Provision) Benefit The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $4.0 million, as compared to an $80.2 million tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2004, representing a decrease of $84.2 million from the prior year period. The effective tax rate was 3.1% for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The provision for the year ended December 31, 2005 reflects a $29.5 million charge as a result of a reduction in management’s estimate of the net realizable value of our federal income tax refund claims based upon the current status of the claims, as described below. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to our refund claims as more fully described below and foreign items. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to capital losses and foreign items. We intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset through our federal income tax refund claims related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses. In June 2003 and October 2003, we filed federal income tax refund claims with the IRS relating to the carry back of $380.0 million of net operating losses generated prior to 2003, of which we initially anticipated receiving approximately $90.0 million. Based on preliminary discussions with tax authorities, we revised our estimate of the net realizable value of our federal income tax refund claims and anticipate receiving a refund of approximately $65.0 million as a result of these claims by the end of 2006. There can be no assurances, however, with respect to the specific amount and timing of any refund. Minority Interest in Net Earnings of Subsidiaries Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $0.6 million, a decrease of $1.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease is primarily a result of the Company’s purchase during 2004 of the remaining 12.0% interest in ATC Mexico that it did not own. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net Loss from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $1.9 million, as compared to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily represents the legal costs incurred in connection with our involvement in the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings. We also expect to incur additional costs in connection with these proceedings. The loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes $7.7 million related to the results of operations through the date of sale of our tower construction services unit and Kline, as well as a net loss on disposal of our tower construction services unit of $1.7 million and a $1.1 million net gain related to a contractual obligation that was settled for less than its original estimate. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle, Net As of December 31, 2005, we adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47 “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations” (FIN No. 47). As a result, we recognized a $35.5 million charge (net of an $11.7 million tax benefit) as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. The 30 Table of Contents adoption of FIN No. 47 primarily resulted in the acceleration of settlement date assumptions regarding our asset retirement obligations, as FIN No. 47 precludes us from considering non contractual lease renewal periods in determining our settlement date assumptions. The acceleration of our settlement date assumptions also resulted in an increase to the tower assets included in property and equipment, net of $66.9 million and an increase in the asset retirement obligations included in other long-term obligations of $114.0 million.

The increase resulted from an increase in rental and management revenues of $64.7 million and an increase in network development services revenue of $9.4 million. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $684.4 million, an increase of $64.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase resulted primarily from adding additional wireless and broadband tenants to towers that existed as of January 1, 2003 and, to a lesser extent, from revenue generated on the approximately 900 towers acquired and/or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2003. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in revenue on the approximately 400 owned towers sold or disposed 31 Table of Contents of subsequent to January 1, 2003. In 2004, our revenue growth on towers that existed during the entire period beginning January 1, 2003 and ending December 31, 2004, was approximately $51 million. We believe that our rental and management revenue will continue to grow as we utilize existing tower capacity. We anticipate that the majority of our new leasing activity will continue to come from wireless and broadcast service providers. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $22.2 million, an increase of $9.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in revenues during 2004 resulted primarily from a long-term construction contract that we did not have in the prior year. In October 2004, we entered into an agreement to sell our tower construction services unit. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2004, we reported our tower construction services unit as a discontinued operation. The sale closed in November 2004. After the sale, our network development services segment is focused on providing complementary non-construction services to the rental and management segment, including site acquisition, zoning, permitting and structural analysis. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $636.9 million, an increase of $1.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The principal components of the increase were attributable to expense increases in our network development services segment of $9.3 million, our rental and management segment of $0.6 million and corporate general, administrative and development expense of $0.6 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets and restructuring expense of $7.8 million and in depreciation, amortization and accretion of $1.0 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $237.3 million, an increase of $0.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase resulted primarily from our acquisition/construction of approximately 900 towers partially offset by a reduction in expenses related to the 400 towers that were sold or disposed of subsequent to January 2003, coupled with an overall decrease in rental and management segment expenses. Rental and management segment profit for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $461.4 million, an increase of $64.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase resulted primarily from incremental revenues and operating profit from adding additional broadband tenants to existing towers and newly acquired and/or constructed towers. Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $18.8 million, an increase of $9.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in expenses during 2004 resulted primarily from expenses associated with a long-term construction contract that we did not have in the prior year. Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long-Lived Assets and Restructuring Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets and restructuring expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $23.9 million, a decrease of $7.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The majority of the decrease resulted from decreased impairments and losses on sales of long-lived tower and other non-core assets. 32 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $262.2 million, a decrease of $17.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease resulted primarily from the retirement of a portion of our 9 3/8% Notes and ATI 12.25% Notes partially offset by additional interest incurred related to the issuance of our 3.00% Notes, 7.125% Notes and 7.50% Notes in 2004. Loss on Retirement of Long-Term Obligations During the year ended December 31, 2004, we retired all or a portion of our 6.25% convertible notes, 9 3/8% Notes and ATI 12.25% Notes. As a result, we incurred a charge of approximately $103.2 million, which represented the cash paid in excess of the carrying value of the debt at the time of retirement. In addition, we also incurred a charge of $34.8 million related to the write-off of deferred financing fees related to the retirements discussed above, the retirement of a portion of our 5.0% convertible notes and the refinancing of our credit facility. The total of these charges, $138.0 million, represents our loss on retirement of long-term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we amended our credit facility and made certain prepayments and unscheduled principal payments on the term loans thereunder, which collectively reduced the borrowing capacity under our credit facility. As a result, we recorded an aggregate charge of approximately $11.9 million related to the write-off of deferred financing fees associated with the reduction in our overall borrowing capacity. We also repurchased a portion of our 2.25% convertible notes and 5.0% convertible notes (inclusive of the cash tender offer for our 2.25% convertible notes that expired on October 22, 2003) throughout the year. As a result, we incurred an aggregate charge of approximately $34.3 million, which primarily represented the fair market value of the shares of stock issued to our 2.25% convertible note holders in excess of the shares originally issuable upon conversion of the notes, offset by a net gain on the repurchases of our 5.0% convertible notes. The total of these charges, $46.2 million, represents our loss on retirement of long-term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2003. Other Expense Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $2.8 million, a decrease of $5.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease resulted primarily from fees and expenses incurred in 2003 in connection with a financing transaction that we did not consummate as a result of the ATI 12.25% Notes offering. Income Tax Benefit The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $80.2 million, an increase of $2.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The effective tax rate was 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to 24.5% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The primary reason for the increase in the effective tax rate is a result of non-deductible losses on retirements of our debt in 2003. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to capital losses and foreign items. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to our capital losses, foreign items and non-deductible losses on retirement of our debt. In June 2003 and October 2003, we filed income tax refund claims with the IRS relating to carrying back of $380.0 million of net operating losses generated prior to 2003. As of December 31, 2004, we anticipated receiving a refund of approximately $90.0 million as a result of these claims and estimated recovery of these amounts within two to three years of the dates the claims were filed with the IRS. 33 Table of Contents Loss on Equity Method Investments Loss on equity method investments for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $2.9 million, a decrease of $18.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease is primarily due to an impairment charge recorded on one of our equity investments of $19.3 million in 2003. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net Loss from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $8.3 million, as compared to $60.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. In October 2004, we committed to a plan to sell our tower construction services unit, which was subsequently sold in November 2004. In addition, we sold Kline in March 2004. Accordingly, the loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes $7.7 million related to the results of these operations through the date of sale. In addition, the loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes a net loss on disposal of our tower construction services unit of $1.7 million and a $1.1 million net gain related to a contractual obligation that was settled for less than its original estimate. During 2003, we disposed of two of our wholly owned subsidiaries, Galaxy Engineering and Flash Technologies, two office buildings and two subsidiaries of Verestar. Accordingly, the loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes $12.0 million related to the results of these operations, Kline and the remaining operations of Verestar through the date of its bankruptcy filing in December 2003. In addition to the above, loss from discontinued operations, net, for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes the following net losses on disposal: (a) an impairment charge of $26.5 million to reduce the carrying amount of our investment in Verestar to zero and to record our estimate of costs that we may incur under certain contractual obligations; (b) an impairment charge of $14.6 million to reduce the carrying value of Kline’s net assets to the estimated proceeds expected upon disposal; (c) a $2.4 million net loss on the disposal of Galaxy; (d) a $3.7 million net loss on the disposal of the office buildings; and (e) a $0.1 million net gain on the sale of Flash. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview During the year ended December 31, 2005, we improved our financial flexibility by refinancing our existing debt with less restrictive, lower cost capital, which increased our liquidity and our ability to return value to our stockholders. Significant transactions included the following: • In October 2005, we refinanced the two existing credit facilities of our principal operating subsidiaries. We replaced the existing American Tower $1.1 billion senior secured credit facility with a new $1.3 billion senior secured credit facility and replaced the existing SpectraSite $900.0 million senior secured credit facility with a new $1.15 billion senior secured credit facility. • During 2005, consistent with our strategy of replacing our higher cost, more restrictive debt with less expensive, less restrictive capital, we repurchased, redeemed and converted approximately $605.7 million face amount of our outstanding debt securities. In addition, in December 2005, we issued a notice for the redemption of the remaining outstanding $227.7 million face amount of ATI 12.25% Notes, which we redeemed on February 1, 2006. Upon completion of this redemption, no ATI 12.25% Notes remained outstanding. • In November 2005, we announced that our board of directors had approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we intend to repurchase up to $750.0 million of our Class A common stock through December 2006. As of December 31, 2005, we had repurchased 2.8 million shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate of $76.6 million. As of December 31, 2005, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $3.6 billion. We incurred substantially all of this indebtedness to refinance indebtedness incurred prior to 2002 to fund the acquisition of 34 Table of Contents tower sites and services businesses, and capital expenditures related to the construction of new tower sites. Beginning in 2002, we significantly reduced our acquisitions and new tower construction activities, and began to focus on reducing our overall indebtedness. In 2003, 2004 and 2005, we continued this effort by refinancing indebtedness to extend maturity dates, reduce interest expense and improve our financial flexibility, and since 2004, by using cash flow from operations to repurchase and redeem outstanding debt to reduce our net total indebtedness. In 2005, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and cash interest obligations. We believe our cash generated by operations for the year ending December 31, 2006 also will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and our cash debt service (interest and principal repayments) obligations for 2006. For information about our outstanding indebtedness, see “—Contractual Obligations” below. We expect our 2006 cash needs related to indebtedness outstanding as of December 31, 2005, to consist primarily of the following: debt service, including cash interest of approximately $189.0 million, approximately $179.5 million for the February 1, 2006 redemption of the remaining outstanding ATI 12.25% Notes, and capital lease payments and other notes payable (including interest) of approximately $5.2 million. We expect to fund capital expenditures of between $110.0 and $130.0 million, principally related to new tower construction, improvements to existing towers and installation of new in-building systems in 2006. We also expect to use approximately $22.7 million in cash to purchase the remaining shares of ATC South America that we do not own, as discussed above in “Business—Recent Transactions—ATC International Transactions.” In addition, we expect to continue to fund our stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we intend to purchase up to an additional $673.4 million of our Class A common stock in 2006. We also may fund additional purchases of our Class A common stock, either pursuant to, or supplemental to, our stock repurchase program. We expect to meet these cash needs through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Uses of Cash Stock Repurchase Program. In November 2005, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $750.0 million of our Class A common stock through December 2006. We expect to utilize cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities and cash on hand to fund the repurchase program. Under the program, our management is authorized to purchase shares from time to time in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. To facilitate repurchases, we entered into a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self- imposed trading blackout periods. The program may be discontinued at any time. As of December 31, 2005, we had repurchased 2.8 million shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate of $76.6 million. Between January 1, 2006 and March 9, 2006, we repurchased an additional 3.9 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate of $117.4 million pursuant to our stock repurchase program. Tower Construction and Improvements and In-Building System Installation. During the year ended December 31, 2005, payments for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities totaled $88.6 million, including capital expenditures incurred in connection with the construction of 245 towers and the installation of 14 in-building systems. We plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that can provide the highest potential returns in light of existing market conditions. Accordingly, we may continue to acquire communications sites, build or install new communications sites and redevelop or improve existing communications sites when the expected returns on such investments meet our investment criteria. We anticipate that in 2006 we will build approximately 275 new towers and install approximately 40 new in-building systems, and expect our 2006 total capital expenditures for construction, improvements and corporate purposes to be between approximately $110.0 million and $130.0 million. Refinancing and Repurchases of Debt. In order to extend the maturity dates of our indebtedness, reduce interest expense and improve our financial flexibility, we use our cash to refinance and repurchase our 35 Table of Contents outstanding indebtedness. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we repurchased, redeemed and converted approximately $605.7 million face amount of our outstanding debt securities. For more information about our financing activities, see “—Financing Activities” below. In October 2005, we also refinanced the American Tower credit facility and the SpectraSite credit facility with new credit facilities. (See “—Sources of Cash” below.) In addition, in December 2005, we issued a notice for the redemption of the remaining outstanding $227.7 million face amount of ATI 12.25% Notes, which we redeemed on February 1, 2006. (See “—Financing Activities” below.) Contractual Obligations. Our contractual obligations relate primarily to borrowings under the credit facilities and our outstanding notes. The following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations payable in cash as of December 31, 2005 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total American Tower credit facility (1) Revolving credit facility Term Loan A $ 750,000 $ 750,000 Delayed Draw Term Loan 43,000 43,000 SpectraSite credit facility (1) Revolving credit facility Term Loan A 700,000 700,000 Delayed Draw Term Loan 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes (2) $ 179,488 179,488 7.25% senior subordinated notes $ 400,000 400,000 7.50% senior notes 225,000 225,000 7.125% senior notes 500,000 500,000 5.0% convertible notes (3) $ 275,688 275,688 3.25% convertible notes 152,911 152,911 3.00% convertible notes 345,000 345,000 2.25% convertible notes 47 47 Long-term obligations, excluding capital leases and other notes payable 179,535 275,688 1,645,911 1,470,000 3,571,134 Cash interest expense (1)(2) 189,000 177,000 $ 175,000 $ 175,000 161,000 138,000 1,015,000 Capital lease payments (including interest) and other notes payable 5,241 4,395 4,025 3,719 3,776 212,743 233,899 Operating lease payments (4) 190,129 183,595 180,910 178,456 172,060 2,507,444 3,412,594 Other long-term liabilities (5) 400 1,098 437 450 463 165,071 167,919 Total $ 564,305 $ 641,776 $ 360,372 $ 357,625 $ 1,983,210 $ 4,493,258 $ 8,400,546 (1) For more information regarding the American Tower and SpectraSite credit facilities, see “—Sources of Cash” below. Interest rates for the revolving loan and the term loan components of each of the credit facilities are determined at the option of the borrowers under the facility and range between 0.50% and 1.25% above the applicable London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.0% and 0.25% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on the applicable borrowers’ debt ratings. A quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of each credit facility is required, ranging from 0.10% to 0.375% per annum, based on the applicable borrowers’ debt ratings. As discussed in Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” we have entered into swap agreements to manage exposure to variable rate interest obligations under the credit facilities. As a result of these swap agreements, the effective weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2005 for the credit facilities was 4.71%. For projections of our cash interest expense related to the credit facilities, we have assumed the LIBOR rate before the margin, as defined in our credit facilities agreements, is 4.53% through their maturity on October 27, 2010. (2) The ATI 12.25% Notes accrue no cash interest. Instead, the accreted value of each note increases between the date of original issuance and maturity (August 1, 2008) at a rate of 12.25% per annum. As of December 31, 2005, the remaining 36 Table of Contents outstanding debt under the ATI 12.25% Notes was $227.7 million face amount ($160.3 million accreted value, net of $7.2 million fair value allocated to warrants). On December 22, 2005, we issued a notice for the redemption on February 1, 2006, of all remaining outstanding ATI 12.25% Notes. Pursuant to the indenture for the notes, once a notice to redeem is issued, notes called for redemption become irrevocably due and payable on the redemption date. On February 1, 2006 we redeemed $227.7 million face amount of ATI 12.25% Notes in accordance with the indenture at 106.125% of their accreted value for an aggregate of $179.5 million. Upon completion of this redemption, no ATI 12.25% Notes remained outstanding. (3) The holders of our 5.0% convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on specified dates prior to their maturity date in 2010, but we may pay the purchase price by issuing shares of our Class A common stock, subject to certain conditions. The obligation with respect to the right of the holders to put the 5.0% convertible notes on February 20, 2007, has been classified as a cash obligation for 2007. (4) Operating lease payments include payments to be made under non-cancelable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable tower site and related revenues from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that we will renew the lease. (5) Primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other long-term liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily our straight-line rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash. The above table does not include certain commitments relating to the construction of tower sites under existing build to suit agreements as of December 31, 2005, as we cannot currently estimate the timing and amounts of such payments. (See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.) Sources of Cash American Tower Corporation is a holding company, and our cash flows are derived solely from distributions from our operating subsidiaries. Our principal United States operating subsidiaries are ATI and SpectraSite. Our principal international operating subsidiary is American Tower International, Inc. Under the American Tower credit facility and the indentures for our senior notes and the ATI notes, ATI and American Tower International are subject to restrictions on the amount of cash that can be distributed to us. SpectraSite is subject to restrictions on the amount of cash that can be distributed to us under the SpectraSite credit facility, but as a result of its designation as an unrestricted subsidiary, it is not subject to such restrictions under the indentures for our senior notes and the ATI notes. Total Liquidity at December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $1.047 billion of total liquidity, comprised of approximately $112.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to borrow approximately $488.8 million under the American Tower credit facility and approximately $445.4 million under the SpectraSite credit facility. Cash Generated by Operations. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, our cash provided by operating activities was $397.2 million, $216.7 million and $156.4 million, respectively. Each of our rental and management and network development services segments are expected to generate cash flows from operations during 2006 in excess of their cash needs for operations and expenditures for tower construction, improvements and acquisitions. (See “—Results of Operations” above.) We expect to use the excess cash generated by operations principally to service our debt and to fund capital expenditures and repurchases of our Class A common stock. New Credit Facilities. In October 2005, we refinanced the two existing credit facilities of our principal operating subsidiaries. We replaced the existing American Tower $1.1 billion senior secured credit facility with a new $1.3 billion senior secured credit facility and replaced the existing SpectraSite $900.0 million senior secured credit facility with a new $1.15 billion senior secured credit facility. The new American Tower credit facility consists of a $300.0 million revolving credit facility, a $750.0 million Term Loan A, and a $250.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan. At closing, we drew down the entire 37 Table of Contents Term Loan A and used the net proceeds to repay principal and interest on the outstanding $745.0 million under the previous American Tower credit facility. At closing, we had approximately $300.0 million of availability under the revolving credit facility, against which approximately $18.2 million of undrawn letters of credit were outstanding, and had the ability to draw down the entire $250.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan. In December 2005, we drew down $43.0 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loan to finance repurchases of the ATI 12.25% Notes. In January 2006, we drew down an additional $179.0 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loan to finance the redemption of the remaining outstanding ATI 12.25% Notes. The credit facility provides that any portion of the Delayed Draw Term Loan that is not drawn as of October 27, 2006 will be canceled. The borrowers under the American Tower credit facility include ATI, American Tower, L.P., American Tower International and American Tower LLC. We and the borrowers’ restricted subsidiaries (as defined in the loan agreement) have guaranteed all of the loans under the credit facility. These loans are secured by liens on and security interests in substantially all assets of the borrowers and the restricted subsidiaries. The American Tower credit facility has a term of five years, maturing on October 27, 2010, and all amounts will be due and payable in full at maturity. The American Tower credit facility does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at the borrowers’ option without penalty or premium. For more information regarding the new American Tower credit facility, please see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. The new SpectraSite credit facility consists of a $250.0 million revolving credit facility, a $700.0 million Term Loan A, and a $200.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan. At closing, we drew down the entire Term Loan A and used the net proceeds to repay principal and interest on the $697.0 million outstanding under the previous SpectraSite credit facility. At closing, we had approximately $250.0 million of availability under the revolving credit facility, against which approximately $4.6 million of undrawn letters of credit were outstanding, and had the ability to draw down the entire $200.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan. The credit facility provides that any portion of the Delayed Draw Term Loan that is not drawn as of October 27, 2006 will be canceled. The borrower under the SpectraSite credit facility is SpectraSite Communications. SpectraSite Communications, its parent company (SpectraSite, LLC), and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined in the loan agreement) have guaranteed all of the loans under the credit facility. These loans are secured by liens on and security interests in substantially all assets of the borrower and the restricted subsidiaries. The SpectraSite credit facility has a term of five years, maturing on October 27, 2010, and all amounts will be due and payable in full at maturity. The SpectraSite credit facility does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at the borrower’s option without penalty or premium. For more information regarding the new SpectraSite credit facility, see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. Proceeds from the Sale of Equity Securities. We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our stock option and stock purchase plans and upon exercise of warrants to purchase our equity securities. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we received approximately $1.8 million in proceeds from exercises of warrants to purchase shares of our Class A common stock and approximately $63.6 million in proceeds from sales of shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to our stock option and stock purchase plans. Financing Activities 9 3/8% Notes Redemptions. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we redeemed an aggregate of $274.9 million principal amount of our 9 3/8% Notes, representing all of the outstanding 9 3/8% Notes. We completed partial redemptions of the 9 3/8% Notes in accordance with the terms of the indenture in January, July and September 2005 for an aggregate redemption price of $288.3 million, plus approximately $9.5 million in accrued interest. ATI 12.25% Notes Repurchases. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we repurchased an aggregate of $270.6 million face amount of our ATI 12.25% Notes ($177.8 million accreted value, net of $10.1 million fair 38 Table of Contents value allocated to warrants) for approximately $208.4 million in cash, in privately negotiated transactions. As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding $227.7 face amount of our ATI 12.25% Notes ($160.3 million accreted value, net of $7.2 million fair value allocated to warrants). In December 2005, we issued a notice for the redemption of the remaining outstanding ATI 12.25% Notes. On February 1, 2006, we redeemed an aggregate of $227.7 million face amount of ATI 12.25% Notes in accordance with the indenture at 106.125% of their accreted value for an aggregate of $179.5 million. Upon completion of this redemption, no ATI 12.25% Notes remained outstanding. 3.25% Convertible Notes Conversions. During the year ended December 31, 2005, holders of an aggregate of $57.1 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes converted their notes into an aggregate of 4.7 million shares of our Class A common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture, the holders of the 3.25% Notes received 81.808 shares of our Class A common stock for every $1,000 principal amount of notes converted. In connection with the conversion, we paid such holders an aggregate of $4.9 million, calculated based on the accrued and unpaid interest on the notes and the discounted value of future interest payments on the notes. As of December 31, 2005, $152.9 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes remained outstanding. Between January 1, 2006 and March 9, 2006, holders of an additional $22.5 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes converted their notes into an aggregate of 1.8 million shares of our Class A common stock. In connection with the conversion, we paid such holders an aggregate of $1.7 million, calculated based on the accrued and unpaid interest on the notes and the discounted value of future interest payments on the notes. Interest Rate Swap Agreements. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we entered into eight interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to variable rate interest obligations under our new credit facilities. The swaps have an aggregate notional amount of $450.0 million, a weighted average fixed rate of approximately 4.85% and expire in October 2010. During January 2006, we also entered into two additional interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $100.0 million, a weighted average fixed rate of approximately 4.68% and will expire in October 2010. We have designated these swaps as cash flow hedges. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Internally Generated Funds. Because the majority of our tenant leases are multi-year contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of 2005 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it to operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for antenna space on wireless and broadcast communications towers and for related services and our ability to maximize the utilization of our existing towers. Restrictions Under Credit Facilities. The American Tower and SpectraSite credit facilities contain certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which the borrowers and their restricted subsidiaries must comply. Each credit facility contains the following two financial maintenance tests with which the borrowers under the applicable credit facility must comply: • a leverage ratio (Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than 5.50 to 1.00 for the borrowers and their restricted subsidiaries; and • an interest coverage ratio (Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense) of not less than 2.50 to 1.00 for the borrowers and their restricted subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with all of the foregoing financial tests. Any failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the American Tower credit facility or the SpectraSite credit facility would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the 39 Table of Contents revolving loans, but would constitute a default, resulting in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. The credit facilities allow us to use borrowings for general corporate purposes and, provided certain conditions are met, permit the use of borrowings under the credit facilities and internally generated funds to repurchase our equity securities and repurchase and refinance other indebtedness without additional lender approval. Restrictions Under Notes Indentures. The indenture governing the terms of the ATI 7.25% Notes contains certain covenants which further restrict ATI, the sister guarantors (as defined) and its and their subsidiaries in addition to the restrictions set forth in the American Tower credit facility. These include restrictions on their ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments. SpectraSite and its subsidiaries are unrestricted subsidiaries under the indenture for the ATI 7.25% Notes and are not subject to such restrictions. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default. Specifically, the indenture restricts ATI, the sister guarantors and its and their restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock, other than debt under the American Tower credit facility, or renewals, refundings, replacements or refinancings, up to $1.6 billion. The indentures governing the terms of our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes also contain certain restrictive covenants with which we and the restricted subsidiaries under these indentures must comply. These include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments. SpectraSite and its subsidiaries are unrestricted subsidiaries under the indentures for our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes and are not subject to such restrictions. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default. Specifically, these indentures restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock unless our consolidated debt is not greater than 7.5 times our adjusted consolidated cash flow. We are permitted, however, to incur debt under our credit facilities even if we are not in compliance with this ratio, or renewals, refundings, replacements or refinancings of our credit facilities. If a default occurred under any of our credit facilities or other debt securities, the maturity dates for our outstanding debt could be accelerated, and we likely would be prohibited from making additional borrowings under the credit facilities until we cured the default. If this were to occur, we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial ratios defined in the credit facilities agreements and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. As of December 31, 2005, our annual consolidated cash debt service obligations (principal and interest) for each of the next five years and thereafter are approximately: $373.8 million, $457.1 million, $179.0 million, $178.7 million, $1.8 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. In addition, as a holding company, we depend on distributions or dividends from our subsidiaries, or funds raised through debt and equity offerings, to fund our debt obligations. Although the agreements governing the terms of our credit facilities and the indenture for the ATI 7.25% Notes permit our subsidiaries to make distributions to us to permit us to meet our debt service obligations, such terms also significantly limit their ability to distribute cash to us under certain circumstances. Accordingly, if we do not receive sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our debt, and there is no assurance we will succeed in such efforts. Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our debt obligations, and our ability to refinance such debt obligations, will depend on our future financial performance, which is subject to many factors beyond our control, as outlined above in Item 1A of this annual report under the caption “Risk Factors.” In addition, our ability to refinance any of our debt in the future may depend on our credit ratings from commercial rating agencies, which are dependent on our expected financial performance, the liquidity factors discussed above, and the rating agencies’ outlook for our industry. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure such refinancings or, if such refinancings are obtained, that the terms will be commercially reasonable. 40 Table of Contents Capital Markets. Our ability to raise additional funds in the capital markets depends on, among other things, general economic conditions, conditions of the wireless industry, our financial performance and the state of the capital markets. In April 2004, the SEC declared effective our “universal” shelf registration statement for possible future offerings of an aggregate of up to $1.0 billion of debt and/or equity securities. As of December 31, 2005, we had not conducted any offerings pursuant to our universal shelf registration statement. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to income taxes, purchase price allocation, asset retirement obligations, impairment of assets and revenue recognition. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. For a discussion of our other accounting policies, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, beginning on page F-7. • Income Taxes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. At December 31, 2005, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $422.4 million, including approximately $249.5 million attributable to SpectraSite, primarily related to certain net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards. Approximately $237.8 million of the SpectraSite valuation allowance was assumed as of the acquisition date. The balance of the valuation allowance primarily relates to net state deferred tax assets. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as we believe that we will have sufficient time to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty-year tax carryforward period. We intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset through our federal income tax refund claims related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses. In June 2003 and October 2003, we filed federal income tax refund claims with the IRS relating to the carry back of $380.0 million of net operating losses generated prior to 2003, of which we initially anticipated receiving approximately $90.0 million. Based on preliminary discussions with tax authorities, we revised our estimate of the net realizable value of our federal income tax refund claims and anticipate receiving a refund of approximately $65.0 million as a result of these claims by the end of 2006. There can be no assurances, however, with respect to the specific amount and timing of any refund. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state (no growth) projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation and interest expense in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period and debt repayments reducing interest expense. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax 41 Table of Contents assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $1.3 billion in taxable income from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2025. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described above, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense. From time to time, we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations, and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded a $29.5 million income tax provision to reflect a reduction in management’s estimate of the net realizable value of our pending federal tax refund claims as described above. We believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December 31, 2005. Depending on the resolution of the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings described in notes 3 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, we may be entitled to a worthless stock or bad debt deduction for our investment in Verestar. No income tax benefit has been provided for these potential deductions due to the uncertainty surrounding the bankruptcy proceedings. • Purchase Price Allocation. We account for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141 “Business Combinations” (SFAS No. 141), which provides that purchase prices be allocated to the net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. In the case of tower assets acquired through the purchase of a business, such as our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition, and the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as residual goodwill. We completed our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. in August 2005 for a total preliminary purchase price of approximately $3.1 billion, including the fair value of shares of Class A common stock issued, the fair value of options and warrants assumed and estimated transaction costs. We are in the process of finalizing a third-party valuation of SpectraSite’s property and equipment, intangible assets and certain other assets and liabilities. Given the size of the SpectraSite transaction, the values of certain assets and liabilities are based on preliminary valuations and are subject to adjustment as additional information on management’s estimates and assumptions is obtained and the third-party valuation is finalized. The primary areas of the purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the fair values of property and equipment, intangibles, restructuring and merger related liabilities, other assumed liabilities, deferred income taxes and residual goodwill of approximately $1.5 billion. Changes to the valuation of these items may result in adjustments to the overall purchase price allocation of these items and the related depreciation and amortization. • Asset Retirement Obligations. We comply with the provisions of SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” (SFAS No. 143) and the provisions of FIN No. 47. Both pronouncements address the financial accounting and reporting requirements for conditional obligations associated with our legal obligation to retire tangible long-lived assets and the related asset retirement costs, principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of our tower assets are located. Under these accounting principles, we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made, and we accrete such liability through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. The associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets and depreciated over their estimated useful life. As of December 31, 2005, we adopted the provisions of FIN No. 47 and recognized a $35.5 million charge (net of an $11.7 million tax benefit) as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. This adoption also increased our aggregate asset retirement obligation by approximately $114.0 million to $164.2 million as of December 31, 2005 and resulted in an increase to tower assets included in property and equipment, net of $66.9 million. The adoption of FIN No. 47 primarily resulted in the acceleration of our settlement date assumptions, as FIN No. 47 precludes us from considering non contractual lease renewal periods in 42 Table of Contents determining our settlement date assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows, and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense. The significant assumptions used in estimating the Company’s aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary. • Impairment of Assets. Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization and Non-Core Long-Lived Assets Held for Sale: We review long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or our review of our tower portfolio indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Our tower portfolio review includes sites for which we have no current tenant leases. We assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows, as well as through other analytical methods. If we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset’s fair market value as compared to its carrying value. We record any related impairment losses in the period in which we identify such impairment. We also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based on management’s best estimate of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition. We record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss. Goodwill—Assets Not Subject to Amortization: We perform our annual goodwill impairment test on December 1 of each year and when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. In December 2005, 2004 and 2003, we completed our annual impairment testing related to the goodwill of our rental and management segment and determined that goodwill was not impaired. Fair value estimates are based on our historical and projected operating results and market information, changes to which could affect those fair value estimates. Our December 2005 annual impairment testing included $1.5 billion of goodwill acquired in our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. • Revenue Recognition. Rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned, regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts. Fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancelable lease agreements, excluding those tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our customers are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the applicable leases. Straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 approximated $30.3 million, $24.8 million and $22.9 million respectively. Amounts billed up-front for certain services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases. Amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until such time as the earnings process is complete. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS 123R). SFAS 123R revises SFAS No. 123 “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (SFAS 123), supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” (APB No. 25) and amends SFAS No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.” This statement addressed the accounting for share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options. Under the new standard, companies will no longer be able to account for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method in accordance 43 Table of Contents with APB No. 25. Instead, companies will be required to account for such transactions using a fair-value method and recognize the related expense associated with share-based payments in the statement of operations. SFAS 123R is effective for us as of January 1, 2006. We have historically accounted for share-based payments to employees under APB No. 25’s intrinsic value method. As such, we generally have not recognized compensation expense for options granted to employees. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R under the modified prospective method, in which compensation cost for all share-based payments granted or modified after the effective date is recognized based upon the requirements of SFAS 123R, and compensation cost for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that are unvested as of the effective date of SFAS 123R is recognized based on SFAS 123. Tax benefits will be recognized related to the cost for share-based payments to the extent the equity instrument would ordinarily result in a future tax deduction under existing law. Tax expense will be recognized to write off excess deferred tax assets when the tax deduction upon settlement of a vested option is less than the expense recorded in the statement of operations (to the extent not offset by prior tax credits for settlements where the tax deduction was greater than the fair value cost). We estimate that we will recognize equity-based compensation expense of approximately $35 million to $38 million for the year ending December 31, 2006. This amount is subject to revisions as we finalize certain assumptions related to 2006, including the size and nature of awards and forfeiture rates. SFAS 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as operating cash flow as was previously required. We cannot estimate what the future tax benefits will be as the amounts depend on, among other factors, future employee stock option exercises. Due to the our tax loss position, there was no operating cash inflow realized for December 31, 2005 and 2004 for such excess tax deductions. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107 regarding the Staff’s interpretation of SFAS 123R. This interpretation provides the Staff’s views regarding interactions between SFAS 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share-based payments for public companies. The interpretive guidance is intended to assist companies in applying the provisions of SFAS 123R and investors and users of the financial statements in analyzing the information provided. We will follow the guidance prescribed in SAB No. 107 in connection with our adoption of SFAS 123R.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long-term debt obligations. We attempt to reduce these risks by utilizing derivative financial instruments, namely interest rate swaps and caps. All derivative financial instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we repurchased, redeemed and converted $605.7 million face amount of outstanding debt securities for $501.7 million in cash, including the repurchase of $270.6 million face amount ($177.8 million accreted value) of ATI 12.25% Notes, the redemption of $274.9 million principal amount of 9 3/8% Notes and the conversion of $57.1 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes. In connection with our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. we also assumed $702.5 million of debt at fair value consisting primarily of borrowings outstanding under the previous SpectraSite credit facility. The following tables provide information as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates. For long-term debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows by maturity date and average interest rates related to outstanding obligations. For interest rate caps and swaps, the tables present notional principal amounts and weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.

1053507,AMT,AMERICAN TOWER CORP /MA/,2007,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures in our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” on page 46. Our continuing operations are reported in two business segments: rental and management and network development services. Management focuses on segment gross margin and segment operating profit (loss) as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments. We define segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization and accretion; selling, general, administrative and development expense; and impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense. We define segment operating profit as segment gross margin less selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. Segment gross margin and segment operating profit (loss) for the rental and management segment include interest income, TV Azteca, net (see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included herein). Executive Overview Our principal operating segment is our rental and management segment, which accounted for approximately 98.2% and 98.4% of our total revenues and approximately 99.2% and 99.5% of our segment operating profit for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The primary factors affecting the stability and growth of our revenues and cash flows for this segment are our recurring revenues from existing tenant leases and the contractual escalators in those leases, leasing additional space on our existing towers, acquiring and building additional tower sites and the degree to which any of our existing customer leases are cancelled. We continue to believe that our leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the continuing growth in the use of wireless communications services and our ability to utilize existing tower capacity. In addition, we believe the majority of our leasing activity will continue to come from customers providing wireless broadband-services. The majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are for an initial term of five to ten years, with multiple five-year renewal terms thereafter. Accordingly, nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of December 2006 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. In addition, most of our leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease. These contractual escalators are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage (generally three to five percent), inflation, or a fixed percentage plus inflation. Revenue generated by rate increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable term of the applicable agreement. The revenues generated by our rental and management segment also may be affected by cancellations of existing customer leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multi-year contracts, which typically may not be cancelled or, in some instances, may be cancelled only upon payment of a termination fee. Accordingly, lease cancellations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management segment. During 2006, tenant leases representing less than 2% of our total revenues were cancelled. A significant majority of our revenue growth in 2006 was attributable to revenue generated from leasing space on the towers and in-building systems acquired in connection with our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. In August 2005, we completed our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., an owner and operator of approximately 7,800 28 Table of Contents wireless and broadcast towers and in-building systems in the United States. The merger was approved by our and SpectraSite’s stockholders on August 3, 2005, and the results of operations of SpectraSite have been included in our consolidated results of operations since that date. During the year ended December 31, 2006 and during the period August 3, 2005 through December 31, 2005, SpectraSite contributed total revenues of $445.4 million and $171.2 million, respectively, and segment operating profit of $294.2 million and $106.8 million, respectively, to our rental and management segment. Our revenue growth in 2006 was also attributable to incremental revenue generated by our existing communications sites. During 2006, incremental revenue attributable to those sites that existed during the entire period between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006, was approximately $79.1 million, which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites, the effects of straight-line accounting treatment of contractual escalators in our tenant leases and favorable currency exchange rate changes, offset by lease cancellations. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and, to a lesser extent, the location of and available capacity on our existing sites. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure, the financial performance of our customers and their access to capital, and general economic conditions. We believe leasing additional space on our existing sites, including the sites acquired in connection with our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., will contribute the substantial majority of our year-over-year revenue growth in 2007. We also generate revenues by building and acquiring new communications sites. In addition to the approximately 7,800 towers and in-building systems acquired in connection with our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., we constructed or acquired 325 and 289 sites in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Because of the nature of our recurring revenues described above, our results of operations only reflect revenues generated on these sites following the respective dates of their construction or acquisition, which affects year-over-year comparisons. During 2006, incremental revenue attributable to these 614 sites that were built or acquired between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006, was approximately $11.0 million. Our rental and management segment operating expenses include our direct tower level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and utilities. These segment level expenses exclude all segment and corporate, selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling, general, administrative and development expense. Our segment level selling, general and administrative expenses consist of expenses to support our rental and management and network development services segments, such as sales and property management functions. In general, our segment level selling, general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites and increase only modestly year over year. As a result, leasing space to new customers on our existing sites provides significant incremental cash flow. Our profit margin growth is, therefore, directly related to the number of new tenants added to our existing tower sites and the related rental revenue generated in a particular period. 29 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2006 2005 (In thousands) REVENUES: Rental and management $ 1,294,068 $ 929,762 $ 364,306 39 % Network development services 23,317 15,024 8,293 55 Total revenues 1,317,385 944,786 372,599 39 OPERATING EXPENSES: Costs of operations (exclusive of items shown separately below) Rental and management 332,246 247,781 84,465 34 Network development services 11,291 8,346 2,945 35 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 528,051 411,254 116,797 28 Selling, general, administrative and development expense (including $39,502 and $6,597 of stock-based compensation expense, respectively) 159,324 108,059 51,265 47 Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense (including $9,333 of stock-based compensation expense in 2005) 2,572 34,232 (31,660 ) (92 ) Total operating expenses 1,033,484 809,672 223,812 28 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest income, TV Azteca, net of interest expense $1,491 and $1,492 14,208 14,232 (24 ) (0 ) Interest income 9,002 4,402 4,600 104 Interest expense (215,643 ) (222,419 ) (6,776 ) (3 ) Loss on retirement of long-term obligations (27,223 ) (67,110 ) (39,887 ) (59 ) Other income 6,619 227 6,392 2,816 Income tax provision (41,768 ) (5,714 ) 36,054 631 Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries (784 ) (575 ) 209 36 Income (loss) on equity method investments 26 (2,078 ) 2,104 101 Loss from discontinued operations, net (854 ) (1,913 ) (1,059 ) (55 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net (35,525 ) (35,525 ) N/A Net income (loss) $ 27,484 $ (181,359 ) $ 208,843 115 % Total Revenues Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $1,317.4 million, an increase of $372.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. Approximately $274.6 million of the increase was attributable to revenues generated by SpectraSite. The balance of the increase resulted from an increase in other rental and management revenue of $90.1 and an increase in other network development services revenue of $7.9 million. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $1,294.1 million, an increase of $364.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. Approximately $274.2 million of the increase was 30 Table of Contents attributable to revenues generated by SpectraSite. Approximately $79.1 million of the increase resulted from incremental revenue generated by communications sites that existed during the entire period between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006, which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites, the effects of straight-line accounting treatment of contractual escalators in our tenant leases and favorable currency exchange rates, offset by lease cancellations. Approximately $11.0 million of the increase resulted from revenue generated by the approximately 614 communications sites acquired and/or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2005, other than in connection with the SpectraSite merger. We believe that our rental and management revenue will increase as we continue to utilize existing site capacity. We anticipate that the majority of our new leasing activity will continue to come from wireless and broadcast service providers. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $23.3 million, an increase of $8.3 million from year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to revenues generated by our structural analysis services due to the increased business associated with our significantly larger communications site portfolio, primarily as a result of sites acquired from SpectraSite. As we continue to focus on and grow our site leasing business, we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $1,033.5 million, an increase of $223.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was attributable to an increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense of $116.8 million, an increase in expenses within our rental and management segment of $84.5 million, an increase in selling, general, administrative and development expense of $51.3 million and an increase in expenses within our network development services segment of $2.9 million. These increases were offset by a decrease in impairments, net loss of sale on long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense of $31.7 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Gross Margin/Segment Operating Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $332.2 million, an increase of $84.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. Approximately $78.8 million of the increase was attributable to expenses incurred by SpectraSite. Approximately $2.8 million of the increase was related to approximately 614 sites acquired and/or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2005, other than sites acquired from SpectraSite. The remaining $2.9 million of the increase was attributable to communications sites which existed during the period between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006, primarily related to increases in ground rent expense. Rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $976.0 million, an increase of $279.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. Approximately $195.5 million of the increase resulted from communications sites acquired from SpectraSite. The balance of the increase resulted from the additional rental and management revenue, net of related expenses, described above. Rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $914.9 million, an increase of $277.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was comprised of the $279.8 million increase in rental and management segment gross margin described above, net of a $2.7 million increase in selling, general, administrative and development expenses related to the rental and management segment. Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $11.3 million, an increase of $2.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The majority of the increase correlates directly to the increase in services performed as noted above. 31 Table of Contents Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $528.1 million, an increase of $116.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. Approximately $116.2 million of the increase was attributable to depreciation, amortization and accretion expense related to long-lived assets acquired in connection with the SpectraSite merger. Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense Selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $159.3 million, an increase of $51.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $32.9 million in stock-based compensation expense and $16.2 million in costs associated with the review of our stock option granting practices and related legal and governmental proceedings, and other related costs. See “—Stock Option Review and Related Matters” below. The remaining net increase was primarily the result of the inclusion of SpectraSite expenses for the full year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the five months post-merger for the year ended December 31, 2005. Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long-lived Assets, Restructuring and Merger Related Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $2.6 million, a decrease of $31.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease was primarily due to a $16.1 million decrease in impairments and net loss on sale of long-lived assets, an $11.3 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense and related payroll taxes associated with restructuring and merger activities and a $3.1 million decrease in severance, retention and other employee expenses associated with the 2005 SpectraSite merger. The net decrease of $16.1 million in impairments and net loss on sale of long-lived assets was primarily comprised of a $9.2 million reduction in impairments related to towers with no current tenant leases and gains from asset sales totaling $5.1 million. The gains from asset sales included the sale of 27 towers in one transaction and sales of other non-core assets. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $215.6 million, a decrease of $6.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in interest expense of approximately $49.8 million as a result of redemptions and repurchases of outstanding debt securities, offset by additional interest incurred related to the SpectraSite credit facility and higher borrowing levels on the American Tower credit facility totaling approximately $45.3 million. Loss on Retirement of Long-Term Obligations During the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately $45.0 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes were converted into shares of our Class A common stock, and we repurchased approximately $74.9 million principal amount of ATI 7.25% Notes and $23.5 million principal amount of 5.0% Notes. In connection with these transactions, we paid the noteholders an aggregate of $104.0 million in cash, including accrued interest. In addition, on February 1, 2006, we redeemed $227.7 million aggregate principal amount ($162.1 million accreted value, net of $7.0 million fair value discount allocated to warrants) of ATI 12.25% Notes in accordance with the indenture at 106.125% of their accreted value for an aggregate of $179.5 million. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a charge of $27.2 million related to amounts paid in excess of the carrying value and the write-off of related deferred financing fees. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we redeemed $274.9 million principal amount of our 9 3/8% senior notes due 2009 (9 3/8% Notes), repurchased $177.8 million accreted value of our ATI 12.25% Notes and converted $57.1 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes. In addition, we refinanced the American Tower 32 Table of Contents and SpectraSite credit facilities. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a $67.1 million charge primarily related to the write-off of deferred financing fees and amounts paid in excess of the carrying value. For more information regarding our financing activities, see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Refinancing Activities and Repurchases of Debt” below. Other Income Other income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $6.6 million, an increase of $6.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to a $5.4 million gain realized during the quarter ended December 31, 2006 from the sale of 1.6 million shares of FiberTower Corporation, an investment we had previously accounted for under the cost method. We plan to sell all or a portion of our remaining holdings of 3.9 million shares of FiberTower during 2007. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2006 we have recorded these shares as available-for-sale securities within the current assets of our consolidated balance sheet, with an unrealized gain of $10.4 million, net of tax, recorded within other comprehensive income. Income Tax Provision The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $41.8 million, as compared to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, representing an increase of $36.1 million from the prior year period. The effective tax rate was 58.9% for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The provision for the year ended December 31, 2005 reflects a $29.5 million charge as a result of a reduction in management’s estimate of the net realizable value of our federal income tax refund claims based upon the current status of the claims, as described below. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to foreign items, IRS audit adjustments and state taxes. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to our refund claims as more fully described below, foreign items, IRS audit adjustments and state taxes. We intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset through our federal income tax refund claims related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses. In June 2003 and October 2003, we filed federal income tax refund claims with the IRS relating to the carry back of $380.0 million of net operating losses generated prior to 2003, of which we initially anticipated receiving approximately $90.0 million. Based on preliminary discussions with tax authorities, we revised our estimate of the net realizable value of our federal income tax refund claims during the year ended December 31, 2005, and anticipate receiving a refund of approximately $65.0 million, plus interest. We expect settlement of this matter in the first half of 2007, however, there can be no assurances with respect to the timing of any refund. Because of the uncertainty associated with the claim, we have not recognized any amounts related to interest. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net Loss from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $0.8 million, as compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The loss from discontinued operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 primarily represents the legal costs incurred in connection with our involvement in the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings. We also expect to incur additional costs in connection with these proceedings. 33 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2005 2004 (In thousands) REVENUES: Rental and management $ 929,762 $ 684,422 $ 245,340 36 % Network development services 15,024 22,238 (7,214 ) (32 ) Total revenues 944,786 706,660 238,126 34 OPERATING EXPENSES: Costs of operations (exclusive of items shown separately below) Rental and management 247,781 195,242 52,539 27 Network development services 8,346 16,220 (7,874 ) (49 ) Depreciation, amortization and accretion 411,254 329,449 81,805 25 Selling, general, administrative and development expense (including $6,597 and $9,874 of stock-based compensation expense, respectively) 108,059 83,094 24,965 30 Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense (including $9,333 and $876 of stock-based compensation expense, respectively) 34,232 23,876 10,356 43 Total operating expenses 809,672 647,881 161,791 25 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest income, TV Azteca, net of interest expense $1,492 and $1,497 14,232 14,316 (84 ) (1 ) Interest income 4,402 4,844 (442 ) (9 ) Interest expense (222,419 ) (262,237 ) (39,818 ) (15 ) Loss on retirement of long-term obligations (67,110 ) (138,016 ) (70,906 ) (51 ) Other income (expense) 227 (2,798 ) (3,025 ) (108 ) Income tax (provision) benefit (5,714 ) 83,338 (89,052 ) (107 ) Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries (575 ) (2,366 ) (1,791 ) (76 ) Loss on equity method investments (2,078 ) (2,915 ) (837 ) (29 ) Loss from discontinued operations, net (1,913 ) (8,409 ) (6,496 ) (77 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net (35,525 ) 35,525 N/A Net loss $ (181,359 ) $ (255,464 ) $ (74,105 ) (29 )% Total Revenues Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $944.8 million, an increase of $238.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. Approximately $171.2 million of the increase was attributable to revenues generated by SpectraSite. The balance of the increase resulted from an increase in other rental and management revenue of $74.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in network development services revenue of $7.2 million. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $929.8 million, an increase of $245.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. Approximately $171.2 million of the increase was attributable to revenues generated by SpectraSite. Approximately $63.3 million of the increase resulted from 34 Table of Contents incremental revenue generated by communications sites that existed during the entire period between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005, which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites, contractual escalators net of straight-line accounting treatment and favorable currency exchange rates, offset by lease cancellations. Approximately $10.8 million of the increase resulted from revenue generated by the approximately 560 communications sites acquired and/or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2004, other than in connection with the SpectraSite merger. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $15.0 million, a decrease of $7.2 million from year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in revenue was attributable to a decline in revenues generated by our site acquisition, zoning and permitting services, primarily as a result of our strategic focus on our core site leasing business. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenues generated by our structural analysis services, as a result of the increased business associated with our significantly larger site portfolio following our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $809.7 million, an increase of $161.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to an increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense of $81.8 million, an increase in expenses within our rental and management segment of $52.5 million, an increase in selling, general, administrative and development expense of $25.0 million, and an increase in impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense of $10.4 million. These increases were offset by a decrease in expenses within our network development services segment of $7.9 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Operating Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $247.8 million, an increase of $52.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. Approximately $53.1 million of the increase was attributable to expenses incurred by SpectraSite. Excluding the impact of expenses incurred by SpectraSite, rental and management expense did not change materially as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $696.2 million, an increase of $192.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. Approximately $118.1 million of the increase was attributable to rental and management segment operating profit generated by SpectraSite. The balance of the increase resulted primarily from additional revenue from adding tenants to communications sites that existed as of January 1, 2004 and revenue generated on the approximately 560 communications sites acquired and/or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2004 other than in connection with the SpectraSite merger, and the impact of favorable currency exchange rates. Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $8.4 million, a decrease of $7.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. The majority of the decrease correlates directly to the decline in services performed as noted above. Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $411.3 million, an increase of $81.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to approximately $78.0 million of depreciation, amortization and accretion expense related to long-lived assets acquired in connection with the SpectraSite merger and approximately $3.8 million related to other newly acquired or constructed towers and other long-lived assets. 35 Table of Contents Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense Selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $108.1 million, an increase of $25.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. Approximately $18.6 million of the increase was attributable to general and administrative expense incurred by SpectraSite. The balance of the increase was primarily attributable to employee bonuses, including amounts paid in connection with the closing of the SpectraSite merger, offset by a decrease of $3.3 million in stock-based compensation expense, which aggregated $6.6 million and $9.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long-lived Assets, Restructuring and Merger Related Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $34.2 million, an increase of $10.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was due primarily to merger related expense of $9.0 million incurred in connection with the SpectraSite merger, including employee separation costs of $3.1 million, amortization of unearned compensation relating to unvested stock options assumed of $2.4 million and other employee stock option charges of $3.5 million. Restructuring expense and stock-based compensation expense also increased by $4.6 million related to modified option awards, which was partially offset by a decline of $3.2 million in impairments and net losses on sales of long-lived non-core assets. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $222.4 million, a decrease of $39.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease resulted primarily as a result of the redemption of all of our outstanding 9 3/8% Notes, repurchases of our ATI 12.25% Notes, conversions of our 3.25% Notes and the refinancing of the American Tower credit facility at lower interest rates. This decrease was partially offset by a full year of interest payable on our 7.50% Notes, 3.00% convertible notes due August 15, 2012 (3.00% Notes) and 7.125% Notes issued in February, August and September of 2004, respectively, and approximately $15.2 million of interest expense incurred on the debt assumed in the SpectraSite merger. Loss on Retirement of Long-Term Obligations During the year ended December 31, 2005, we redeemed $274.9 million principal amount of our 9 3/8% Notes, repurchased $177.8 million accreted value of our ATI 12.25% Notes and converted $57.1 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes. In addition, we refinanced the American Tower and SpectraSite credit facilities. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a $67.1 million charge primarily related to the write-off of deferred financing fees and amounts paid in excess of the carrying value. For more information regarding our financing activities, see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Refinancing Activities and Repurchases of Debt” below. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we redeemed all of our outstanding 6.25% convertible notes, redeemed and repurchased portions of our outstanding 9 3/8% Notes, ATI 12.25% Notes and 5.0% Notes, and refinanced of our credit facility. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a $138.0 million charge related to the write-off of deferred financing fees and amounts paid in excess of the carrying value. Other Income Other income for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $0.2 million, a decrease of $3.0 million from other expense of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease was primarily attributable to approximately $2.9 million of other income generated on interest rate swap agreements assumed in the SpectraSite merger. Income Tax (Provision) Benefit The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $5.7 million, as compared to an $83.3 million tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2004, representing a decrease of $89.1 million from 36 Table of Contents the prior year period. The effective tax rate was 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to 25.6% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The provision for the year ended December 31, 2005 reflects a $29.5 million charge as a result of a reduction in management’s estimate of the net realizable value of our federal income tax refund claims based upon the current status of the claims, as described below. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to our refund claims and foreign items. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to valuation allowances related to capital losses and foreign items. Minority Interest in Net Earnings of Subsidiaries Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $0.6 million, a decrease of $1.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease is primarily a result of the Company’s purchase during 2004 of the remaining 12.0% interest in ATC Mexico that it did not own. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net Loss from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $1.9 million, as compared to $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily represents the legal costs incurred in connection with our involvement in the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings. The loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes $7.8 million related to the results of operations through the date of sale of our tower construction services unit and Kline, as well as a net loss on disposal of our tower construction services unit of $1.7 million and a $1.1 million net gain related to a contractual obligation that was settled for less than its original estimate. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle, Net As of December 31, 2005, we adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47 “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations” (FIN No. 47). As a result, we recognized a $35.5 million charge (net of an $11.7 million tax benefit) as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. The adoption of FIN No. 47 primarily resulted in the acceleration of settlement date assumptions regarding our asset retirement obligations, as FIN No. 47 precludes us from considering non contractual lease renewal periods in determining our settlement date assumptions. The acceleration of our settlement date assumptions also resulted in an increase to the tower assets included in property and equipment, net of $66.9 million and an increase in the asset retirement obligations included in other long-term obligations of $114.0 million. Stock Option Review and Related Matters During the year ended December 31, 2006, we conducted a review of our stock option granting practices and related accounting. In May 2006, we reported that our Board of Directors had established a special committee of independent directors to conduct a review of our stock option granting practices and related accounting with the assistance of independent legal counsel and forensic auditors. In November 2006, the special committee reported to the Board of Directors regarding its findings, including that, for certain stock option grants, the legal grant dates when all necessary corporate action had been taken differed from the dates previously recorded for financial accounting and tax purposes. As a result of the special committee’s findings, we restated our historical financial statements to, among other things, record charges for stock-based compensation expense related to certain option grants and to account for the tax-related consequences. In November 2006, we filed an Amendment No. 1 to our annual report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2005, an 37 Table of Contents Amendment No. 1 to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q/A for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006 to reflect the impact of the restatement on our historical financial statements. In addition, in February 2007, in response to additional SEC guidance, we filed an Amendment No. 2 to our annual report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2005. In connection with its review of our stock option granting practices, the special committee recommended a remediation plan to the Board of Directors to address the issues raised by its findings. In December 2006, we reported that the Board of Directors approved the remediation plan, which included, among other things, the elimination of any excess benefit received by our current officers and members of the Board of Directors from options having been granted to them with exercise prices below the fair market value of our Class A common stock on the legal grant date, as determined by the special committee. For outstanding options, this was accomplished by amending each option to increase the exercise price to the fair market value on the legal grant date, without any compensation to the optionholder. In December 2006, eight of our senior officers and Directors amended the exercise prices of options to purchase an aggregate of 985,511 shares, thereby eliminating an aggregate excess benefit of approximately $6.5 million. For options that had been exercised, this was accomplished by compensating the Company for the amount of the excess benefit received upon exercise, after reduction for any taxes paid by the individual. In January 2007, five of the Company’s senior officers surrendered vested in-the-money options to purchase an aggregate of 23,269 shares, thereby surrendering an aggregate excess benefit of approximately $0.6 million (net of approximately $0.4 million in taxes paid by such individuals). In addition, we took similar steps to eliminate any excess benefit received by certain former officers from the grant to them of options with exercise prices below fair market value. In December 2006 and January 2007, two former officers amended the exercise prices of options to purchase an aggregate of 423,333 shares, thereby eliminating an aggregate excess benefit of approximately $1.0 million, and surrendered vested in-the-money options to purchase an aggregate of 3,028 shares, thereby surrendering an aggregate excess benefit of approximately $0.1 million (net of taxes paid by such individuals). As a result of the review of our stock option granting practices, we determined that a number of stock options were granted with exercise prices below the quoted market price of our Class A common stock on the date of grant. Under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 409A), part of recently enacted tax legislation, options that were granted with exercise prices below the quoted market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant and that vest after December 31, 2004 will likely be subject to unfavorable tax consequences that did not apply at the time of grant. In order to compensate our non-executive employees who previously exercised affected options and already incurred taxes and penalties under Section 409A, we made cash payments on behalf of such individuals for these taxes in January 2007 for an aggregate of approximately $0.8 million. In order to remedy the unfavorable personal tax consequences of Section 409A on holders of outstanding options, we conducted a tender offer in December 2006 for the affected options, pursuant to which we offered to amend the affected options to increase the option exercise price to the quoted market price on the revised grant date, and to give the option holders (excluding officers and Directors) a cash payment for the difference in option exercise price between the amended option and the original price. Following completion of the tender offer, in January 2007, we paid an aggregate of approximately $3.9 million in cash to holders of options that were amended in the tender offer. As discussed above in Item 3 of this annual report under the caption “Legal Proceedings,” we have received a letter of informal inquiry from the SEC, a subpoena from the office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York and an information document request from the IRS, each requesting documents and information related to our stock option granting practices. In addition, we and certain of our current and former officers and directors are defendants in lawsuits related to our stock option granting practices. In connection with the review of our stock option granting practices, the restatement of our historical financial statements and the related legal and governmental proceedings, we have incurred significant legal, accounting and auditing expenses, and we expect that significant legal expenditures will continue to be incurred in the future. 38 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we improved our financial position by refinancing and repurchasing a portion of our outstanding indebtedness, which increased our flexibility and our ability to return value to our stockholders. Our significant 2006 transactions included the following: • The redemption, conversion or repurchase of approximately $371.1 million face amount of our outstanding debt securities using cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facilities and with respect to conversions of convertible notes, shares of our Class A common stock. • The repurchase of approximately 10.1 million shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate of $321.8 million under our stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2006, we had repurchased approximately 12.9 million shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate of $398.4 million under this program. As of December 31, 2006, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $3.5 billion. Prior to 2002, we incurred indebtedness to fund the acquisition of tower sites and construction of new tower sites, and to fund acquisitions of businesses related to our services and satellite segments. Beginning in 2002, we significantly reduced our acquisitions and new tower construction activities, and began to focus on reducing our overall indebtedness. Since then, we have sold businesses and assets that did not provide incremental value to our site leasing business, and we have taken steps to refinance our indebtedness, extend maturity dates, lower our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility. In addition, since 2004, we have used cash flow from operations to redeem and repurchase outstanding debt. In 2006, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and cash interest obligations. We believe our cash generated by operations for the year ending December 31, 2007 also will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and our cash debt service (interest and principal repayments) obligations for 2007. For information about our outstanding indebtedness, see “—Contractual Obligations” below. Our debt service obligations as of December 31, 2006 are set forth under “—Uses of Cash—Contractual Obligations” below, which reflects an aggregate of $446.2 million of cash payments to be made in 2007. This amount includes $252.2 million related to the repurchase obligations for our 5.0% Notes, due to the noteholders’ rights to require us to purchase their notes on February 20, 2007. In February 2007, we conducted a tender offer for our outstanding 5.0% Notes, pursuant to which we repurchased an aggregate of $192.5 principal amount of notes for an aggregate of $192.6 million. Upon completion of this tender offer, $59.7 million principal amount of our 5.0% Notes remained outstanding. Accordingly, giving effect to the completion of the tender offer, our remaining debt service obligations for 2007 aggregate $194.0 million. In 2007, we expect to fund capital expenditures of between $130.0 and $150.0 million, principally related to new tower construction, improvements to existing towers and installation of new in-building systems. In addition, we expect to continue to fund our current $750 million stock repurchase program, which is expected to be completed by the end of February 2007, as well as our new stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we intend to purchase up to an additional $1.5 billion of our Class A common stock through February 2008. We also may fund additional purchases of our Class A common stock, either pursuant to, or supplemental to, our stock repurchase program. We expect to meet these cash needs through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations, borrowings under our credit facilities and future financing transactions. During 2007, we expect that we will raise additional capital to fund stock repurchases, repurchase existing debt and for other general corporate purposes. As set forth below under “—Sources of Cash—Credit Facilities,” in February 2007, we secured an additional $550.0 million of revolving loan commitments under our credit facilities. During the first half of 2007, we also anticipate raising additional capital through a securitization of the majority of the towers in our SpectraSite portfolio. 39 Table of Contents Uses of Cash Stock Repurchase Program. In November 2005, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $750.0 million of our Class A common stock through December 2006. On May 23, 2006, we announced that we were temporarily suspending repurchases under the stock repurchase program in light of the uncertainty surrounding the pending review of our stock option granting practices and the related governmental proceedings. On December 20, 2006, we announced that we were resuming repurchases of our Class A common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased 10.1 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate of $321.8 million. As of December 31, 2006, we had repurchased an aggregate of 12.9 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate of $398.4 million pursuant to our stock repurchase program. Between January 1, 2007 and February 20, 2007, we repurchased an additional 7.2 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate of $287.1 million pursuant to our stock repurchase program. In February 2007, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program pursuant to which we intend to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our Class A common stock through February 2008. We expect to utilize cash on hand, cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, and borrowings from potential future financings to fund the repurchase program. Under the program, our management is authorized to purchase shares from time to time in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. To facilitate repurchases, we plan to make purchases pursuant to a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. Tower Maintenance and Improvements, Tower Construction and In-Building System Installation, and Tower and Land Acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2006, payments for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities totaled $127.1 million, including $60.5 million of capital expenditures related to the maintenance, improvement and augmentation of our existing communication sites, $44.9 million spent in connection with the construction of 213 towers and the installation of 22 in-building systems, $12.3 million spent to acquire land under our towers that was subject to ground leases, and $9.4 million spent on non-site specific capital expenditures. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we spent $14.3 million to acquire 84 towers and 6 in-building systems. We plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet our return criteria. Accordingly, we may continue to acquire communications sites, acquire land under our towers, build or install new communications sites and redevelop or improve existing communications sites when the expected returns on such investments meet our investment criteria. We anticipate that in 2007 we will build approximately 200 new towers and install approximately 25 new in-building systems. We expect that our 2007 capital expenditures will be between approximately $130.0 million and $150.0 million, including approximately $30.0 million for land purchases. Refinancing and Repurchases of Debt. In order to extend the maturity dates of our indebtedness, lower our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility, we use our available liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we redeemed, converted or repurchased approximately $371.1 million face amount of our outstanding debt securities using cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facilities and with respect to conversions of convertible notes, shares of our Class A common stock. These refinancing and repurchase activities included the redemption of $227.7 million face amount ($162.1 million accreted value, net of $7.0 million fair value allocated to warrants) of the ATI 12.25% Notes, the conversion of $45.0 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes, the repurchase of $23.5 million principal amount of our 5.0% Notes and the repurchase of $74.9 million principal amount of the ATI 7.25% Notes. In February 2007, we conducted a cash tender offer for our outstanding 5.0% Notes, pursuant to which we repurchased an aggregate of $192.5 million principal amount of notes for an aggregate of $192.6 million. For more information about our financing activities, see “—Refinancing Activities and Repurchases of Debt” below. ATC South America. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we used cash from operations to fund the repurchase of the remaining 9.3% minority interest in ATC South America not owned by us. In April 2006, we 40 Table of Contents paid a total of $22.9 million in connection with the repurchase of these interests from stockholders of ATC South America, including J. Michael Gearon, Jr. and William H. Hess, executive officers of the Company. Giving effect to these repurchases, we now own 100% of ATC South America (see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report). Expenses Related to Stock Option Review and Related Matters. In connection with the review of our stock option granting practices, the restatement of our historical financial statements and the related legal and governmental proceedings, we have incurred significant legal, accounting and auditing expenses, and we expect that significant legal expenditures will continue to be incurred in the future. For more information regarding the review of our stock option granting practices and the related proceedings, please see “—Stock Option Review and Related Matters” above and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we incurred approximately $16.2 million in costs associated with the review of our stock option granting practices, the related legal and governmental proceedings, and other related costs. In addition, depending on the outcomes of these proceedings, we could be subject to regulatory fines, penalties or other liability. We also incurred costs associated with the tender offer for stock options that were determined to have been granted with exercise prices below the quoted market price of our Class A common stock on the date of grant. As discussed above in “—Stock Option Review and Related Matters”, we conducted a tender offer in December 2006 and in January 2007, we paid an aggregate of approximately $3.9 million in cash to holders of options that were amended in the tender offer. Contractual Obligations. Our contractual obligations relate primarily to borrowings under the credit facilities and our outstanding notes. The following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations payable in cash as of December 31, 2006 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total American Tower credit facility(1) Revolving credit facility Term Loan A $ 750,000 $ 750,000 Delayed Draw Term Loan 250,000 250,000 SpectraSite credit facility(1) Revolving credit facility Term Loan A 700,000 700,000 Delayed Draw Term Loan 25,000 25,000 7.25% senior subordinated notes $ 325,075 325,075 7.50% senior notes $ 225,000 225,000 7.125% senior notes 500,000 500,000 5.0% convertible notes(2) $ 252,188 252,188 3.25% convertible notes 107,869 107,869 3.00% convertible notes 344,999 344,999 2.25% convertible notes 40 40 Long-term obligations, excluding capital leases and other notes payable $ 252,228 $ 1,832,869 $ 325,075 $ 1,069,999 $ 3,480,171 Cash interest expense(1) 189,000 187,000 187,000 172,000 85,000 41,000 861,000 Capital lease payments (including interest) and other notes payable 4,965 4,507 3,880 3,788 16,802 195,880 229,822 Total debt service obligations $ 446,193 $ 191,507 $ 190,880 $ 2,008,657 $ 426,877 $ 1,306,879 $ 4,570,993 Operating lease payments(3) 208,257 202,212 199,286 192,487 184,406 2,529,484 3,516,132 Other long-term liabilities(4) 155 1,852 167 176 253 178,254 180,857 Total $ 654,605 $ 395,571 $ 390,333 $ 2,201,320 $ 611,536 $ 4,014,617 $ 8,267,982 41 Table of Contents (1) For more information regarding the American Tower and SpectraSite credit facilities, see “—Sources of Cash” below. Interest rates for the revolving loan and the term loan components of each of the credit facilities are determined at the option of the borrowers under the facility and range between 0.50% and 1.25% above the applicable London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.0% and 0.25% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on the applicable borrowers’ debt ratings. A quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of each credit facility is required, ranging from 0.10% to 0.375% per annum, based on the applicable borrowers’ debt ratings. As discussed in Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” we have entered into swap agreements to manage exposure to variable rate interest obligations under the credit facilities. As a result of these swap agreements, the effective weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2006 for the credit facilities was 5.30%. For projections of our cash interest expense related to the credit facilities, we have assumed the LIBOR rate before the margin, as defined in our credit facilities agreements, is 5.37% through their maturity on October 27, 2010. (2) The holders of our 5.0% convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on specified dates prior to their maturity date in 2010, but we may pay the purchase price by issuing shares of our Class A common stock, subject to certain conditions. The obligation with respect to the right of the holders to put the 5.0% convertible notes on February 20, 2007, has been classified as a cash obligation for 2007. In February 2007, we conducted a cash tender offer for our outstanding 5.0% Notes, pursuant to which we repurchased $192.5 million principal amount of notes for an aggregate of $192.6 million. (3) Operating lease payments include payments to be made under non-cancelable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable tower site and related revenues from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that we will renew the lease. (4) Primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other long-term liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily our straight-line rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash. The above table does not include certain commitments relating to the construction of tower sites under existing build to suit agreements as of December 31, 2006, as we cannot currently estimate the timing and amounts of such payments. (See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included herein.) Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Sources of Cash American Tower Corporation is a holding company, and our cash flows are derived primarily from distributions from our operating subsidiaries. Our principal United States operating subsidiaries are ATI and SpectraSite. Our principal international operating subsidiary is American Tower International, Inc. Under the American Tower credit facility and the indentures for our senior notes and the ATI notes, ATI and American Tower International are subject to restrictions on the amount of cash that they can distribute to us. SpectraSite is subject to restrictions on the amount of cash that it can distribute to us under the SpectraSite credit facility, but as a result of its designation as an unrestricted subsidiary, it is not subject to such restrictions under the indentures for our senior notes and the ATI notes. Total Liquidity at December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $808.9 million of total liquidity, comprised of approximately $281.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to borrow approximately $282.2 million under the American Tower credit facility and approximately $245.4 million under the SpectraSite credit facility. In February 2007, we entered into two incremental revolving loan commitments under our credit facilities, consisting of a $300.0 million revolving loan under the American Tower credit facility and a $250.0 million revolving loan under the SpectraSite credit facility, both of which remained undrawn at closing. In addition, in February 2007, we drew down $250.0 million of the existing revolving loans under the American Tower credit facility to fund the cash tender offer for our 5.0% Notes. As of February 22, 2007, our available liquidity under the American Tower credit facility was approximately $331.9 million and our available liquidity under the SpectraSite credit facility was approximately $495.4 million. 42 Table of Contents Cash Generated by Operations. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, our cash provided by operating activities was $620.7 million, $397.2 million and $216.7 million, respectively. Our rental and management and network development services segments are expected to generate cash flows from operations during 2007 in excess of their cash needs for operations and expenditures for tower construction, improvements and acquisitions. (See “—Results of Operations” above.) We expect to use the excess cash generated by operations principally to service our debt and to fund capital expenditures and repurchases of our Class A common stock. Credit Facilities. In October 2005, we refinanced the two existing credit facilities of our principal operating subsidiaries. We replaced the existing American Tower $1.1 billion senior secured credit facility with a new $1.3 billion senior secured credit facility and replaced the existing SpectraSite $900.0 million senior secured credit facility with a new $1.15 billion senior secured credit facility. For more information regarding our credit facilities, please see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we drew down $207.0 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loan component of the American Tower credit facility to finance debt redemptions and repurchases. As of December 31, 2006, the American Tower credit facility consists of a $300.0 million revolving credit facility (against which approximately $17.8 million of undrawn letters of credit are outstanding at December 31, 2006), maturing on October 27, 2010; a $750.0 million Term Loan A, which is fully drawn, maturing on October 27, 2010; and a $250.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan, which is fully drawn, maturing on October 27, 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we drew down $25.0 million of the Delayed Draw Term Loan component of the SpectraSite credit facility to finance debt redemptions and repurchases. In addition, on October 27, 2006, the remaining $175.0 million undrawn portion of the Delayed Draw Term Loan component of the SpectraSite credit facility was canceled pursuant to its terms. As of December 31, 2006, the SpectraSite credit facility consists of a $250.0 million revolving credit facility (against which approximately $4.6 million of undrawn letters of credit were outstanding at December 31, 2006), maturing on October 27, 2010; a $700.0 million Term Loan A, which is fully drawn, maturing on October 27, 2010; and a $25.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan, which is fully drawn. In February 2007, we entered into two incremental revolving loan commitments under our credit facilities, consisting of a $300.0 million revolving loan under the American Tower credit facility and a $250.0 million revolving loan under the SpectraSite credit facility. These revolving loans have terms that are consistent with those of the American Tower credit facility and the SpectraSite credit facility, and they mature on October 27, 2010. All amounts will be due and payable in full at maturity. The credit facilities and the new revolving loans do not require amortization of payments and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at the borrowers’ option without penalty or premium. The borrowers under the American Tower credit facility include American Tower L.P., ATI, American Tower International and American Tower LLC. We and the borrowers’ restricted subsidiaries (as defined in the loan agreement) have guaranteed all of the loans under the credit facility. These loans are secured by liens on and security interests in substantially all assets of the borrowers and the restricted subsidiaries. Following the closing of the new incremental revolving loan commitments, the American Tower credit facility consists of a $300.0 million revolving credit facility, a $300.0 million incremental revolving credit facility, a $750.0 million Term Loan A and a $250.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan. The borrower under the SpectraSite credit facility is SpectraSite Communications. SpectraSite Communications, its parent company (SpectraSite LLC), and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined in the loan agreement) have guaranteed all of the loans under the credit facility. These loans are secured by liens on and security interests in substantially all assets of the borrower and the restricted subsidiaries. Following the closing of the new incremental revolving loan commitments, the SpectraSite credit facility consists of a $250.0 million revolving credit facility, a $250.0 incremental revolving credit facility, a $700.0 million Term Loan A and a $25.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan. 43 Table of Contents Proceeds from the Sale of Equity Securities. We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our stock option and stock purchase plans and upon exercise of warrants to purchase our equity securities. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we received approximately $0.3 million in proceeds from exercises of warrants to purchase shares of our Class A common stock and an aggregate of approximately $40.6 million in proceeds from exercises of options to purchase shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to our stock option plans and sales of shares pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan. Proceeds from the Sale of Assets. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we received $35.4 million in aggregate net proceeds related to sales of non-core assets, including $30.5 million from sales of tower assets and buildings and $4.9 million from sales of investments. Refinancing Activities and Repurchases of Debt 3.25% Convertible Notes Conversions. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we issued an aggregate of 3,684,794 shares of Class A common stock upon conversion of approximately $45.0 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture, the holders of the 3.25% Notes are entitled to receive 81.808 shares of Class A common stock for every $1,000 principal amount of notes converted. In connection with the conversion, we paid such holders an aggregate of approximately $3.3 million, calculated based on the accrued and unpaid interest on the notes as of the date of conversion and the discounted value of the future interest payments on the notes. As of December 31, 2006, $107.9 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes remained outstanding. In February 2007, holders of an additional $44.4 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes converted their notes. In connection with these conversions, we issued an aggregate of 3,635,220 shares of Class A common stock and we paid such holders an aggregate of approximately $2.0 million. 5.0% Convertible Notes Repurchases. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased in privately negotiated transactions $23.5 million of 5.0% Notes for $23.4 million in cash. As of December 31, 2006, $252.2 million principal amount of 5.0% Notes remained outstanding. In February 2007, we conducted a cash tender offer for our outstanding 5.0% Notes. Pursuant to the tender offer we repurchased an aggregate of $192.5 million principal amount of notes for an aggregate of $192.6 million. Upon completion of this tender offer, $59.7 million principal amount of our 5.0% Notes remained outstanding. ATI 7.25% Notes Repurchases. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased in privately negotiated transactions $74.9 million principal amount of ATI 7.25% Notes for $77.3 million in cash. As of December 31, 2006, $325.1 million principal amount of ATI 7.25% Notes remained outstanding. ATI 12.25% Notes Redemption. In December 2005, we issued a notice for the redemption on February 1, 2006 of all outstanding ATI 12.25% Notes. On February 1, 2006, we redeemed $227.7 million face amount ($162.1 million accreted value, net of $7.0 million fair value allocated to warrants) of ATI 12.25% Notes in accordance with the indenture at 106.125% of their accreted value for an aggregate of $179.5 million. We used $0.5 million in cash on hand and $179.0 million in borrowings under the Delayed Draw Term Loan component of the American Tower credit facility to fund the redemption. Upon completion of this redemption, no ATI 12.25% Notes remained outstanding. Interest Rate Swap Agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we entered into four interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to variability in cash flows relating to forecasted interest payments in connection with the likely issuance of new fixed rate debt, which we expect to be issued on or before July 31, 2007. The swaps have an aggregate notional amount of $900.0 million and fixed rates ranging from 4.73% to 5.10%, and will be terminated upon issuance of new fixed rate debt. We have designated these forward starting interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges. We are exposed to market risk for decreases in interest rates until termination of the swap and if we fail to issue such new fixed rate debt on or before such date. As of December 31, 2006, we expect to receive the fair value of these swap agreements of approximately $3.8 million. As of December 31, 2006, we would be required to pay approximately $19.1 million in cash upon settlement of 44 Table of Contents the swaps if a decline of 10%, or approximately 50 basis points, in interest rates were to occur from the fixed rate of the swaps between the issuance date and the settlement date of the swaps. In February 2007, we also entered into two similar forward starting interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $200.0 million and a weighted average fixed rate of 5.06%. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Internally Generated Funds. Because the majority of our tenant leases are multi-year contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of 2006 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it to operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for antenna space on wireless and broadcast communications towers and for related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing towers. Restrictions Under Credit Facilities. The American Tower and SpectraSite credit facilities contain certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which the borrowers and their restricted subsidiaries must comply. Each credit facility contains the following two financial maintenance tests with which the borrowers under the applicable credit facility must comply: • a leverage ratio (Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than 5.50 to 1.00 for the borrowers and their restricted subsidiaries; and • an interest coverage ratio (Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense) of not less than 2.50 to 1.00 for the borrowers and their restricted subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with both of the foregoing financial tests. Any failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the American Tower credit facility or the SpectraSite credit facility would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving loans, but would constitute a default, resulting in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. The credit facilities allow us to use borrowings for general corporate purposes and, provided certain conditions are met, permit the use of borrowings under the credit facilities and internally generated funds to repurchase our equity securities and repurchase and refinance other indebtedness without additional lender approval. Restrictions Under Notes Indentures. The indenture governing the terms of the ATI 7.25% Notes contains certain covenants which further restrict ATI, the sister guarantors (as defined) and its and their subsidiaries in addition to the restrictions set forth in the American Tower credit facility. These include restrictions on their ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments. SpectraSite and its subsidiaries are unrestricted subsidiaries under the indenture for the ATI 7.25% Notes and are not subject to such restrictions. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default. Specifically, the indenture restricts ATI, the sister guarantors and its and their restricted subsidiaries from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock, other than debt under the American Tower credit facility, or renewals, refundings, replacements or refinancings, up to $1.6 billion. The indentures governing the terms of our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes also contain certain restrictive covenants with which we and the restricted subsidiaries under these indentures must comply. These include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments. SpectraSite and its subsidiaries are unrestricted subsidiaries under the indentures for our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes and are not subject to such restrictions. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default. Specifically, these indentures restrict us from incurring additional debt or 45 Table of Contents issuing certain types of preferred stock unless our consolidated debt is not greater than 7.5 times our adjusted consolidated cash flow. We are permitted, however, to incur debt under our credit facilities even if we are not in compliance with this ratio, or renewals, refundings, replacements or refinancings of our credit facilities. If a default occurred under any of our credit facilities or other debt securities, the maturity dates for our outstanding debt could be accelerated, and we likely would be prohibited from making additional borrowings under the credit facilities until we cured the default. If this were to occur, we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial ratios defined in the credit facilities agreements and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. As of December 31, 2006, our annual consolidated cash debt service obligations (principal and interest) for each of the next five years and thereafter are approximately: $446.2 million, $191.5 million, $190.9 million, $2.0 billion, $426.9 million and $1.3 billion, respectively. In addition, as a holding company, we depend on distributions or dividends from our subsidiaries, or funds raised through debt and equity offerings, to fund our debt obligations. Although the agreements governing the terms of our credit facilities and the indenture for the ATI 7.25% Notes permit our subsidiaries to make distributions to us to permit us to meet our debt service obligations, such terms also significantly limit their ability to distribute cash to us under certain circumstances. Accordingly, if we do not receive sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our debt, and there is no assurance we will succeed in such efforts. Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our debt obligations, and our ability to refinance such debt obligations, will depend on our future financial performance, which is subject to many factors beyond our control, as outlined above in Item 1A of this annual report under the caption “Risk Factors.” In addition, our ability to refinance any of our debt in the future may depend on our credit ratings from commercial rating agencies, which are dependent on our expected financial performance, the liquidity factors discussed above, and the rating agencies’ outlook for our industry. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete such refinancings or, if such refinancings are completed, that the terms will be commercially reasonable. Capital Markets. Our ability to raise additional funds in the capital markets depends on, among other things, general economic conditions, conditions of the wireless industry, our financial performance and the state of the capital markets. In April 2004, the SEC declared effective our “universal” shelf registration statement for possible future offerings of an aggregate of up to $1.0 billion of debt and/or equity securities. As of December 31, 2006, we had not conducted any offerings pursuant to this registration statement. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to income taxes, purchase price allocation, asset retirement obligations, stock-based compensation, impairment of assets and revenue recognition. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting 46 Table of Contents treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. For a discussion of our other accounting policies, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, beginning on page F-7. • Income Taxes. SFAS No. 109 “Accounting For Income Taxes,” requires that companies record a valuation allowance when it is “more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.” We record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. At December 31, 2006, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $308.2 million, including approximately $153.6 million attributable to SpectraSite, primarily related to certain net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards assumed as of the acquisition date. The balance of the valuation allowance primarily relates to net state deferred tax assets. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as we believe that we will have sufficient time to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty-year tax carryforward period. Valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets recoverability. Approximately $148.3 million of the SpectraSite valuation allowances as of December 31, 2006 will be recorded as a reduction to goodwill if the underlying deferred tax assets are utilized. We intend to recover a portion of our deferred tax asset through our federal income tax refund claims related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses. In June 2003 and October 2003, we filed federal income tax refund claims with the IRS relating to the carry back of $380.0 million of net operating losses generated prior to 2003, of which we initially anticipated receiving approximately $90.0 million. Based on preliminary discussions with tax authorities, we revised our estimate of the net realizable value of our federal income tax refund claims during the year ended December 31, 2005, and anticipate receiving a refund of approximately $65.0 million, plus interest. We expect settlement of this matter in the first half of 2007, however, there can be no assurances with respect to the timing of any refund. Because of the uncertainty associated with the claim, we have not recognized any amounts related to interest. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing stable state (no growth) projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $1.4 billion in taxable income from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2026. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described above, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense. From time to time, we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations, and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded a $29.5 million income tax provision to reflect a reduction in management’s estimate of the net realizable value of our pending federal tax refund claims as described above. We believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December 31, 2006. Depending on the resolution of the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings described in notes 9 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, we may be entitled to a worthless stock or bad debt deduction for our investment in Verestar. Prior to commencement of the 47 Table of Contents bankruptcy proceedings, we had advanced over $522.0 million to fund Verestar’s operations. No income tax benefit has been provided for these potential deductions due to the uncertainty surrounding the bankruptcy proceedings. • Purchase Price Allocation. We account for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141 “Business Combinations” (SFAS No. 141), which provides that purchase prices be allocated to the net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. In the case of tower assets acquired through the purchase of a business, such as our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition, and the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as residual goodwill. We completed our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. in August 2005 for a total preliminary purchase price of approximately $3.1 billion, including the fair value of shares of Class A common stock issued, the fair value of options and warrants assumed and estimated transaction costs. As of December 31, 2005 we were in the process of finalizing a third-party valuation of SpectraSite’s property and equipment, intangible assets and certain other assets and liabilities. Given the size of the SpectraSite transaction, the values of certain assets and liabilities were based on preliminary valuations that were subject to adjustment as additional information on management’s estimates and assumptions were obtained and the third-party valuation was finalized. We completed our third-party valuation and an analysis of the acquired tenant and ground leases in June 2006, which formed the basis for determining the cash flows used to value the customer intangible assets acquired and the estimated useful lives of the acquired assets. The final allocation of the purchase price resulted in changes to the fair values of certain assets and liabilities disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2005, as follows: a decrease of $80.0 million in total intangible assets, a decrease of $9.2 million in total tangible assets, a decrease of $33.3 million in the net deferred income tax liability, an increase of $1.4 million in other liabilities, and a corresponding increase of $54.5 million in goodwill. We accounted for the difference between the depreciation and amortization expense recorded in connection with the preliminary and final allocation of the purchase price as a change in accounting estimate under SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.” The impact of this change in estimate was accounted for prospectively and was not material to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006, nor will it be material to future periods. • Asset Retirement Obligations. We comply with the provisions of SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” (SFAS No. 143) and the provisions of FIN No. 47. Both pronouncements address the financial accounting and reporting requirements for conditional obligations associated with our legal obligation to retire tangible long-lived assets and the related asset retirement costs, principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of our tower assets are located. Under these accounting principles, we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made, and we accrete such liability through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. The associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets and depreciated over their estimated useful life. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we updated our assumptions used in estimating the Company’s aggregate asset retirement obligation which resulted in a net (decrease) increase in the estimated obligation of $(0.7) million and $2.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, we also adopted the provisions of FIN No. 47 and recognized a $35.5 million charge (net of an $11.7 million tax benefit) as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. This adoption also increased our aggregate asset retirement obligation by approximately $114.0 million to $162.4 million as of December 31, 2005 and resulted in an increase to tower assets included in property and equipment, net of $66.9 million. The adoption of FIN No. 47 primarily resulted in the acceleration of our settlement date assumptions, as FIN No. 47 precludes us from considering non contractual lease renewal periods in determining our 48 Table of Contents settlement date assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows, and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense. The significant assumptions used in estimating the Company’s aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary. • Stock-Based Compensation. On January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment,” (SFAS No. 123R), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options and employee stock purchases under employee stock purchase plans. SFAS No. 123R supersedes the Company’s previous accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (APB No. 25). Under SFAS No. 123R, we are no longer permitted to account for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB No. 25 described below. Instead, we are required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and recognize the related expense associated with share-based payments in the statement of operations. We adopted SFAS No. 123R under the modified prospective method, pursuant to which compensation expense for all share-based payments granted or modified after the effective date is recognized based upon the requirements of SFAS No. 123R. Accordingly, prior period amounts have not been restated related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R primarily resulted in a change in our method of measuring and recognizing the fair value of option awards and estimating forfeitures for all unvested awards. SFAS No. 123R requires companies to recognize stock-based compensation awards granted to employees as compensation expense on a fair value method. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service period, which generally represents the vesting period. The expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will be forfeited. Under SFAS No. 123R, the fair value of the stock option is determined using an Black-Scholes option-pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the accounting measurement date, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock and its expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. These assumptions are highly subjective and changes in them could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the pro forma compensation expense. Under SFAS No. 123R, the fair value of the stock option is determined in the same manner as the pro forma compensation cost under SFAS No. 123 described below and adjusted for estimated forfeitures. Under APB No. 25, the Company previously recorded the impact of forfeitures as they occurred. In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 123R-3, “Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards” (FAS 123R-3). Effective upon issuance, this FSP describes an alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool (APIC pool) related to the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and the statement of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of SFAS No.123R. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we elected the “Long” method, as defined in the FAS 123R-3. In addition, in accordance with SFAS No. 123R, SFAS No. 109 and EITF Topic D-32, “Intraperiod Tax Allocation of the Tax Effect of Pretax Income from Continuing Operations”, we have elected to recognize excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises in additional paid-in capital only if an incremental income tax benefit would be realized after considering all other tax attributes presently 49 Table of Contents available to us. We measure the tax benefit associated with excess tax deductions related to stock-based compensation expense by multiplying the excess tax deductions by the statutory tax rates. Prior to January 1, 2006, we measured compensation expense for our stock-based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB No. 25. Under the intrinsic value method, compensation expense associated with fixed awards is the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the stock at the accounting measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is measured as of the date an award has received approval by relevant authority, the number of shares and exercise price are fixed and allocation to specific individuals has occurred. Generally, this occurs on the date the grant is approved by the compensation committee of our Board of Directors, or, if grant authority has been delegated to management, when the shares are allocated to specific individuals. The stock-based compensation expense for an award is recognized over the vesting period using the ratable method, whereby an equal amount of expense is recognized for each year of vesting. The actual accounting measurement dates determined in the course of our recent review of our stock option granting practices are based on a review of supporting approval documentation and other extrinsic evidence of awards. While our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 have used the above measure, SFAS No. 123 also historically required that we present in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements pro forma financial results as if a fair value method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument were applied. Under SFAS No. 123, the fair value of the stock option is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the accounting measurement date, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock and its expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. These assumptions are highly subjective and changes in them could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the disclosure of pro forma compensation expense. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we re-evaluated the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options issued to employees and related disclosure of pro forma expense. As a result, we lowered our expected volatility assumption for options granted after July 1, 2005 to approximately 30% and increased the expected life of option grants to 6.25 years using the simplified method permitted by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 107, “Share-Based Payment” (SAB No. 107). We made this change based on a number of factors, including our execution of our strategic plans to sell non-core businesses, reduce leverage and our merger with SpectraSite. We had previously based our volatility assumptions on historical volatility since inception, which included periods when our capital structure was more highly leveraged than current levels and expected levels for the foreseeable future. Our estimate of future volatility is based on our consideration of all available information, including historical volatility, implied volatility of publicly traded options, our current capital structure and our publicly announced future business plans. • Impairment of Assets. Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization and Non-Core Long-Lived Assets Held for Sale: We review long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or our review of our tower portfolio indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Our tower portfolio review includes sites for which we have no current tenant leases. We assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows, or anticipated proceeds from sales of the assets. If we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset’s fair market value as compared to its carrying value. We record any related impairment losses in the period in which we identify such impairment. We also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based on management’s best estimate 50 Table of Contents of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition. We record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss. Goodwill—Assets Not Subject to Amortization: We perform our annual goodwill impairment test on December 1 of each year and when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. In December 2006, 2005 and 2004, we completed our annual impairment testing related to the goodwill of our rental and management segment and determined that goodwill was not impaired. Fair value estimates are based on our historical and projected operating results and market information, changes to which could affect those fair value estimates. Our December 2005 and 2006 annual impairment testing included approximately $1.6 billion of goodwill acquired in our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. • Revenue Recognition. Rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned, regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts. Fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancelable lease agreements, excluding those tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our customers are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the applicable leases. Straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 approximated $58.3 million, $30.3 million and $24.8 million, respectively. Amounts billed up-front for certain services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases. Amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until such time as the earnings process is complete. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of SFAS No. 109” (FIN 48). This interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109 “Accounting for Income Taxes” and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also provides guidance on recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for us as of January 1, 2007, and the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN 48 will be recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that FIN 48 will have on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS No. 157). This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for us as of January 1, 2008. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that SFAS No. 157 will have on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB No. 108 “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements” (SAB No. 108). SAB No. 108 provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. The SEC staff has indicated that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered, is material. SAB No. 108 is effective for companies with fiscal years ending on or after November 15, 2006. We adopted SAB No. 108 during 2006, and the impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity was not material. 51 Table of Contents In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities—Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (SFAS No. 159). This statement provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 is effective for us as of January 1, 2008. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that SFAS No. 159 will have on our consolidated financial statements. Information Presented Pursuant to the Indentures of our 7.50% Notes, 7.125% Notes and ATI 7.25% Notes The following table sets forth information that is presented solely to address certain tower cash flow reporting requirements contained in the indentures for our 7.50% Notes, 7.125% Notes and ATI 7.25% Notes (collectively, the Notes). The information contained in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements is also presented to address certain reporting requirements contained in the indenture for our ATI 7.25% Notes. The indentures governing the Notes contain restrictive covenants with which we and certain subsidiaries under these indentures must comply. These include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default, which could result in the acceleration of the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest on all the outstanding Notes. In order for the holders of the Notes to assess our compliance with certain of these covenants, the indentures require us to disclose in the periodic reports we file with the SEC our Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non-Tower Cash Flow (each as defined in the indentures). Under the indentures, our ability to make certain types of restricted payments is limited by the amount of Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow that we generate, which is determined based on our Tower Cash Flow and Non-Tower Cash Flow. In addition, the indentures for the Notes restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock if on a pro forma basis the issuance of such debt and preferred stock would cause our consolidated debt to be greater than 7.5 times our Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow. As of December 31, 2006, the ratio of our consolidated debt to Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow was approximately 4.6. For more information about the restrictions under our notes indentures, see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity.” Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non-Tower Cash Flow are considered non-GAAP financial measures. We are required to provide these financial metrics by the indentures for the Notes, and we have included them below because we consider the indentures for the Notes to be material agreements, the covenants related to Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non-Tower Cash Flow to be material terms of the indentures, and information about compliance with such covenants to be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity. These financial metrics do not include the results of SpectraSite or its subsidiaries because such entities are unrestricted subsidiaries under the indentures for the Notes. The following table presents Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non-Tower Cash Flow for the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, as defined in the indentures for the applicable notes (in thousands): Tower Cash Flow, for the three months ended December 31, 2006 $ 157,311 Consolidated Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 $ 591, 050 Less: Tower Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 (612,366 ) Plus: four times Tower Cash Flow, for the three months ended December 31, 2006 629,244 Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 $ 607,928 Non-Tower Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 $ (22,614 ) 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long-term debt obligations. We attempt to reduce these risks by utilizing derivative financial instruments, namely interest rate swaps and caps. All derivative financial instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we repurchased, redeemed and converted $371.1 million face amount of outstanding debt securities for $283.5 million in cash, including the redemption of $227.7 million face amount ($162.1 million accreted value, net of $7.0 million fair value allocated to warrants) of the ATI 12.25% Notes, the conversion of $45.0 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes, the repurchase of $23.5 million principal amount of our 5.0% Notes and the repurchase of $74.9 million principal amount of the ATI 7.25% Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we also drew down an aggregate of $232.0 million under the Delayed Draw Term Loan components of our American Tower and SpectraSite credit facilities to finance debt redemptions and repurchases. The following tables provide information as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates. For long-term debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows by maturity date and average interest rates related to outstanding obligations. For interest rate caps and swaps, the tables present notional principal amounts and weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.

Interest on our credit facilities is payable in accordance with the applicable London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2006 for our credit facilities was 5.30%. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the weighted average interest rate under our credit facilities was 5.92%. As of December 31, 2005, variable rate debt consists of the new American Tower and SpectraSite credit facilities ($1,493.0 million) that were refinanced on October 27, 2005, which are included above based on their October 27, 2010 maturity dates.

Interest on our credit facilities is payable in accordance with the applicable London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2005 for our credit facilities was 4.71%. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the weighted average interest rate under our credit facilities was 5.03%. (b) Includes notional amount of $25,000 that expires in September 2007. (c) Represents the weighted-average fixed rate or range of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts in a given year. (d) Includes notional amounts of $300,000 that expire in December 2009. (e) Includes notional amounts of $550,000 that expire in October 2010. (f) Includes notional amounts of $900,000 for forward starting swaps that expire in July 2012. (g) Includes notional amount of $175,000 that expired in February 2006. (h) Includes notional amounts of $250,000 and $100,000 that expired in June and July 2006, respectively. (i) Includes notional amounts of $450,000 that expire in October 2010. Our foreign operations include rental and management segment divisions in Mexico and Brazil. The remeasurement gains (losses) for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $1,304,000, and $396,000 and $(146,000), respectively. Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt under our credit facilities, after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements (excluding $900.0 million of forward starting interest rate swaps designated as a cash flow hedge as of December 31, 2006, against a future fixed rate debt obligation), is comprised of $875.0 million and $743.0 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. A 10% increase, or approximately 53 and 47 basis point increase in interest rates for the years 54 Table of Contents ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, would have caused an additional pre-tax charge in our net income (loss) and an increase in our cash outflows of $4.6 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, we maintain four interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to variability in cash flows relating to forecasted interest payments in connection with the likely issuance of new fixed rate debt, which we expect to be issued on or before July 31, 2007. The swaps have an aggregate notional amount of $900.0 million and a weighted average fixed rate of approximately 4.97%, and will be terminated upon issuance of new fixed rate debt. We are exposed to market risk for decreases in interest rates until termination of the swaps and if we fail to issue such new fixed rate debt on or before such date. As of December 31, 2006, we expected to receive the fair value of these swap agreements of approximately $3.8 million. As of December 31, 2006, we would be required to pay approximately $19.1 million in cash upon settlement of the swaps if a 10% decline, or approximately 50 basis points, in interest rates were to occur from the fixed rate of the swaps between the issuance date and the settlement date of the swaps. In February 2007, we also entered into two similar forward starting interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $200.0 million and a weighted average fixed rate of 5.06%.",2023-12-30 19:23:35.946951
1053507,AMT,AMERICAN TOWER CORP /MA/,2008,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures in our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” beginning at page 50. Our continuing operations are reported in two segments, rental and management and network development services. Management focuses on segment gross margin and segment operating profit as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments. We define segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization and accretion; selling, general, administrative and development expense; and impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense. We define segment operating profit as segment gross margin less selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. Segment gross margin and segment operating profit for the rental and management segment also include interest income, TV Azteca, net (see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included herein). These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before interest income, interest expense, loss on retirement of long-term obligations, other income (expense), minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries, income on equity method investments, income taxes and discontinued operations. Executive Overview Our principal operating segment is our rental and management segment, which accounted for approximately 98% of our total revenues and approximately 99% of our segment operating profit for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. The primary factors affecting the stability and growth of our revenues and cash flows for this segment are our recurring revenues from existing tenant leases and the contractual escalators in those leases, leasing additional space on our existing towers, acquiring and building additional tower sites and the degree to which any of our existing customer leases are cancelled. We continue to believe that our leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to utilize existing tower capacity. In addition, we believe the majority of our leasing activity will continue to come from customers providing wireless broadband-services. The majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are for an initial term of five to ten years, with multiple five-year renewal terms thereafter. Accordingly, nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of December 2007 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. In addition, most of our leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease. These contractual escalators are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage (generally three to five percent), inflation, or a fixed percentage plus inflation. Revenue generated by rate increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable term of the applicable agreement. We also routinely seek to extend our tenant leases with our customers, which has the effect of increasing the non-cancelable term of the agreement and creating additional stability for our revenues and cash flows. The revenues generated by our rental and management segment also may be affected by cancellations of existing customer leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multi-year contracts, which typically may not be cancelled or, in some instances, may be cancelled only upon payment of a termination fee. Accordingly, lease cancellations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management segment. During the year ended December 31, 2007, tenant leases representing less than 2% of our total revenues were cancelled. 28 Table of Contents A significant majority of our revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2007 was attributable to incremental revenue generated by our existing communications sites. During 2007, incremental revenue attributable to those sites that existed during the entire period between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2007, was approximately $118.3 million, which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites, the effects of straight-line accounting treatment of contractual escalators in our tenant leases and favorable currency exchange rate changes, offset by lease cancellations. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and, to a lesser extent, the location of and available capacity on our existing sites. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure, the financial performance of our customers and their access to capital, and general economic conditions. We believe leasing additional space on our existing sites will contribute the substantial majority of our year-over-year revenue growth in 2008. We also generate revenues by building and acquiring new communications sites. We constructed or acquired 462 and 325 sites in the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Because of the nature of our recurring revenues described above, our results of operations only reflect revenues generated on these sites following the respective dates of their construction or acquisition, which affects year-over-year comparisons. During 2007, incremental revenue attributable to these approximately 790 sites that were built or acquired between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2007, was approximately $13.6 million. We completed our merger with SpectraSite, Inc., an owner and operator of approximately 7,800 wireless and broadcast towers and in-building distributed antenna systems in the United States, in August 2005. As a result, our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 differ significantly from our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005, because our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 include SpectraSite, Inc. for only the five month period following the merger, whereas our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, include SpectraSite, Inc. for each full year period. Our rental and management segment operating expenses include our direct tower level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and utilities. These segment level expenses exclude all segment and corporate, selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling, general, administrative and development expense. Our segment level selling, general and administrative expenses consist of expenses to support our rental and management and network development services segments, such as sales and property management functions. In general, our segment level selling, general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites and increase only modestly year over year. As a result, leasing space to new customers on our existing sites provides significant incremental cash flow. Our profit margin growth is, therefore, directly related to the number of new tenants added to our existing tower sites and the related rental revenue generated in a particular period. 29 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 Year EndedDecember 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2007 2006 (In thousands) REVENUES: Rental and management $ 1,425,975 $ 1,294,068 $ 131,907 10 % Network development services 30,619 23,317 7,302 31 Total revenues 1,456,594 1,317,385 139,209 11 OPERATING EXPENSES: Costs of operations (exclusive of items shown separately below) Rental and management 343,450 332,246 11,204 3 Network development services 16,172 11,291 4,881 43 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 522,928 528,051 (5,123 ) (1 ) Selling, general, administrative and development expense (including $54,603 and $39,502 of stock-based compensation expense, respectively) 186,483 159,324 27,159 17 Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense 9,198 2,572 6,626 258 Total operating expenses 1,078,231 1,033,484 44,747 4 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest income, TV Azteca, net of interest expense $1,490 and $1,491 14,207 14,208 (1 ) Interest income 10,848 9,002 1,846 21 Interest expense (235,824 ) (215,643 ) 20,181 9 Loss on retirement of long-term obligations (35,429 ) (27,223 ) 8,206 30 Other income 20,675 6,619 14,056 212 Income tax provision (59,809 ) (41,768 ) 18,041 43 Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries (338 ) (784 ) (446 ) (57 ) Income on equity method investments 19 26 (7 ) (27 ) Loss from discontinued operations, net (36,396 ) (854 ) 35,542 4,162 Net income $ 56,316 $ 27,484 $ 28,832 105 % Total Revenues Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $1,456.6 million, an increase of $139.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $131.9 million of the increase was attributable to an increase in rental and management revenue. The balance of the increase resulted from an increase in network development services revenue of $7.3 million. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $1,426.0 million, an increase of $131.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $118.3 million of the increase resulted from incremental revenue generated by communications sites that existed during the entire period between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2007, which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites, contractual escalators, net of straight-line accounting 30 Table of Contents treatment, favorable currency exchange rates and the net increase in straight-line revenue from extending the renewal dates of thousands of our tenant leases, partially offset by lease cancellations. Approximately $13.6 million of the increase resulted from approximately 790 communications sites acquired and/or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2006. We believe that our rental and management revenue will grow as we continue to utilize existing site capacity. We anticipate that the majority of our new leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $30.6 million, an increase of $7.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to revenues generated by our structural analysis services, related in part to our January 2007 acquisition of a structural analysis engineering firm, which enabled us to increase our structural analysis capabilities. As we continue to focus on and grow our site leasing business, however, we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $1,078.2 million, an increase of $44.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was attributable to an increase in selling, general, administrative and development expense of $27.2 million, an increase in expenses within our rental and management segment of $11.2 million, an increase in expenses within our network development services segment of $4.9 million and an increase in impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense of $6.6 million. These increases were offset by a decrease in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense of $5.1 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Gross Margin/Segment Operating Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $343.5 million, an increase of $11.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $7.5 million of the increase was attributable to communications sites which existed during the period between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2007, and approximately $3.7 million of the increase was related to approximately 790 sites acquired and/or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2006. The increase in expenses related to existing towers as of January 1, 2006 resulted primarily from increases in ground rent. Rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $1,096.7 million, an increase of $120.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase resulted from the additional rental and management revenue described above, partially offset by the increase in rental and management expense. Rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $1,030.8 million, an increase of $115.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. This was comprised of the $120.7 million increase in rental and management segment gross margin described above, net of an increase of $4.8 million in selling, general, administrative and development expenses related to the rental and management segment. Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $16.2 million, an increase of $4.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The majority of the increase correlates to the growth in services performed as noted above. 31 Table of Contents Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $522.9 million, a decrease of $5.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease was primarily attributable to the finalization in June 2006 of the purchase price allocation related to long-lived assets acquired in connection with the SpectraSite merger, which resulted in decreases in the fair values of certain intangible assets and changes in the estimated useful lives of certain tangible and intangible assets. As discussed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included herein, we are in the process of reviewing the estimated useful lives of our tower assets. We now have over ten years of operating history, and we are considering whether we should modify our current estimates for asset lives based on our historical operating experience. We have retained an independent consultant to assist us in completing this review, and we received a report from the consultant in the first quarter of 2008, which we are in the process of analyzing. If we conclude that a revision in the estimated useful lives of our tower assets is appropriate, we will account for any changes in the useful lives as a change in accounting estimate under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 154 “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,” which will be recorded prospectively beginning in the period of change. Based on preliminary information obtained to date, we expect that our estimated asset lives may be extended, which would result in prospective decreases in depreciation and amortization, and such changes could be material to future depreciation and amortization and our consolidated results of operations. Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense Selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $186.5 million, an increase of $27.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $15.1 million in stock-based compensation expense and a decrease of $2.3 million in costs associated with the legal and governmental proceedings related to the review of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting, and other related costs. See “—Stock Option Review and Related Matters” below. Stock-based compensation expense included $7.6 million related to the modification of certain stock option awards for two members of senior management who terminated their employment during the year ended December 31, 2007. The remaining $14.4 million net increase was primarily the result of increases in employee compensation expenses other than stock-based compensation expense, primarily related to administrative, information technology and business development activities. Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long-lived Assets, Restructuring and Merger Related Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $9.2 million, an increase of $6.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to a $3.1 million increase in impairments and net loss on sale of long-lived assets. Interest Income Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $10.8 million, an increase of $1.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in average interest-earning cash balances. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $235.8 million, an increase of $20.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to an approximately 9% increase in our average outstanding debt, as a result of the debt financing activities described in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below and note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included herein. 32 Table of Contents Loss on Retirement of Long-Term Obligations During the year ended December 31, 2007, approximately $89.5 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes were converted into shares of our Class A common stock, and we repurchased pursuant to tender offers approximately $192.5 million principal amount of our 5.0% Notes and $324.8 million principal amount of our ATI 7.25% Notes. We also repaid all amounts outstanding under the credit facilities of SpectraSite and at the AMT OpCo level and terminated all commitments thereunder. In addition, we repaid all amounts outstanding under our $500.0 million senior unsecured term loan credit facility and terminated the loan. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a charge of $35.4 million related to amounts paid in excess of the carrying value and the write-off of related deferred financing fees. During the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately $45.0 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes were converted into shares of our Class A common stock, and we repurchased approximately $74.9 million principal amount of our ATI 7.25% Notes and $23.5 million principal amount of our 5.0% Notes. In addition, on February 1, 2006, we redeemed $227.7 million aggregate principal amount ($162.1 million accreted value, net of $7.0 million fair value discount allocated to warrants) of our ATI 12.25% Notes in accordance with the indenture at 106.125% of their accreted value for an aggregate of $179.5 million. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a charge of $27.2 million related to amounts paid in excess of the carrying value and the write-off of related deferred financing fees. For more information regarding our financing activities, see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Refinancing Activities and Repurchases of Debt” below. Other Income Other income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $20.7 million, an increase of $14.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $5.5 million of gains recognized on the sale of our common stock investment in FiberTower Corporation and an increase of $6.2 million in gains recognized from the mark to market and subsequent settlement of certain interest rate swap agreements. Income Tax Provision The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $59.8 million, as compared to $41.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, representing an increase of $18.0 million from the prior year period. The effective tax rate was 39.1% for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 58.9% for the year ended December 31, 2006. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the reversal of $27.6 million of valuation allowances on net state deferred tax assets offset by a $7.6 million deferred tax liability recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2007 related to unrealized foreign currency gains on intercompany loans with our Brazilian subsidiary. These items are described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included herein. Other differences from the federal statutory rate include other foreign items, settlement of tax reserves, non-deductible stock-based compensation expense, additional tax reserves and state taxes. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to foreign items, non-deductible losses on conversions of our 3.25% Notes and state taxes. In the year ended December 31, 2007, we also received a federal income tax refund from the IRS of approximately $65.0 million, plus $15.0 million in interest. The refund resulted from claims by us filed with the IRS in June 2003 and October 2003, which related to the carry back of net operating losses. 33 Table of Contents During the three months ended December 31, 2007, we recorded adjustments to the income tax provision for amounts that should have been recorded in prior reporting periods. The adjustments were identified in connection with our year-end tax analyses and audit of the consolidated financial statements and relate primarily to our cumulative deferred tax assets and liabilities. Recording these out-of-period adjustments for the three months ended December 31, 2007 had the effect of increasing the income tax provision by $7.9 million and decreasing income from continuing operations by approximately $4.8 million (inclusive of certain non-tax related adjustments) (see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net The loss from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $37.8 million of net losses related to Verestar and $1.4 million in net gains related to litigation and insurance settlements that were settled for less than the original estimates. The loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily due to the settlement of the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings and related litigation described in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included herein and the related tax effects. In November 2007, following approval by the bankruptcy court, the Verestar settlement agreement became effective, we paid the $32.0 million settlement amount and the litigation was dismissed. In connection with the approval of the settlement agreement by the bankruptcy court and the dismissal of the bankruptcy proceedings and related litigation, we determined that the benefits from certain of Verestar’s net operating losses would more likely than not be recoverable by us. We had not previously recorded these tax benefits related to net operating losses generated from the operations of Verestar and used by us because our ability to realize such benefits was potentially impacted by the bankruptcy proceedings and related litigation that had yet to be resolved. Accordingly, in November 2007, we recorded $5.6 million of additional tax benefits related to Verestar. We also recorded a tax provision of $10.7 million in loss from discontinued operations, net during the three months ended December 31, 2007 to write off deferred tax assets associated with Verestar that should have been written off in 2002 and removed from the consolidated balance sheet when Verestar was deconsolidated upon its bankruptcy filing in December 2003 (see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). 34 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 Year EndedDecember 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2006 2005 (In thousands) REVENUES: Rental and management $ 1,294,068 $ 929,762 $ 364,306 39 % Network development services 23,317 15,024 8,293 55 Total revenues 1,317,385 944,786 372,599 39 OPERATING EXPENSES: Costs of operations (exclusive of items shown separately below) Rental and management 332,246 247,781 84,465 34 Network development services 11,291 8,346 2,945 35 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 528,051 411,254 116,797 28 Selling, general, administrative and development expense (including $39,502 and $6,597 of stock-based compensation expense, respectively) 159,324 108,059 51,265 47 Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense (including $9,333 of stock-based compensation expense in 2005) 2,572 34,232 (31,660 ) (92 ) Total operating expenses 1,033,484 809,672 223,812 28 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest income, TV Azteca, net of interest expense $1,491 and $1,492 14,208 14,232 (24 ) (0 ) Interest income 9,002 4,402 4,600 104 Interest expense (215,643 ) (222,419 ) (6,776 ) (3 ) Loss on retirement of long-term obligations (27,223 ) (67,110 ) (39,887 ) (59 ) Other income 6,619 227 6,392 2,816 Income tax provision (41,768 ) (5,714 ) 36,054 631 Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries (784 ) (575 ) 209 36 Income (loss) on equity method investments 26 (2,078 ) 2,104 101 Loss from discontinued operations, net (854 ) (1,913 ) (1,059 ) (55 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net (35,525 ) (35,525 ) N/A Net income (loss) $ 27,484 $ (181,359 ) $ 208,843 115 % Total Revenues Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $1,317.4 million, an increase of $372.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. Approximately $274.6 million of the increase was attributable to revenues generated by SpectraSite. The balance of the increase resulted from an increase in other rental and management revenue of $90.1 and an increase in other network development services revenue of $7.9 million. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $1,294.1 million, an increase of $364.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. Approximately $274.2 million of the increase was attributable to revenues generated by SpectraSite. Approximately $79.1 million of the increase resulted from 35 Table of Contents incremental revenue generated by communications sites that existed during the entire period between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006, which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites, the effects of straight-line accounting treatment of contractual escalators in our tenant leases and favorable currency exchange rates, offset by lease cancellations. Approximately $11.0 million of the increase resulted from revenue generated by the approximately 614 communications sites acquired and/or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2005, other than in connection with the SpectraSite merger. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $23.3 million, an increase of $8.3 million from year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to revenues generated by our structural analysis services due to the increased business associated with our significantly larger communications site portfolio, primarily as a result of sites acquired from SpectraSite. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $1,033.5 million, an increase of $223.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was attributable to an increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense of $116.8 million, an increase in expenses within our rental and management segment of $84.5 million, an increase in selling, general, administrative and development expense of $51.3 million and an increase in expenses within our network development services segment of $2.9 million. These increases were offset by a decrease in impairments, net loss of sale on long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense of $31.7 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Gross Margin/Segment Operating Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $332.2 million, an increase of $84.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. Approximately $78.8 million of the increase was attributable to expenses incurred by SpectraSite. Approximately $2.8 million of the increase was related to 614 sites acquired and/or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2005, other than sites acquired from SpectraSite. The remaining $2.9 million of the increase was attributable to communications sites which existed during the period between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006, primarily related to increases in ground rent expense. Rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $976.0 million, an increase of $279.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. Approximately $195.5 million of the increase resulted from communications sites acquired from SpectraSite. The balance of the increase resulted from the additional rental and management revenue, net of related expenses, described above. Rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $914.9 million, an increase of $277.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was comprised of the $279.8 million increase in rental and management segment gross margin described above, net of a $2.7 million increase in selling, general, administrative and development expenses related to the rental and management segment. Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $11.3 million, an increase of $2.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The majority of the increase correlates directly to the increase in services performed as noted above. 36 Table of Contents Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $528.1 million, an increase of $116.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. Approximately $116.2 million of the increase was attributable to depreciation, amortization and accretion expense related to long-lived assets acquired in connection with the SpectraSite merger. Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense Selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $159.3 million, an increase of $51.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $32.9 million in stock-based compensation expense and $16.2 million in costs associated with the review of our stock option granting practices and related legal and governmental proceedings, and other related costs. See “—Stock Option Review and Related Matters” below. The remaining net increase was primarily the result of the inclusion of SpectraSite expenses for the full year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to the five months post-merger for the year ended December 31, 2005. Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long-lived Assets, Restructuring and Merger Related Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $2.6 million, a decrease of $31.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease was primarily due to a $16.1 million decrease in impairments and net loss on sale of long-lived assets, an $11.3 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense and related payroll taxes associated with restructuring and merger activities and a $3.1 million decrease in severance, retention and other employee expenses associated with the 2005 SpectraSite merger. The net decrease of $16.1 million in impairments and net loss on sale of long-lived assets was primarily comprised of a $9.2 million reduction in impairments related to towers with no current tenant leases and gains from asset sales totaling $5.1 million. The gains from asset sales included the sale of 27 towers in one transaction and sales of other non-core assets. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $215.6 million, a decrease of $6.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in interest expense of approximately $49.8 million as a result of redemptions and repurchases of outstanding debt securities, offset by additional interest incurred related to the SpectraSite credit facility and higher borrowing levels on the AMT OpCo credit facility totaling approximately $45.3 million. Loss on Retirement of Long-Term Obligations During the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately $45.0 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes were converted into shares of our Class A common stock, and we repurchased approximately $74.9 million principal amount of ATI 7.25% Notes and $23.5 million principal amount of 5.0% Notes. In connection with these transactions, we paid the noteholders an aggregate of $104.0 million in cash, including accrued interest. In addition, on February 1, 2006, we redeemed $227.7 million aggregate principal amount ($162.1 million accreted value, net of $7.0 million fair value discount allocated to warrants) of ATI 12.25% Notes in accordance with the indenture at 106.125% of their accreted value for an aggregate of $179.5 million. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a charge of $27.2 million related to amounts paid in excess of the carrying value and the write-off of related deferred financing fees. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we redeemed $274.9 million principal amount of our 9 3/8% senior notes due 2009 (“9 3/8% Notes”), repurchased $177.8 million accreted value of our ATI 12.25% Notes and converted $57.1 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes. In addition, we refinanced the AMT OpCo and SpectraSite credit facilities. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a $67.1 million charge primarily 37 Table of Contents related to the write-off of deferred financing fees and amounts paid in excess of the carrying value. For more information regarding our financing activities, see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Refinancing Activities and Repurchases of Debt” below. Other Income Other income for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $6.6 million, an increase of $6.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to a $5.4 million gain realized during the quarter ended December 31, 2006 from the sale of 1.6 million shares of FiberTower Corporation, an investment we had previously accounted for under the cost method. As of December 31, 2006, we recorded our remaining 3.9 million shares of FiberTower as available-for-sale securities within the current assets of our consolidated balance sheet, with an unrealized gain of $10.4 million, net of tax, recorded within other comprehensive income. Income Tax Provision The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $41.8 million, as compared to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, representing an increase of $36.1 million from the prior year period. The effective tax rate was 58.9% for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The provision for the year ended December 31, 2005 reflects a $29.5 million charge as a result of a reduction in management’s estimate of the net realizable value of our federal income tax refund claims based upon the current status of the claims. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to foreign items, IRS audit adjustments and state taxes. The effective tax rate on loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to our refund claims, foreign items, IRS audit adjustments and state taxes. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net Loss from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $0.8 million, as compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The loss from discontinued operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 primarily represents the legal costs incurred in connection with our involvement in the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings. Stock Option Review and Related Matters During the year ended December 31, 2006, our Board of Directors established a special committee of independent directors to conduct a review of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting, as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006. The special committee found, among other things, that in the past, we had granted options to purchase shares of our Class A common stock with exercise prices different from the market price of our stock on the date of grant. As a result of the special committee’s findings, we restated our historical financial statements to, among other things, record charges for stock-based compensation expense related to certain option grants and to account for the tax-related consequences. In December 2006, our Board of Directors approved a remediation plan recommended by the special committee to address the issues raised by its findings. As part of the remediation plan, we took steps to eliminate any excess benefit received by our current officers and members of the Board of Directors from options having been granted to them with exercise prices below the market price on the legal grant date. For outstanding options, this was accomplished by amending each option to increase the exercise price to the fair market value on the legal grant date, without any compensation to the optionholder. In December 2006, eight of our senior officers and Directors amended the exercise prices of options to purchase an aggregate of 985,511 shares, thereby 38 Table of Contents eliminating an aggregate excess benefit of approximately $6.5 million. For options that had been exercised, this was accomplished by compensating the Company for the amount of the excess benefit received upon exercise, after reduction for any taxes paid by the individual. In January 2007, five of the Company’s senior officers surrendered vested in-the-money options to purchase an aggregate of 23,269 shares, thereby surrendering an aggregate excess benefit of approximately $0.6 million (net of approximately $0.4 million in taxes paid by such individuals). In addition, we took similar steps to eliminate any excess benefit received by certain former officers from the grant to them of options with exercise prices below fair market value on the legal grant date. In December 2006, January 2007 and April 2007, three former officers amended the exercise prices of options to purchase an aggregate of 1,423,330 shares, thereby eliminating an aggregate excess benefit of approximately $4.3 million, and surrendered vested in-the-money options to purchase an aggregate of 52,212 shares, thereby surrendering an aggregate excess benefit, net of taxes paid by such individuals, of approximately $3.2 million. In addition, we determined that under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (“Section 409A”), options that were granted with exercise prices below the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant and that vest after December 31, 2004 would likely be subject to unfavorable tax consequences that did not apply at the time of grant. In order to compensate our non-executive employees who previously exercised affected options and already incurred taxes and penalties under Section 409A, we paid approximately $1.1 million on behalf of such individuals for these taxes during the year ended December 31, 2007. In order to remedy the unfavorable personal tax consequences of Section 409A on holders of outstanding options, we conducted a tender offer in December 2006 for the affected options, pursuant to which we offered to amend the affected options to increase the option exercise price to the market price on the revised grant date, and to give the option holders (excluding officers and Directors) a cash payment for the difference in option exercise price between the amended option and the original price. We accounted for the financial impact of the tender offer as a stock option modification under SFAS No. 123R resulting in an increase to stock-based compensation expense and additional paid-in capital of $0.3 million in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006 and an additional $1.2 million recognized for the year ended December 31, 2007. Following completion of the tender offer, in January 2007, we paid an aggregate of approximately $3.9 million in cash to holders of options that were amended in the tender offer. As discussed above in Item 3 of this Annual Report under the caption “Legal Proceedings,” we have received a letter of informal inquiry from the SEC, a subpoena from the office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, information document requests from the IRS and requests for information from the Department of Labor, each requesting documents and information related to our stock option granting practices. In addition, we and certain of our current and former officers and directors are defendants in lawsuits related to our historical stock option granting practices. In connection with the review of our historical stock option granting practices, the restatement of our historical financial statements and the related legal and governmental proceedings, we have incurred significant legal, accounting and auditing expenses, and we expect to continue to incur legal expenditures in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we improved our financial position by raising capital to refinance and repurchase a portion of our outstanding indebtedness, which increased our financial flexibility and our ability to return value to our stockholders. Our significant 2007 transactions included the following: • The completion of our Securitization involving assets related to the 5,295 broadcast and wireless communications towers owned by two of our special purpose subsidiaries, through a private offering of $1.75 billion of Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-1. We used the net proceeds from the Securitization primarily to repay outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities and to fund a tender offer and consent solicitation for our ATI 7.25% Notes. 39 Table of Contents • The refinancing of our credit facilities, including the repayment and termination of the senior secured credit facilities of our principal operating subsidiaries. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the Securitization to repay and terminate the credit facilities of SpectraSite and to repay a portion of the AMT OpCo credit facilities. We then implemented our new $1.25 billion Revolving Credit Facility, which we drew down in part to repay and terminate the AMT OpCo credit facilities. • The completion of an institutional private placement of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.00% Notes. We used the net proceeds from the offering of the 7.00% Notes primarily to repay outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities. • The repurchase or conversion of approximately $606.8 million face amount of our outstanding debt securities, including the repurchase of $192.5 million principal amount of our 5.0% Notes, the repurchase of $324.8 million principal amount of our ATI 7.25% Notes and the conversion of $89.5 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes into shares of our Class A common stock. • The repurchase of approximately 39.9 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate of $1.6 billion under our stock repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2007, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $4.3 billion. We generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and cash interest obligations in 2007. We believe our cash generated by operations for the year ending December 31, 2008 also will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and our cash debt service (interest and principal repayments) obligations for 2008. For information about our outstanding indebtedness, see “—Contractual Obligations” below. Our debt service obligations as of December 31, 2007 are set forth under “—Uses of Cash—Contractual Obligations” below, which reflects an aggregate of $252.0 million of cash payments to be made in 2008. During 2008, we expect that we will raise additional capital to fund stock repurchases, repurchase existing debt and for other general corporate purposes. Uses of Cash Stock Repurchase Programs. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we continued to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock pursuant to our publicly announced stock repurchase programs, as described below. In February 2007, we completed our $750.0 million stock repurchase program, originally announced in November 2005. Pursuant to this repurchase program, we repurchased 8.8 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate of $351.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. In February 2007, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of our Class A common stock through February 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we repurchased 31.1 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate of $1.3 billion pursuant to this program. Subsequent to December 31, 2007, we repurchased an additional 4.3 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate of $163.7 million. As of February 29, 2008, we had repurchased a total of 35.3 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate of $1.45 billion pursuant to this stock repurchase program. In February 2008, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to purchase up to an additional $1.5 billion of our Class A common stock. We expect to fund repurchases through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and future financing transactions. Purchases under this stock repurchase program are subject to us having available cash to fund repurchases. Under the program, we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. To facilitate repurchases, we plan to make purchases pursuant to trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, which allow us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. 40 Table of Contents For more information regarding our stock repurchase programs, please see Item 5 of this Annual Report under the caption “Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” and note 13 to our consolidated financial statements herein. Tower Maintenance and Improvements, Tower Construction and In-Building System Installation, and Tower and Land Acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2007, payments for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities totaled $154.4 million, including $66.5 million of capital expenditures related to the maintenance, improvement and augmentation of our existing communication sites, $30.7 million spent in connection with the construction of 152 towers and the installation of 17 in-building distributed antenna systems, $44.4 million spent to acquire land under our towers that was subject to ground agreements (including leases), and $12.7 million spent on information technology improvements. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2007, we spent $36.9 million to acquire 293 towers and $7.1 million to acquire the assets of a structural analysis engineering firm. We plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet our return criteria. Accordingly, we may continue to acquire communications sites, acquire land under our towers, build or install new communications sites and redevelop or improve existing communications sites when the expected returns on such investments meet our investment criteria. We anticipate that in 2008 we will construct approximately 300 to 400 new sites, including in-building systems, and we expect that our 2008 total capital expenditures will be between approximately $185.0 million and $215.0 million, including between $40.0 million and $60.0 million of ground lease purchases. Refinancing and Repurchases of Debt. In order to extend the maturity dates of our indebtedness, lower our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility, we use our available liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we used approximately $545.8 million in cash to repurchase or convert approximately $606.8 million face amount of our outstanding debt securities, including the repurchase of $192.5 million principal amount of our 5.0% Notes, the repurchase of $324.8 million principal amount of our ATI 7.25% Notes and the conversion of $89.5 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes into shares of our Class A common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we also implemented the Revolving Credit Facility and a new senior unsecured term loan credit facility (the “Term Loan”). All amounts outstanding under the credit facilities at our principal operating subsidiaries were repaid and then terminated during the year ended December 31, 2007. In October 2007, we also repaid and terminated the Term Loan. For more information about our financing activities, see “—Refinancing Activities and Repurchases of Debt” below. Expenses Related to Stock Option Review and Related Matters. In connection with the review of our historical stock option granting practices, the restatement of our historical financial statements and the related legal and governmental proceedings, we have incurred significant legal, accounting and auditing expenses, and we expect to continue to incur legal expenditures in the future. For more information regarding the review of our historical stock option granting practices and the related proceedings, please see “—Stock Option Review and Related Matters” above and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we incurred approximately $13.8 million in costs associated with legal and governmental proceedings related to the review of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting, and other related costs. Depending on the outcomes of these proceedings, we and members of our senior management could be subject to regulatory fines, penalties, enforcement actions or other liability. In December 2007, we announced that we had reached a settlement in principle regarding the securities class action related to our historical stock option granting practices. The settlement, which was preliminarily approved by the court in February 2008, provides for a payment by us of $14.0 million and would lead to a dismissal of all claims against all defendants in the litigation. We have reached agreements with our insurers related to the settlement, pursuant to which we expect to receive approximately $12.5 million in insurance proceeds. We expect to pay the settlement amount, and receive the associated insurance proceeds, in the first half of 2008. For more information regarding the litigation related to our historical stock option granting practices, please see “Legal Proceedings” above and note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. 41 Table of Contents Verestar. As discussed in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, in October 2007, we finalized a settlement agreement related to the bankruptcy proceedings and related litigation of our Verestar subsidiary, pursuant to which we agreed to pay $32.0 million and the parties agreed to a mutual release of all claims existing prior to the execution of the settlement agreement. In November 2007, following approval by the Bankruptcy Court, the settlement agreement became effective, and the litigation was dismissed. We paid the $32.0 million settlement amount in November 2007 and are in discussions with our insurers concerning the amount of their contribution to the settlement. Contractual Obligations. Our contractual obligations relate primarily to the Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-1 issued in the Securitization, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, our outstanding notes and our operating leases related to the ground under our towers. The following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations payable in cash as of December 31, 2007 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-1 $ 1,750,000 $ 1,750,000 Revolving Credit Facility(1) $ 825,000 825,000 7.25% senior subordinated notes $ 288 288 7.50% senior notes 225,000 225,000 7.125% senior notes 500,000 500,000 7.00% senior notes 500,000 500,000 5.0% convertible notes $ 59,683 59,683 3.25% convertible notes 18,333 18,333 3.00% convertible notes 344,979 344,979 2.25% convertible notes $ 42 42 Long-term obligations, excluding capital leases and other notes payable $ 42 $ 78,016 $ 288 $ 1,894,979 $ 2,250,000 $ 4,223,325 Cash interest expense(1) 246,000 246,000 243,000 243,000 194,000 290,000 1,462,000 Capital lease payments (including interest) and other notes payable 5,996 5,448 4,961 24,166 3,416 193,193 237,180 Total debt service obligations $ 252,038 $ 251,448 $ 325,977 $ 267,454 $ 2,092,395 $ 2,733,193 $ 5,922,505 Operating lease payments(2) 217,969 215,763 208,548 199,024 190,272 2,451,496 3,483,072 Other long-term liabilities(3)(4) 155 172 177 182 187 189,290 190,163 Total $ 470,162 $ 467,383 $ 534,702 $ 466,660 $ 2,282,854 $ 5,373,979 $ 9,595,740 (1) For more information regarding the Revolving Credit Facility, see “—Sources of Cash” below. Interest rates for the Revolving Credit Facility are determined at our option and range between 0.40% and 1.25% above the applicable London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.00% and 0.25% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on our debt ratings. A quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the Revolving Credit Facility is required, ranging from 0.08% to 0.25% per annum, based on our debt ratings. As discussed in Item 7A. “Quantitative and 42 Table of Contents Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” we have entered into swap agreements to manage exposure to variable rate interest obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility. As a result of these swap agreements, the effective weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2007 for the Revolving Credit Facility was 5.52%. For projections of our cash interest expense related to the Revolving Credit Facility, we have assumed the LIBOR rate before the margin, as defined in the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility, is 4.83% through its maturity on June 7, 2012. (2) Operating lease payments include payments to be made under non-cancelable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable tower site and related revenues from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that we will renew the lease. (3) Primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other long-term liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily our straight-line rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash. (4) Other long-term liabilities exclude $29.6 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and $30.7 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled. Settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations. As discussed in notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we adopted FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007 which resulted in the classification of uncertain tax positions as non-current income tax liabilities. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe. However, based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements, we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Sources of Cash American Tower Corporation is a holding company, and our cash flows are derived primarily from distributions from our operating subsidiaries or funds raised through credit facilities and debt and equity offerings. Under the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures for our 7.50% Notes, 7.125% Notes and 7.00% Notes, our subsidiaries are classified as either restricted subsidiaries or unrestricted subsidiaries. With regard to the indentures for our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes (which generally contain more restrictions than the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility or the indenture for our 7.00% Notes), most of our operating subsidiaries other than SpectraSite are designated as restricted subsidiaries. This means, among other things, that those subsidiaries, like American Tower Corporation itself, are subject to those indentures’ restrictions on the amount of cash that they can distribute to unrestricted subsidiaries or otherwise pay out of the restricted group. In addition, while SpectraSite and its subsidiaries are classified as unrestricted subsidiaries under the indentures for our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes, certain of SpectraSite’s subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the amount of cash that they can distribute to us under the loan agreement for the Securitization, as discussed below. Total Liquidity at December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $444.4 million of total liquidity, comprised of approximately $33.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to borrow approximately $411.3 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. Cash Generated by Operations. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, our cash provided by operating activities was $692.7 million, $620.7 million and $397.2 million, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes approximately $80.0 million received in connection with our federal income tax refund, as discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 43 Table of Contents herein, as well as a reduction of approximately $49.8 million of net cash receipts related to towers included in the Securitization, which are classified as restricted cash, and a reduction of $32.0 million related to the payment of the Verestar settlement amount. Each of our rental and management and network development services segments are expected to generate cash flows from operations during 2008 in excess of their cash needs for operations and expenditures for tower construction, improvements and acquisitions. (See “—Results of Operations” above.) We expect to use the excess cash generated by operations principally to service our debt and to fund capital expenditures, tower acquisitions and repurchases of our Class A common stock. Revolving Credit Facility. In June 2007, we refinanced our existing $1.6 billion AMT OpCo senior secured credit facilities with the new $1.25 billion Revolving Credit Facility. We borrowed $1.0 billion under the Revolving Credit Facility and together with cash on hand, used the funds to repay all amounts outstanding under the existing AMT OpCo credit facilities plus accrued interest thereon and other costs and expenses related thereto. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we drew down and repaid amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility in the ordinary course, and also repaid $450.0 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility using net proceeds from our Term Loan, as discussed below. As of December 31, 2007, we had the ability to borrow approximately $411.3 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. As of February 29, 2008, we had drawn down an additional $150.0 million, and reduced our undrawn letters of credit to $11.9 million. Accordingly, as of February 29, 2008, we had the ability to borrow approximately $263.1 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility has a term of five years and matures on June 8, 2012. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The Revolving Credit Facility does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. The Revolving Credit Facility allows us to use borrowings for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes of us and our subsidiaries (including, without limitation, to refinance or repurchase other indebtedness and, provided certain conditions are met, to repurchase our equity securities, in each case without additional lender approval). For more information regarding our Revolving Credit Facility, please see “—Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity” below and note 3 to our consolidated financial statements herein. Term Loan Credit Facility. In August 2007, we entered into a new $500.0 million Term Loan. In connection with that transaction, we received $498.5 million of net proceeds from the Term Loan, which we used to repay $450.0 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes. In October 2007, we completed an institutional private placement of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.00% Notes, as discussed below, and used the net proceeds, together with cash on hand, to repay all of the outstanding indebtedness incurred under the Term Loan in accordance with the mandatory prepayment requirement. We terminated the Term Loan upon repayment. For more information regarding the Term Loan, please see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements herein. Previous Credit Facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we also maintained two credit facilities at our principal operating subsidiaries, the SpectraSite credit facilities and the AMT OpCo credit facilities. We repaid and terminated the SpectraSite credit facilities and the AMT OpCo credit facilities in May and June 2007, respectively. For more information regarding the SpectraSite credit facilities and the AMT OpCo credit facilities, please see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements herein. 44 Table of Contents Proceeds from the Sale of Equity Securities. We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plans and upon exercise of warrants to purchase our equity securities. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we received an aggregate of approximately $124.1 million in proceeds from sales of shares pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, upon exercises of stock options and upon exercises of warrants. Proceeds from the Sale of Assets. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we received $22.2 million in aggregate net proceeds related to sales of non-core assets, including $5.1 million from sales of tower assets and buildings and $17.1 million from sales of short-term available-for-sale securities. Refinancing Activities and Repurchases of Debt Securitization. In May 2007, we completed the Securitization involving assets related to 5,295 broadcast and wireless communications towers (the “Towers”) owned by two of our special purpose subsidiaries, through a private offering of $1.75 billion of Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-1 (the “Certificates”). The Certificates were issued by American Tower Trust I (the “Trust”), a trust established by American Tower Depositor Sub, LLC (the “Depositor”), one of our indirect wholly owned special purpose subsidiaries. The assets of the Trust consist of a recourse loan (the “Loan”) initially made by the Depositor to American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (the “Borrowers”), pursuant to a Loan and Security Agreement among the foregoing parties dated as of May 4, 2007 (the “Loan Agreement”). The Borrowers are special purpose entities formed solely for the purpose of holding the Towers subject to the Securitization. As indicated in the table below, the Certificates were issued in seven separate classes. Each of the Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E and Class F Certificates are subordinated in right of payment to any other class of Certificates which has an earlier alphabetical designation. The Certificates were issued with terms identical to the Loan except for the Class A-FL Certificates, which bear interest at a floating rate while the related component of the Loan bears interest at a fixed rate, as described below. The various classes of Certificates were issued with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.61%. The Certificates have an expected life of approximately seven years with a final repayment date in April 2037. Class Initial ClassPrincipal Balance Interest Rate Rating (Moody’s/Fitch/S&P) Class A-FX $ 872,000,000 5.4197% Aaa/AAA/AAA Class A-FL $ 150,000,000 LIBOR+0.1900(a) Aaa/AAA/AAA Class B $ 215,000,000 5.5370% Aa2/AA/AA Class C $ 110,000,000 5.6151% A2/A/A Class D $ 275,000,000 5.9568% Baa2/BBB/BBB Class E $ 55,000,000 6.2493% Baa3/BBB-/BBB- Class F $ 73,000,000 6.6388% Baa3/BBB-/BB+ (a) The Class A-FL Certificates bear interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR, but interest on the related component of the Loan is computed at a fixed rate equal to the interest rate on the Class A-FX Certificates. Holders of the Class A-FL Certificates have the benefit of an interest rate swap agreement between the Trust and Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc. Neither we nor the Borrowers have any obligations or liability with respect to this interest rate swap agreement. We used the net proceeds from the Securitization to repay all amounts outstanding under the SpectraSite credit facilities, including approximately $765.0 million in principal, plus accrued interest thereon and other costs and expenses related thereto, as well as to repay approximately $250.0 million drawn under the revolving loan component of the AMT OpCo credit facilities. An additional $349.5 million of the proceeds was used to fund our 45 Table of Contents tender offer and consent solicitation for our ATI 7.25% Notes, and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes. We also funded $14.3 million in cash reserve accounts with proceeds from the Securitization as required under the Loan Agreement. The Loan will be paid by the Borrowers solely from the cash flows generated by the Towers. These funds in turn will be used by or on behalf of the Trust to service the payment of interest on the Certificates and for any other payments required by the Loan Agreement. The Borrowers are required to make monthly payments of interest on the Loan. Subject to certain limited exceptions, no payments of principal will be required to be made prior to the anticipated repayment date for the Loan in April 2014. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the Loan Agreement and subject to certain exceptions, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of the Towers are released to the Borrowers, which can then be distributed to, and used by, us. The Borrowers may not prepay the Loan in whole or in part at any time prior to May 2009, except in limited circumstances, including the occurrence of certain casualty and condemnation events relating to the Towers and certain dispositions of Towers. Thereafter, prepayment is permitted provided it is accompanied by applicable prepayment consideration. If the prepayment occurs within nine months of the anticipated repayment date, no prepayment consideration is due. The entire unpaid principal balance of the Loan components will be due in April 2037. The Loan may be defeased in whole or in part at any time. The Loan is secured by (1) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the Towers and their operating cash flows, (2) a security interest in substantially all of the Borrowers’ personal property and fixtures and (3) the Borrowers’ rights under the Management Agreement dated as of May 4, 2007 with SpectraSite, as manager. American Tower Holding Sub, LLC, whose only material assets are its equity interests in each of the Borrowers, and American Tower Guarantor Sub, LLC, whose only material asset is its equity interest in American Tower Holding Sub, LLC, each have guaranteed repayment of the Loan and pledged their equity interests in their respective subsidiary or subsidiaries as security for such payment obligations. American Tower Guarantor Sub, LLC, American Tower Holding Sub, LLC, the Depositor and the Borrowers each were formed as special purpose entities solely for purposes of the Securitization, and the assets and credit of these entities are not available to satisfy the debts and other obligations of us or any other person, except as set forth in the Loan Agreement. Under the Loan Agreement, the Borrowers are required to maintain reserve accounts, including for debt service payments, ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes, insurance premiums and management fees, and to reserve a portion of advance rents from tenants on the Towers. Based on the terms of the Loan Agreement, all rental cash receipts received each month are restricted and held by the Trustee. The $53.7 million held in the reserve accounts as of December 31, 2007 is classified as restricted cash on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. For more information regarding the Securitization, please see “—Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity” below and note 3 to our consolidated financial statements herein. 7.00% Senior Notes Offering. In October 2007, we completed an institutional private placement of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.00% Notes. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $493.5 million, which we used, together with cash on hand, to repay all of the outstanding indebtedness incurred under our $500.0 million Term Loan. We terminated the Term Loan upon repayment. The 7.00% Notes mature on October 15, 2017, and interest is payable semiannually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on April 15, 2008, to the persons in whose names the notes are registered at the close of business on the preceding April 1 and October 1, respectively. We may redeem the 7.00% Notes at any time. The redemption price on the 7.00% Notes is 100% of the principal amount, plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date. Interest on the notes will accrue from the date of issuance and will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. 46 Table of Contents If we undergo a change of control and ratings decline, each as defined in the indenture for the 7.00% Notes, we may be required to repurchase all of the 7.00% Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional interest, if any, to but not including the date of repurchase. The 7.00% Notes rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries. The indenture contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to incur more subsidiary debt or permit subsidiaries to provide guarantees; create liens; and merge, consolidate or sell assets. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that our restricted subsidiaries may incur certain indebtedness, and that we and our subsidiaries may incur liens securing indebtedness, if the aggregate amount of such indebtedness and such liens shall not exceed 3.5x Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the indenture. For more information regarding the 7.00% Notes, please see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements herein. 3.25% Convertible Notes Conversions. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we issued an aggregate of 7,324,760 shares of our Class A common stock upon conversion of approximately $89.5 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture, the holders of the 3.25% Notes are entitled to receive 81.808 shares of Class A common stock for every $1,000 principal amount of notes converted. In connection with the conversion, we paid such holders an aggregate of approximately $3.7 million, calculated based on the accrued and unpaid interest on the notes as of the date of conversion and the discounted value of the future interest payments on the notes. As of December 31, 2007, $18.3 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes remained outstanding. 5.0% Convertible Notes Tender Offer. In February 2007, we conducted a cash tender offer for our outstanding 5.0% Notes. The tender offer was intended to satisfy the rights granted to each noteholder under the indenture for the 5.0% Notes to require us to repurchase on February 20, 2007 all or any part of such holder’s 5.0% Notes at a price equal to the issue price plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to but excluding February 20, 2007. Under the terms of the 5.0% Notes, we had the option to pay for the 5.0% Notes with cash, Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and stock. We elected to pay for the 5.0% Notes solely with cash. Pursuant to the tender offer, we repurchased an aggregate of $192.5 million principal amount of 5.0% Notes for an aggregate of $192.6 million. Upon completion of this tender offer and as of December 31, 2007, $59.7 million principal amount of 5.0% Notes remained outstanding. ATI 7.25% Notes Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation. In April 2007, we commenced a cash tender offer and consent solicitation with respect to our outstanding ATI 7.25% Notes. In May 2007, we received tenders and consents of approximately 99.9% or $324.8 million of the $325.1 million principal amount of ATI 7.25% Notes outstanding, and elected to accept for payment all ATI 7.25% Notes that had been properly tendered and not withdrawn, together with the related consents. Accordingly, we paid $349.5 million, including approximately $10.2 million in accrued and unpaid interest, to holders of ATI 7.25% Notes using net proceeds from the Securitization discussed above. In connection with the tender offer and consent solicitation, we entered into a supplemental indenture effecting certain amendments to the indenture for the notes to eliminate most of the restrictive covenants and certain events of default and to eliminate or modify related provisions. As of December 31, 2007, $0.3 million principal amount of ATI 7.25% Notes remained outstanding. Termination of Interest Rate Swap Agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we received cash of approximately $20.1 million upon net settlement of certain of our assets and liabilities under interest rate swap agreements held as of December 31, 2006 and entered into during the first half of 2007, as discussed below. In addition, we paid $8.0 million related to a treasury rate lock agreement entered into and settled during the three months ended September 30, 2007, as discussed below. We received $3.1 million in cash upon settlement of the assets and liabilities under ten forward starting interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $1.4 billion, which were designated as cash flow hedges to manage exposure to variability in cash flows relating to forecasted interest payments in connection with the Certificates issued in the Securitization in 47 Table of Contents May 2007. As a result, the settlement gain of $2.0 million, net of a tax benefit of $1.1 million, is being recognized as a reduction in interest expense over the five-year period for which the interest rate swaps were designated as hedges. We also received $17.0 million in cash upon settlement of our assets and liabilities under 13 additional interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $850.0 million that managed exposure to variability of interest rates under the SpectraSite credit facilities and AMT OpCo credit facilities. We recognized a net gain on these terminations of $8.1 million, which is included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007. We paid $8.0 million in cash upon settlement of a treasury rate lock agreement with an aggregate notional amount of $250.0 million entered into in anticipation of the issuance of fixed rate debt. We terminated this treasury rate lock agreement during the year ended December 31, 2007 in connection with the pricing of our 7.00% Notes and are recognizing the settlement amount, net of tax as an increase in interest expense over the 10-year term of the 7.00% Notes. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Internally Generated Funds. Because the majority of our tenant leases are multi-year contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of 2007 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it to operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for antenna space on wireless and broadcast communications towers and for related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing towers. Restrictions Under Revolving Credit Facility. The loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility contains certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and all of our subsidiaries designated as restricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens, as well as the following three financial maintenance tests: • a consolidated total leverage ratio (Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than 6.00 to 1.00; • a consolidated senior secured leverage ratio (Senior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than 3.00 to 1.00; and • an interest coverage ratio (Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense) of not less than 2.50 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with each of the foregoing financial tests. The loan agreement also contains reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to timely provide the required information, we would be in breach of these covenants. Any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the facility, but would constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. Restrictions Under Loan Agreement Relating to our Securitization. The loan agreement related to our Securitization includes operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, our two special purpose subsidiaries that are borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. The organizational documents of the borrowers contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities, including the requirement that the borrowers maintain at least two independent directors. The loan agreement also contains certain covenants that require the borrowers to provide the trustee with regular 48 Table of Contents financial reports and operating budgets, promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the loan agreement and other agreements related to the towers subject to the Securitization, and allow the trustee reasonable access to the towers, including the right to conduct site investigations. Failure to comply with the covenants in the loan agreement related to the Securitization could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers, and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of the towers to us. If the borrowers were to default on the loan related to the Securitization, the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the Securitization, in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers. Restrictions Under Notes Indentures. The indentures governing the terms of our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes also contain certain restrictive covenants with which we and the restricted subsidiaries under these indentures must comply. These include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments. With the exception of SpectraSite and its subsidiaries, most of our operating subsidiaries are designated as restricted subsidiaries under these note indentures. In addition, certain of SpectraSite’s subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the amount of cash that they can distribute to us under the loan agreement for the Securitization, as discussed above. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default. Specifically, these indentures restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock unless our consolidated debt is not greater than 7.5 times our adjusted consolidated cash flow. The indentures also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to timely provide the required information, we would be in breach of these covenants. If a default occurred under the loan agreement related to the Securitization, the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility or the indentures for our other debt securities, the maturity dates for our outstanding debt could be accelerated, and we likely would be prohibited from making additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility until we cured the default. If this were to occur, we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. As of December 31, 2007, our annual consolidated cash debt service obligations (principal and interest) for each of the next five years and thereafter are approximately: $252.0 million, $251.4 million, $326.0 million, $267.5 million, $2.1 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. In addition, as a holding company, we depend on distributions from our operating subsidiaries or funds raised through credit facilities and debt and equity offerings to fund our debt obligations. Although the agreements governing the terms of the loan agreement related to the Securitization permit certain of SpectraSite’s subsidiaries to make distributions to us, such terms also significantly limit their ability to distribute cash to us. Accordingly, if we do not receive sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our debt, and there is no assurance we will succeed in such efforts. Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our debt obligations, will depend on our future financial performance, which is subject to many factors beyond our control, as outlined above in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors.” In addition, our ability to raise capital in the future may depend on our credit ratings from commercial rating agencies, which are dependent on our expected financial performance, the liquidity factors discussed above, and the rating agencies’ outlook for our industry. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete such financings or, if such financings are completed, that the terms will be commercially reasonable. 49 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to income taxes, asset retirement obligations, stock-based compensation, impairment of assets, revenue recognition and estimated useful lives of assets. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2007. Of the critical accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, we no longer consider the purchase price allocation as a critical accounting policy or estimate, as the SpectraSite purchase price allocation was finalized in June 2006. As discussed below, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109” (“FIN 48”) as of January 1, 2007, which requires significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position. Changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently, affect our operating results. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Accordingly, we have added additional considerations related to FIN 48 and our state deferred tax valuation allowances in our critical accounting policy related to income taxes, as noted in the following paragraphs. In addition, we have added estimated useful lives of assets as a critical accounting policy for the year ended December 31, 2007. Except for the deletion of the purchase price allocation, adoption of FIN 48 and changes in our deferred state tax valuation allowances, and the addition of estimated useful lives of assets during the year ended December 31, 2007, we have not made any changes to the policies in place at December 31, 2006. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. For a discussion of our other accounting policies, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, beginning on page F-8. • Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, accounting for income taxes in interim periods and income tax disclosures. The cumulative effect of applying this interpretation was recorded as an increase of $25.8 million to accumulated deficit, an increase of $9.2 million to prepaid and other current assets and an increase of $17.1 million to long-term deferred tax assets, with a corresponding increase in other long-term liabilities of $52.1 million in the consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2007. We recognize tax liabilities in accordance with FIN 48, and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. If the tax 50 Table of Contents liabilities relate to tax uncertainties existing at the date of the acquisition of a business, the adjustment of such tax liabilities will result in an adjustment to the goodwill recorded at the date of acquisition. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe. However, based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements, we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions and have classified approximately $29.6 million as other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007. We also classified approximately $30.7 million of accrued income tax-related interest and penalties as other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007. SFAS No. 109 “Accounting For Income Taxes,” requires that companies record a valuation allowance when it is “more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.” We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we completed an analysis of the valuation allowances on our state deferred tax assets. We undertook this analysis as a result of several factors, including the fact that we had experienced several successive quarters of net income, we had restructured certain of our legal entities (primarily related to the Securitization), and we had completed a number of capital raising and debt refinancing transactions during the year ended December 31, 2007. We had previously recorded a full valuation allowance on our net state deferred tax assets, as we considered that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would not be realized. However, upon completion of our analysis during the year ended December 31, 2007, we concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of these net state deferred tax assets would be realized. As a result, we recognized approximately $27.6 million of additional state deferred tax assets (net of a federal tax provision), which were recorded as an income tax benefit and a corresponding increase in long-term deferred income taxes in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007. We will continue to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2007, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $88.2 million, including approximately $33.3 million attributable to SpectraSite, primarily related to certain net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards assumed as of the acquisition date. The balance of the valuation allowance primarily relates to state net operating loss carryforwards, capital losses and foreign items. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as we believe that we will have sufficient time to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty-year tax carryforward period. Valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability. Approximately $12.7 million of the SpectraSite valuation allowances as of December 31, 2007 will be recorded as a reduction to goodwill if the underlying deferred tax assets are utilized. In April 2007, we recovered a portion of our deferred tax asset when we received a federal income tax refund of approximately $65.0 million, plus $15.0 million in interest related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses, as described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. 51 Table of Contents The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $1.3 billion and $1.8 billion in federal and state taxable income, respectively, from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2027. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described above, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our international operations. From time to time, we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations, and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded a $29.5 million income tax provision to reflect a reduction in management’s estimate of the net realizable value of our federal tax refund claims as described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. We believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December 31, 2007. Depending on the resolution of the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings described in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, we may be entitled to a worthless stock or bad debt deduction for our investment in Verestar. We will record any income tax benefit for these potential deductions when the plan of liquidation is finalized and approved by the Bankruptcy Court. • Asset Retirement Obligations. We comply with the provisions of SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” (“SFAS No. 143”) and the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 47 “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations” (“FIN 47”). Both pronouncements address the financial accounting and reporting requirements for conditional obligations associated with our legal obligation to retire tangible long-lived assets and the related asset retirement costs, principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of our tower assets are located. Under these accounting principles, we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made, and we accrete such liability through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. The associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets and depreciated over their estimated useful life. During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net decrease in the estimated obligation of $3.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively. The primary reasons for the decrease in 2007 was a result of changes in timing of certain settlement date assumptions, and the purchase of land underlying ground leases. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we also adopted the provisions of FIN 47 and recognized a $35.5 million charge (net of an $11.7 million tax benefit) as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 primarily resulted in the acceleration of our settlement date assumptions, as FIN 47 precludes us from considering non-contractual lease renewal periods in determining our settlement date assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement 52 Table of Contents obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows, and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense. The significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary. • Stock-Based Compensation. On January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment,” (“SFAS No. 123R”), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options and employee stock purchases under employee stock purchase plans. SFAS No. 123R supersedes the Company’s previous accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB No. 25”). Under SFAS No. 123R, we are no longer permitted to account for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB No. 25 described below. Instead, we are required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and recognize the related expense associated with share-based payments in the statement of operations. We adopted SFAS No. 123R under the modified prospective method, pursuant to which compensation expense for all share-based payments granted or modified after the effective date is recognized based upon the requirements of SFAS No. 123R. Accordingly, prior period amounts have not been restated related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R primarily resulted in a change in our method of measuring and recognizing the fair value of option awards and estimating forfeitures for all unvested awards. SFAS No. 123R requires companies to recognize stock-based compensation awards granted to employees as compensation expense on a fair value method. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service period, which generally represents the vesting period. The expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will be forfeited. Under SFAS No. 123R, the fair value of the stock option is determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the accounting measurement date, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock and its expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. These assumptions are highly subjective and changes in them could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the pro forma compensation expense. Under SFAS No. 123R, the fair value of the stock option is determined in the same manner as the pro forma compensation cost under SFAS No. 123 and adjusted for estimated forfeitures. Under APB No. 25, the Company previously recorded the impact of forfeitures as they occurred. In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) FAS 123R-3, “Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards” (“FAS 123R-3”). Effective upon issuance, this FSP describes an alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool (“APIC pool”) related to the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and the statement of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of SFAS No.123R. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we elected the “Long” method, as defined in the FAS 123R-3. In addition, in accordance with SFAS No. 123R, SFAS No. 109 and EITF Topic D-32, “Intraperiod Tax Allocation of the Tax Effect of Pretax Income from Continuing Operations,” we have elected to recognize excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises in additional paid-in capital only if an incremental income tax benefit would be realized after considering all other tax attributes presently available to us. We measure the tax benefit associated with excess tax deductions related to stock-based compensation expense by multiplying the excess tax deductions by the statutory tax rates. 53 Table of Contents Prior to January 1, 2006, we measured compensation expense for our stock-based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB No. 25. Under the intrinsic value method, compensation expense associated with fixed awards is the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the stock at the accounting measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is measured as of the date an award has received approval by relevant authority, the number of shares and exercise price are fixed and allocation to specific individuals has occurred. Generally, this occurs on the date the grant is approved by the compensation committee of our Board of Directors, or, if grant authority has been delegated to management, when the shares are allocated to specific individuals. The stock-based compensation expense for an award is recognized over the vesting period using the ratable method, whereby an equal amount of expense is recognized for each year of vesting. The actual accounting measurement dates determined in the course of our recent review of our historical stock option granting practices are based on a review of supporting approval documentation and other extrinsic evidence of awards. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we re-evaluated the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options issued to employees and related disclosure of pro forma expense required under SFAS No. 123. As a result, we lowered our expected volatility assumption for options granted after July 1, 2005 to approximately 30% and increased the expected life of option grants to 6.25 years using the simplified method permitted by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107, “Share-Based Payment” (“SAB No. 107”). We made this change based on a number of factors, including our execution of our strategic plans to sell non-core businesses, reduce leverage and our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. We had previously based our volatility assumptions on historical volatility since inception, which included periods when our capital structure was more highly leveraged than current levels and expected levels for the foreseeable future. Our estimate of future volatility is based on our consideration of all available information, including historical volatility, implied volatility of publicly traded options, our current capital structure and our publicly announced future business plans. • Impairment of Assets. Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization and Non-Core Long-Lived Assets Held for Sale: We review long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or our review of our tower portfolio indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Our tower portfolio review includes sites for which we have no current tenant leases and towers for which expenses exceed revenues. We assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows or anticipated proceeds from sales of the assets. If we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset’s fair market value as compared to its carrying value. We record any related impairment losses in the period in which we identify such impairment. We also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based on management’s best estimate of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition. We record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss. Goodwill—Assets Not Subject to Amortization: We perform our annual goodwill impairment test on December 1 of each year and when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. In December 2007, 2006 and 2005, we completed our annual impairment testing related to the goodwill of our rental and management segment and determined that goodwill was not impaired. Fair value estimates are based on our historical and projected operating results and market information, changes to which could affect those fair value estimates. Our December 2007 and 2006 annual impairment testing included approximately $1.6 billion of goodwill acquired in our merger with SpectraSite, Inc. • Revenue Recognition. Rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned, regardless of whether the payments from the customer are 54 Table of Contents received in equal monthly amounts. Fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancelable lease agreements, excluding those tied to the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our customers are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the applicable leases. Straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 approximated $69.7 million, $58.3 million and $30.3 million, respectively. Amounts billed up-front for certain services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases. Amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until such time as the earnings process is complete. • Estimated Useful Lives of Assets. As described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included herein, we are in the process of reviewing the estimated useful lives of our tower assets. We now have over ten years of operating history, and we are considering whether we should modify our current estimates for asset lives based on our historical operating experience. We have retained an independent consultant to assist us in completing this review, and we received a report from the consultant in the first quarter of 2008, which we are in the process of analyzing. We currently depreciate towers on leased land on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the underlying ground lease (including renewal options) or the estimated useful life of the tower, which we have historically estimated to be 15 years. Additionally, certain of our intangible assets are amortized on a similar basis as our tower assets, as the estimated useful lives of such intangibles correlate to the useful life of the towers. If we conclude a revision in the estimated useful lives of our tower assets is appropriate, we will account for any changes in the useful lives as a change in accounting estimate under SFAS No. 154 “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,” which will be recorded prospectively beginning in the period of change. Based on preliminary information obtained to date, we expect that our estimated asset lives may be extended which would result in prospective decreases in depreciation and amortization, and such changes could be material to future depreciation and amortization and our consolidated results of operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”). This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, expands disclosures about fair value measurements and does not require any new fair value measurements. This statement requires quantitative disclosures about fair value measurements for each major category of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis during a period. SFAS No. 157 is effective for us as of January 1, 2008; however in February 2008, the FASB issued a Staff Position that defers the effective date to January 1, 2009 for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements on a recurring basis (that is, at least annually). SFAS No. 157 is still effective for us on January 1, 2008 for financial assets and liabilities. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that SFAS No. 157 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial position, but it is likely that we will be required to provide additional disclosures in financial statements issued after the effective date. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities—Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (“SFAS No. 159”). This statement provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 is effective for us as of January 1, 2008. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that SFAS No. 159 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial position, but it is likely that we will be required to provide additional disclosures in financial statements issued after the effective date. 55 Table of Contents In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS No. 141R”). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141R changes the accounting for acquisitions specifically eliminating the step acquisition model, changes the recognition of contingent consideration from being recognized when it is probable to being recognized at the time of acquisition, disallows the capitalization of transaction costs, changes when restructurings related to acquisitions can be recognized and also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective for us as of January 1, 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 141R will have on acquisitions that are made after the effective date in our consolidated results of operations and financial position. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51” (“SFAS No. 160”). SFAS No. 160 establishes parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent’s ownership interest, and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160 is effective for us as of January 1, 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Information Presented Pursuant to the Indentures of our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes The following table sets forth information that is presented solely to address certain tower cash flow reporting requirements contained in the indentures for our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes. The indentures governing our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes contain restrictive covenants with which we and certain subsidiaries under these indentures must comply. These include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default, which could result in the acceleration of the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest on all our outstanding 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes. In order for the holders of these notes to assess our compliance with certain of these covenants, the indentures require us to disclose in the periodic reports we file with the SEC our Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non-Tower Cash Flow (each as defined in the indentures). Under the indentures, our ability to make certain types of restricted payments is limited by the amount of Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow that we generate, which is determined based on our Tower Cash Flow and Non-Tower Cash Flow. In addition, the indentures for our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock if on a pro forma basis the issuance of such debt and preferred stock would cause our consolidated debt to be greater than 7.5 times our Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow. As of December 31, 2007, the ratio of our consolidated debt to Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow was approximately 3.6. For more information about the restrictions under our notes indentures, see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity.” Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non-Tower Cash Flow are considered non-GAAP financial measures. We are required to provide these financial metrics by the indentures for our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes, and we have included them below because we consider the indentures for these notes to be material agreements, the covenants related to Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non-Tower Cash Flow to be material terms of the indentures, and information about compliance with such covenants to be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity. 56 Table of Contents The following table presents Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non-Tower Cash Flow for the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, as defined in the indentures for the applicable notes (in thousands): Tower Cash Flow, for the three months ended December 31, 2007 $ 177,724 Consolidated Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 $ 668,123 Less: Tower Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 (683,200 ) Plus: four times Tower Cash Flow, for the three months ended December 31, 2007 710,896 Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 $ 695,819 Non-Tower Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 $ (48,012 ) 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long-term debt obligations. We attempt to reduce these risks by utilizing derivative financial instruments, namely interest rate swaps and caps. During the year ended December 31, 2007, all derivative financial instruments were used for purposes other than trading. During 2007, we terminated all swaps and caps that existed at December 31, 2006 and entered into three new interest rate swaps in November 2007. We also entered into and subsequently terminated a treasury lock agreement in connection with the pricing of our 7.00% Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we repurchased or converted $606.8 million face amount of notes for $545.8 million in cash, including the conversion of $89.5 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes and $0.02 million principal amount of 3.00% Notes into shares of our Class A common stock, and the repurchase of $192.5 million principal amount of 5.0% Notes and $324.8 million principal amount of ATI 7.25% Notes. We also repaid and terminated the SpectraSite credit facilities and the AMT OpCo credit facilities in May 2007 and June 2007, respectively. In June 2007, we refinanced our existing $1.6 billion senior secured credit facilities at the AMT OpCo level with the new $1.25 billion Revolving Credit Facility. In August 2007, we entered into a new $500.0 million Term Loan, which was fully drawn in September 2007, and repaid and terminated in October 2007. As of December 31, 2007, $825.0 million was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. The following tables provide information as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates. For long-term debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows by maturity date and average interest rates related to outstanding obligations. For interest rate caps and swaps, the tables present notional principal amounts and weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.

As of December 31, 2007, fixed rate debt consists of: the Certificates issued in the Securitization ($1.75 billion); 2.25% convertible notes due 2009 (“2.25% Notes”) ($0.04 million); the 7.125% Notes ($500.0 million principal amount due at maturity; the balance as of December 31, 2007 is $502.2 million); the 5.0% Notes ($59.7 million); the 3.25% Notes ($18.3 million); the 7.50% Notes ($225.0 million); the ATI 7.25% Notes ($0.3 million); the 3.00% Notes ($345.0 million principal amount due at maturity; the balance as of December 31, 2007 is $344.6 million accreted value); the 7.00% Notes ($500.0 million) and other debt of $60.2 million. Interest on the Revolving Credit Facility is payable in accordance with the applicable London Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2007 for the Revolving Credit Facility was 5.52%. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the weighted average interest rate under our credit facilities was 6.15%. As of December 31, 2006, variable rate debt consists of the SpectraSite credit facilities and AMT OpCo credit facilities ($1,725.0 million drawn) and fixed rate debt consists of: the 2.25% Notes ($0.04 million); the 7.125% Notes ($500.0 million principal amount due at maturity; the balance as of December 31, 2006 is $503.5 million); the 5.0% Notes ($252.2 million); the 3.25% Notes ($107.9 million); the 7.50% Notes ($225.0 million); the ATI 7.25% Notes ($325.1 million); the 3.00% Notes ($345.0 million principal amount due at maturity; the balance as of December 31, 2006 is $344.5 million accreted value) and other debt of $59.8 million. Interest on our credit facilities is payable in accordance with the applicable LIBOR agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2006 for our credit facilities was 5.30%. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the weighted average interest rate under our credit facilities was 5.92%. (b) Includes notional amounts of $150.0 million that expire in December 2009. (c) Represents the weighted-average fixed rate or range of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts in a given year. (d) Includes notional amount of $100.0 million that expires in December 2010. (e) Includes notional amount of $25.0 million that expired in September 2007. (f) Includes notional amounts of $300.0 million that were terminated in June 2007, prior to expiration in December 2009. (g) Includes notional amounts of $550.0 million that were terminated in June 2007, prior to expiration in October 2010. (h) Includes notional amounts of $900.0 million for forward starting interest rate swaps that were terminated in May 2007, prior to expiration in July 2012. Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt under our credit facilities as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements (excluding $900.0 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2006) is comprised of $575.0 million and $875.0 million, respectively. A 10% increase, or approximately 53 basis points, in current interest rates would have caused an additional pre-tax charge to our net income and an increase in our cash outflows of $3.0 million and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 59 Table of Contents In January and February 2008, we entered into an aggregate of five additional interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to variability in cash flows relating to forecasted interest payments under our Revolving Credit Facility. The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of $250.0 million, fixed interest rates ranging from 2.92% to 3.74% and expire in 2011. We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our foreign operations, including our rental and management segment divisions in Mexico and Brazil. We believe the exposure to the effects of foreign currency on our consolidated financial statements is limited as the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the remeasurement gain from these operations approximated $2.7 million and $1.0 million, respectively.",2023-12-30 19:22:48.297638
1053507,AMT,AMERICAN TOWER CORP /MA/,2009,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures in our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” beginning at page 45. Our continuing operations are reported in two segments, rental and management and network development services. Management focuses on segment gross margin and segment operating profit as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments. We define segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization and accretion; selling, general, administrative and development expense; and impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense. We define segment operating profit as segment gross margin less selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. Segment gross margin and segment operating profit for the rental and management segment also include interest income, TV Azteca, net (see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included herein). These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before interest income, interest expense, loss on retirement of long-term obligations, other income (expense), minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries, income on equity method investments, income taxes and discontinued operations. Executive Overview Our principal operating segment is our rental and management segment, which accounted for approximately 97% and 98% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and approximately 99% of our segment operating profit in both years. The primary factors affecting the stability and growth of our revenues and cash flows for this segment are our recurring revenues from existing tenant leases and the contractual escalators in those leases, leasing additional space on our existing towers, acquiring and building additional tower sites and the degree to which any of our existing customer leases are cancelled. We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to utilize existing tower capacity. In addition, we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from customers providing wireless broadband-services. The majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are for an initial non-cancelable term of five to ten years, with multiple five-year renewal terms thereafter. Accordingly, nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of December 2008 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. In addition, most of our leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease. These contractual escalators are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage (generally three to five percent), inflation, or a fixed percentage plus inflation. Revenue generated by rate increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable term of the applicable agreement. We also routinely seek to extend our tenant leases with our customers, which has the effect of increasing the non-cancelable term of the agreement and creating additional stability for our revenues and cash flows. The revenues generated by our rental and management segment also may be affected by cancellations of existing customer leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multi-year contracts, which typically may not be cancelled or, in some instances, may be cancelled only upon payment of a termination fee. Accordingly, lease cancellations historically have not had a material adverse effect 27 Table of Contents on the revenues generated by our rental and management segment. During the year ended December 31, 2008, tenant leases representing less than 2% of our rental and management revenues were cancelled. A significant majority of our revenue growth in the year ended December 31, 2008 was attributable to incremental revenue generated by our existing communications sites. During 2008, incremental revenue attributable to those sites that existed during the entire period between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2008, was approximately $95.3 million, which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites, contractual escalators, net of straight-line accounting treatment, and the net increase in straight-line revenue from extending the renewal dates of thousands of our tenant leases, partially offset by lease cancellations. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and, to a lesser extent, the location of and available capacity on our existing sites. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure needs, the financial performance of our customers and their access to capital, and general economic conditions. We believe leasing additional space on our existing sites will contribute the substantial majority of our year-over-year revenue growth in 2009. We also generate revenues by building and acquiring new communications sites. We constructed or acquired 961 and 462 sites in the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Because of the nature of our recurring revenues described above, our results of operations only reflect revenues generated on these sites following the respective dates of their construction or acquisition, which affects year-over-year comparisons. During 2008, incremental revenue attributable to the approximately 1,420 sites that were built or acquired between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2008, was approximately $25.7 million. Our rental and management segment operating expenses include our direct tower level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and utilities. These segment level expenses exclude all segment and corporate, selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling, general, administrative and development expense. Our segment level selling, general, administrative and development expenses consist of expenses to support our rental and management and network development services segments, such as sales and property management functions. In general, our segment level selling, general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites and increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing space to new customers on our existing sites provides significant incremental cash flow. Our profit margin growth is, therefore, directly related to the number of new tenants added to our existing tower sites and the related rental revenue generated in a particular period. 28 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 Year EndedDecember 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2008 2007 (In thousands) REVENUES: Rental and management $ 1,547,035 $ 1,425,975 $ 121,060 8 % Network development services 46,469 30,619 15,850 52 Total revenues 1,593,504 1,456,594 136,910 9 OPERATING EXPENSES: Costs of operations (exclusive of items shown separately below) Rental and management 363,024 343,450 19,574 6 Network development services 26,831 16,172 10,659 66 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 405,332 522,928 (117,596 ) (22 ) Selling, general, administrative and development expense (including $54,807 and $54,603 of stock-based compensation expense, respectively) 180,374 186,483 (6,109 ) (3 ) Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense 11,189 9,198 1,991 22 Total operating expenses 986,750 1,078,231 (91,481 ) (8 ) OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE): Interest income, TV Azteca, net of interest expense $1,489 and $1,490 14,253 14,207 46 Interest income 3,413 10,848 (7,435 ) (69 ) Interest expense (253,584 ) (235,824 ) 17,760 8 Loss on retirement of long-term obligations (4,904 ) (35,429 ) (30,525 ) (86 ) Other income 5,988 20,675 (14,687 ) (71 ) Income tax provision (135,509 ) (59,809 ) 75,700 127 Minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries (169 ) (338 ) (169 ) (50 ) Income on equity method investments 22 19 3 16 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net 110,982 (36,396 ) 147,378 405 Net income $ 347,246 $ 56,316 $ 290,930 517 % Total Revenues Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $1,593.5 million, an increase of $136.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $121.1 million of the increase was attributable to an increase in rental and management revenue. The balance of the increase resulted from an increase in network development services revenue of $15.9 million. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $1,547.0 million, an increase of $121.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $95.3 million of the increase resulted from incremental revenue generated by communications sites that existed during the entire period between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2008, which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites, 29 Table of Contents existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites, contractual escalators, net of straight-line accounting treatment, and the net increase in straight-line revenue from extending the renewal dates of thousands of our tenant leases, partially offset by lease cancellations. Approximately $25.7 million of the increase resulted from approximately 1,420 communications sites acquired and/or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2007. We believe that our rental and management revenue will grow as we continue to utilize existing site capacity. We anticipate that the majority of our new leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $46.5 million, an increase of $15.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to revenues generated from our site acquisition, zoning and permitting services. As we continue to focus on and grow our rental and management business, however, we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $986.8 million, a decrease of approximately $91.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was attributable to decreases in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense and selling, general, administrative and development expense of $117.6 million and $6.1 million, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses within our rental and management segment of $19.6 million, an increase in expenses within our network development services segment of $10.7 million and an increase in impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense of $2.0 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Gross Margin/Segment Operating Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $363.0 million, an increase of $19.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $10.4 million of the increase was attributable to communications sites which existed during the period between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2008, and approximately $9.2 million of the increase was related to approximately 1,420 sites acquired and/or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2007. The increase in expenses related to existing towers as of January 1, 2007 resulted primarily from increases in ground rent. Rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $1,198.3 million, an increase of $101.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase resulted from the additional rental and management revenue described above, partially offset by the increase in rental and management expense. Rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $1,130.2 million, an increase of $99.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. This was comprised of the $101.5 million increase in rental and management segment gross margin described above, net of an increase of $2.2 million in selling, general, administrative and development expenses related to the rental and management segment. Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $26.8 million, an increase of $10.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The majority of the increase correlates to the growth in services performed as noted above. 30 Table of Contents Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $405.3 million, a decrease of $117.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily due to our revision of the estimated useful lives of our towers and certain related intangible assets from our historical estimate of 15 years to a revised estimate of 20 years, partially offset by the depreciation, amortization and accretion expense associated with newly acquired and constructed towers. The change in the estimated useful lives of our towers was based on a review that we completed in the first quarter of 2008, the effect of which was accounted for prospectively effective January 1, 2008, which resulted in a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $121.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense Selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $180.4 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately $12.8 million in costs associated with the legal and governmental proceedings related to the review of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting, and other related costs, partially offset by increases of approximately $6.7 million in expenses associated with international business development and information technology spending. Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long-lived Assets, Restructuring and Merger Related Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $11.2 million, an increase of $2.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily due to a $1.4 million increase in losses recognized upon the disposal of certain non-core tower assets. Interest Income Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $3.4 million, a decrease of $7.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in average interest rates from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $253.6 million, an increase of $17.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to an approximately 13% increase in our average outstanding debt, as a result of the debt financing activities described in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below and note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included herein, partially offset by a decrease in the average borrowing rate. Loss on Retirement of Long-Term Obligations Loss on retirement of long-term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $4.9 million, a decrease of $30.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2008, holders of approximately $18.3 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes and $182.8 million principal amount of our 3.00% Notes converted their notes into shares of our Common Stock. In connection with conversions of a portion of these notes, we paid holders an aggregate of approximately $4.9 million, calculated based on the discounted value of the future interest payments on their notes. During the year ended December 31, 2007, holders of approximately $89.5 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes converted their notes into shares of our Common Stock, and we repurchased pursuant to tender 31 Table of Contents offers approximately $192.5 million principal amount of our 5.0% convertible notes due 2010 (“5.0% Notes”) and $324.8 million principal amount of our ATI 7.25% senior subordinated notes due 2011 (“ATI 7.25% Notes”). We also repaid all amounts outstanding under the credit facilities of SpectraSite and at the American Tower operating company level, and we terminated all commitments thereunder. In addition, we repaid all amounts outstanding under our $500.0 million senior unsecured term loan credit facility and terminated the loan. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a charge of $35.4 million related to amounts paid in excess of the carrying value of our 5.0% Notes and ATI 7.25% Notes, amounts paid to holders of our 3.25% Notes in connection with their note conversions, and the write-off of related deferred financing fees. For more information regarding our financing activities, see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash Flows from Financing Activities” below. Other Income Other income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $6.0 million, a decrease of $14.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2008, consisted primarily of foreign currency gains of $5.7 million. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2007 consisted primarily of approximately $18.0 million of gains from the sale of available-for-sale securities and the mark-to-market and subsequent settlement of interest rate swap agreements. Income Tax Provision The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $135.5 million, as compared to $59.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, representing an increase of $75.7 million from the prior year period. The effective tax rate was 36.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to 39.1% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the income tax provision correlates to the increase in income during the year ended December 31, 2008 as noted above. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign currency gains, the reversal of $6.4 million of valuation allowances related to our Mexican subsidiary and state taxes. These items are described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included herein. Other differences from the federal statutory rate include other foreign items, settlement of tax reserves, non-deductible stock-based compensation expense and additional tax reserves. In the year ended December 31, 2007, we recovered a portion of our deferred tax asset through our federal income tax refund claims related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses. In June 2003 and October 2003, we filed federal income tax refund claims with the IRS relating to the carry back of $380.0 million of net operating losses generated prior to 2003. In April 2007, we received a refund of approximately $65.0 million, plus $15.0 million in interest, substantially all of which was accrued at March 31, 2007. Income (Loss) From Discontinued Operations, Net Income from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $111.0 million, as compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $36.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded an income tax benefit related to losses associated with our investment in our wholly owned subsidiary, Verestar, Inc. (“Verestar”). Verestar filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in December 2003. During 2007, we settled litigation related to the Verestar bankruptcy. In April 2008, the bankruptcy court approved Verestar’s plan of liquidation and in December 2008, Verestar was liquidated. As a result, we recorded an income tax benefit of $110.1 million related to losses associated with our investment in Verestar as income from discontinued operations during the 32 Table of Contents year ended December 31, 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a $32.0 million liability associated with the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings equal to the settlement amount, which we paid in November 2007.

The balance of the increase resulted from an increase in network development services revenue of $7.3 million. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $1,426.0 million, an increase of $131.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $118.3 million of the increase resulted 33 Table of Contents from incremental revenue generated by communications sites that existed during the entire period between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2007, which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites, contractual escalators, net of straight-line accounting treatment, favorable currency exchange rates and the net increase in straight-line revenue from extending the renewal dates of thousands of our tenant leases, partially offset by lease cancellations. Approximately $13.6 million of the increase resulted from approximately 790 communications sites acquired and/or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2006. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $30.6 million, an increase of $7.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to revenues generated by our structural analysis services, related in part to our January 2007 acquisition of a structural analysis engineering firm, which enabled us to increase our structural analysis capabilities. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $1,078.2 million, an increase of $44.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was attributable to an increase in selling, general, administrative and development expense of $27.2 million, an increase in expenses within our rental and management segment of $11.2 million, an increase in expenses within our network development services segment of $4.9 million and an increase in impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense of $6.6 million. These increases were offset by a decrease in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense of $5.1 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Gross Margin/Segment Operating Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $343.5 million, an increase of $11.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $7.5 million of the increase was attributable to communications sites which existed during the period between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2007, and approximately $3.7 million of the increase was related to approximately 790 sites acquired and/or constructed subsequent to January 1, 2006. The increase in expenses related to existing towers as of January 1, 2006 resulted primarily from increases in ground rent. Rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $1,096.7 million, an increase of $120.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase resulted from the additional rental and management revenue described above, partially offset by the increase in rental and management expense. Rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $1,030.8 million, an increase of $115.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. This was comprised of the $120.7 million increase in rental and management segment gross margin described above, net of an increase of $4.8 million in selling, general, administrative and development expenses related to the rental and management segment. Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $16.2 million, an increase of $4.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The majority of the increase correlates to the growth in services performed as noted above. 34 Table of Contents Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $522.9 million, a decrease of $5.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease was primarily attributable to the finalization in June 2006 of the purchase price allocation related to long-lived assets acquired in connection with the SpectraSite merger, which resulted in decreases in the fair values of certain intangible assets and changes in the estimated useful lives of certain tangible and intangible assets. Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense Selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $186.5 million, an increase of $27.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $15.1 million in stock-based compensation expense and a decrease of $2.3 million in costs associated with the legal and governmental proceedings related to the review of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting, and other related costs. Stock-based compensation expense included $7.6 million related to the modification of certain stock option awards for two members of senior management who terminated their employment during the year ended December 31, 2007. The remaining $14.4 million net increase was primarily the result of increases in employee compensation expenses other than stock-based compensation expense, primarily related to administrative, information technology and business development activities. Impairments, Net Loss on Sale of Long-lived Assets, Restructuring and Merger Related Expense Impairments, net loss on sale of long-lived assets, restructuring and merger related expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $9.2 million, an increase of $6.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to a $3.1 million increase in impairments and net loss on sale of long-lived assets. Interest Income Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $10.8 million, an increase of $1.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in average interest-earning cash balances. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $235.8 million, an increase of $20.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to an approximately 9% increase in our average outstanding debt, as a result of the debt financing activities undertaken during the period. Loss on Retirement of Long-Term Obligations During the year ended December 31, 2007, approximately $89.5 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes were converted into shares of our Common Stock, and we repurchased pursuant to tender offers approximately $192.5 million principal amount of our 5.0% Notes and $324.8 million principal amount of our ATI 7.25% Notes. We also repaid all amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities of SpectraSite and at the American Tower operating company level, and we terminated all commitments thereunder. In addition, we repaid all amounts outstanding under our $500.0 million senior unsecured term loan credit facility and terminated the loan. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a charge of $35.4 million related to amounts paid in excess of the carrying value and the write-off of related deferred financing fees. 35 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately $45.0 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes were converted into shares of our Common Stock, and we repurchased approximately $74.9 million principal amount of our ATI 7.25% Notes and $23.5 million principal amount of our 5.0% Notes. In addition, on February 1, 2006, we redeemed $227.7 million aggregate principal amount ($162.1 million accreted value, net of $7.0 million fair value discount allocated to warrants) of our ATI 12.25% senior subordinated discount notes due 2008 in accordance with the indenture at 106.125% of their accreted value for an aggregate of $179.5 million. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a charge of $27.2 million related to amounts paid in excess of the carrying value and the write-off of related deferred financing fees. Other Income Other income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $20.7 million, an increase of $14.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $5.5 million of gains recognized on the sale of our common stock investment in FiberTower Corporation and an increase of $6.2 million in gains recognized from the mark to market and subsequent settlement of certain interest rate swap agreements. Income Tax Provision The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $59.8 million, as compared to $41.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, representing an increase of $18.0 million from the prior year period. The effective tax rate was 39.1% for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 58.9% for the year ended December 31, 2006. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the reversal of $27.6 million of valuation allowances on net state deferred tax assets offset by a $7.6 million deferred tax liability recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2007 related to unrealized foreign currency gains on intercompany loans with our Brazilian subsidiary. These items are described in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included herein. Other differences from the federal statutory rate include other foreign items, settlement of tax reserves, non-deductible stock-based compensation expense, additional tax reserves and state taxes. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to foreign items, non-deductible losses on conversions of our 3.25% Notes and state taxes. In the year ended December 31, 2007, we also received a federal income tax refund from the IRS of approximately $65.0 million, plus $15.0 million in interest. The refund resulted from claims by us filed with the IRS in June 2003 and October 2003, which related to the carry back of net operating losses. During the three months ended December 31, 2007, we recorded adjustments to the income tax provision for amounts that should have been recorded in prior reporting periods. The adjustments were identified in connection with our year-end tax analyses and audit of the consolidated financial statements and relate primarily to our cumulative deferred tax assets and liabilities. Recording these out-of-period adjustments for the three months ended December 31, 2007 had the effect of increasing the income tax provision by $7.9 million and decreasing income from continuing operations by approximately $4.8 million (inclusive of certain non-tax related adjustments). Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net The loss from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December 31, 2007 included $37.8 million of net losses related to Verestar and $1.4 million in net gains related to litigation and insurance settlements that were settled for less than the original estimates. 36 Table of Contents The loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 is primarily due to the settlement of the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings and related litigation and the related tax effects. In November 2007, following approval by the bankruptcy court, the Verestar settlement agreement became effective, we paid the $32.0 million settlement amount and the litigation was dismissed. In connection with the approval of the settlement agreement by the bankruptcy court and the dismissal of the bankruptcy proceedings and related litigation, we determined that the benefits from certain of Verestar’s net operating losses would more likely than not be recoverable by us. We had not previously recorded these tax benefits related to net operating losses generated from the operations of Verestar and used by us because our ability to realize such benefits was potentially impacted by the bankruptcy proceedings and related litigation that had yet to be resolved. Accordingly, in November 2007, we recorded $5.6 million of additional tax benefits related to Verestar. We also recorded a tax provision of $10.7 million in loss from discontinued operations, net during the three months ended December 31, 2007 to write off deferred tax assets associated with Verestar that should have been written off in 2002 and removed from the consolidated balance sheet when Verestar was deconsolidated upon its bankruptcy filing in December 2003. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview As a holding company, our cash flows are derived primarily from the operations of and distributions from our operating subsidiaries or funds raised through borrowings under our credit facilities and debt and equity offerings. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $638.2 million of total liquidity, comprised of approximately $143.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to borrow approximately $495.1 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2008, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $110.0 million as compared to December 31, 2007. Summary cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is set forth below. Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 773,258 $ 692,679 $ 620,738 Investing activities (274,940 ) (186,180 ) (129,112 ) Financing activities (388,172 ) (754,640 ) (323,063 ) Net effect of changes in exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (192 ) — — Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 109,954 $ (248,141 ) $ 168,563 We use our cash flows to fund our operations and investments in our business, including tower maintenance and improvements, tower construction and DAS network installations, and tower and land acquisitions. During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we also used a significant amount of our cash flows to fund refinancing and repurchases of our outstanding indebtedness, as well as our stock repurchase programs. By refinancing and repurchasing a portion of our outstanding indebtedness, we improved our financial position, which increased our financial flexibility and our ability to return value to our stockholders. Our significant transactions in 2008 included the following: • We entered into a new $325.0 million Term Loan pursuant to our Revolving Credit Facility and used the net proceeds, together with available cash, to repay $325.0 million of existing indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. • We reduced the amount of indebtedness outstanding under our convertible notes through conversions of approximately $201.1 million face amount of convertible notes into shares of our Common Stock. 37 Table of Contents • We repurchased approximately 18.3 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $697.1 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to our stock repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2008, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $4.3 billion. We generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and cash interest obligations in 2008. We believe our cash generated by operations for the year ending December 31, 2009 also will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and our cash debt service (interest and principal repayments) obligations for 2009. During 2009, if the financial and credit markets improve, we expect that we may opportunistically raise additional capital to fund stock repurchases, repurchase existing debt and for other general corporate purposes. Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2008, cash provided by operating activities was $773.3 million, an increase of approximately $80.6 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in income from continuing operations of $143.5 million resulting from continued growth in our rental and management segment. For the year ended December 31, 2007, cash provided by operating activities was $692.7 million, an increase of approximately $71.9 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net income of $28.8 million resulting from the continued growth of our rental and management segment and a decrease in prepaid and other assets, which was partially offset by a decrease in non-cash items reflected in the statement of operations. The decrease in prepaid and other assets was primarily the result of a decrease in deferred tax assets. The decrease in non-cash items was primarily a result of a reduction of approximately $49.8 million of net cash receipts related to towers included in the securitization transaction, which are classified as restricted cash. Each of our rental and management and network development services segments are expected to generate cash flows from operations during 2009 in excess of their cash needs for operations and expenditures for tower construction, improvements and acquisitions. Cash Flows from Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2008 cash used for investing activities was $274.9 million, an increase of approximately $88.8 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to increased spending for the purchase of property and equipment and construction activities and acquisitions of approximately $89.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008, payments for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities totaled $243.5 million, including $105.5 million of capital expenditures related to the maintenance, improvement and augmentation of our existing communications sites, $90.7 million spent in connection with the construction of 676 towers and the installation of 16 in-building DAS networks, $41.7 million spent to acquire land under our towers that was subject to ground agreements (including leases), and $5.6 million spent on information technology improvements. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, we spent $42.8 million to acquire 269 towers. We plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria. Accordingly, we may continue to acquire communications sites, acquire land under our towers, build or install new communications sites and redevelop or improve existing communications sites when the expected returns on such investments meet our return on investment criteria. We expect that our 2009 total capital expenditures will be between approximately $200.0 million and $230.0 million, including $45.0 million for capital improvements and corporate expenditures, 38 Table of Contents between $30.0 million and $35.0 million for the redevelopment of existing communications sites, between $25.0 million and $30.0 million of ground lease purchases and between $100.0 million and $120.0 million for the construction of approximately 700 to 900 new communications sites, including towers and DAS networks, and for the installation of shared back-up power generators at certain of our tower sites. For the year ended December 31, 2007, cash used for investing activities was $186.2 million, an increase of approximately $57.1 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily attributable to increased spending for the purchase of property and equipment and construction activities and acquisitions of approximately $56.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2007, payments for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities totaled $154.4 million, including $66.5 million of capital expenditures related to the maintenance, improvement and augmentation of our existing communications sites, $30.7 million spent in connection with the construction of 152 towers and the installation of 17 in-building DAS networks, $44.4 million spent to acquire land under our towers that was subject to ground agreements (including leases), and $12.7 million spent on information technology improvements. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2007, we spent $36.9 million to acquire 293 towers and $7.1 million to acquire the assets of a structural analysis engineering firm. Cash Flows from Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2008, cash used for financing activities was $388.2 million, a decrease of approximately $366.5 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately $928.2 million in purchases of our Common Stock and a decrease of $44.7 million in deferred financing costs and other financing activities. These decreases were partially offset by the absence of any new debt issuances during the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the issuance of approximately $2,250.0 million in debt during the year ended December 31, 2007. Borrowings under our credit facilities during the year ended December 31, 2008 were approximately $575.0 million, as compared to $2,175.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. The borrowings and debt issuances were offset by debt repayments of approximately $327.5 million and $3,612.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2007, cash used for financing activities was $754.6 million, an increase of approximately $431.6 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately $3,316.5 million in repayments of notes payable, credit facilities and capital leases and an increase of $1,336.0 million in purchases of our Common Stock, partially offset by an increase of $4,183.0 million in the proceeds received as a result of the issuance of debt and drawdown on the existing credit facilities. Revolving Credit Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we drew down and repaid amounts under the $1.25 billion Revolving Credit Facility in the ordinary course, and we also repaid $325.0 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility using net proceeds from the Term Loan and available cash. As of December 31, 2008, we had $750.0 million outstanding and the ability to borrow approximately $495.1 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility is American Tower Corporation. The Revolving Credit Facility has a term of five years and matures on June 8, 2012. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The Revolving Credit Facility does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. The Revolving Credit Facility allows us to use borrowings for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes of us and our subsidiaries (including, without limitation, to refinance or repurchase other indebtedness and, provided certain conditions are met, to repurchase our equity securities, in each case without additional lender approval). 39 Table of Contents Term Loan. On March 24, 2008, we entered into the $325.0 million Term Loan pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility. At closing, we received net proceeds of approximately $321.7 million from the Term Loan, which, together with available cash, we used to repay $325.0 million of existing indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Term Loan is governed by the terms of the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility. Consistent with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, the borrower under the Term Loan is American Tower Corporation, and the maturity date for the Term Loan is June 8, 2012. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The Term Loan does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. Stock Repurchase Programs. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we maintained two stock repurchase programs, a $1.5 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February 2007 (“2007 Buyback”), which we ended in February 2008, and a $1.5 billion stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in February 2008 (“2008 Buyback”), which remains ongoing. Pursuant to the 2007 Buyback we repurchased 4.3 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate of $163.7 million, including commissions and fees, during the three months ended March 31, 2008. Total repurchases under the 2007 Buyback were approximately 35.3 million shares of Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1.45 billion, including commissions and fees. Pursuant to the 2008 Buyback, we repurchased 14.0 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate of $533.3 million, including commissions and fees, during the year ended December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, we had repurchased a total of 71.1 million shares of Common Stock for an aggregate of $2.7 billion, including commissions and fees, pursuant to our stock repurchase programs. In the near term, we expect to fund any further repurchases of our Common Stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. If the financial and credit markets improve, we expect that we may opportunistically raise additional capital, which we could then use to fund future purchases of our Common Stock. Purchases under the 2008 Buyback are subject to us having available cash to fund repurchases. Under the 2008 Buyback, we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. To facilitate repurchases, we purchase our Common Stock pursuant to trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, which allow us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we significantly reduced purchases of Common Stock under our stock repurchase program based on the downturn in the economy and the disruptions in the financial and credit markets. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, we repurchased approximately 28,000 shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate of $0.8 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the 2008 Buyback. As of February 13, 2009, we had repurchased a total of 14.0 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate of $534.1 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the 2008 Buyback. We expect to continue to manage the pacing of the program in the future in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors. Sales of Equity Securities. We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plans and upon exercise of warrants to purchase our equity securities. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we received an aggregate of approximately $82.9 million in proceeds from sales of shares pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, upon exercises of stock options and upon exercises of warrants. 40 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations. Our contractual obligations relate primarily to the Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-1 issued in our securitization transaction, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan, our outstanding notes and our operating leases related to the ground under our towers. The following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations payable in cash as of December 31, 2008 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-1 $ 1,750,000 $ 1,750,000 Revolving Credit Facility(1) $ 750,000 750,000 Term Loan (1) 325,000 325,000 7.25% senior subordinated notes $ 288 288 7.50% senior notes 225,000 225,000 7.125% senior notes 500,000 500,000 7.00% senior notes 500,000 500,000 5.0% convertible notes $ 59,683 59,683 3.00% convertible notes(2) 162,216 162,216 2.25% convertible notes $ 44 44 Long-term obligations, excluding capital leases and other notes payable $ 44 $ 59,683 $ 288 $ 1,962,216 $ 2,250,000 $ 4,272,231 Cash interest expense(1) 224,000 218,000 217,000 182,000 $ 133,000 158,000 1,132,000 Capital lease payments (including interest) and other notes payable 5,772 5,469 4,972 4,812 4,829 206,570 232,424 Total debt service obligations $ 229,816 $ 283,152 $ 222,260 $ 2,149,028 $ 137,829 $ 2,614,570 $ 5,636,655 Operating lease payments(3) 229,799 222,063 217,771 212,871 207,771 2,859,415 3,949,690 Other long-term liabilities(4)(5) 164 182 187 193 198 214,873 215,797 Total $ 459,779 $ 505,397 $ 440,218 $ 2,362,092 $ 345,798 $ 5,688,858 $ 9,802,142 (1) The Company has the option of choosing either a defined base rate or the London Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) as the applicable base interest rate for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan. For the Revolving Credit Facility, the interest rate ranges between 0.40% and 1.25% above the applicable LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.00% and 0.25% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on our debt ratings. For the Term Loan, the interest rate ranges between 0.50% and 1.50% above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.00% and 0.50% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on our debt ratings. A quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the Revolving Credit Facility is required, ranging from 0.08% to 0.25% per annum, based on our debt ratings. As discussed in Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” we have entered into swap agreements to manage exposure to variable rate interest obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan. As a result of these swap agreements, the effective weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2008 for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan was 3.20%. For projections of our cash interest expense related to the 41 Table of Contents Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan, we have assumed the LIBOR rate before the margin, as defined in the loan agreement, is 1.42% through its maturity on June 7, 2012. (2) We may redeem the 3.00% Notes after August 20, 2009 at an initial redemption price of 101.125% of the principal amount, subject to a ratable decline after August 15 of the following year to 100% of the principal amount in 2012. (3) Operating lease payments include payments to be made under non-cancelable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable tower site and related revenues from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that we will renew the lease. (4) Primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other long-term liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily our straight-line rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash. (5) Other long-term liabilities exclude $24.7 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and $29.1 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled. Settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe. However, based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements, we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Refinancing Activities In order to extend the maturity dates of our indebtedness, lower our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance our outstanding indebtedness. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we entered into a $325.0 million Term Loan pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility, and we used the net proceeds, together with available cash, to repay $325.0 million of existing indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility, as discussed above. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we also reduced the amount of indebtedness outstanding under our convertible notes through conversions of notes into shares of our Common Stock, and we sought to manage our exposure to variable interest rates under our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan by entering into swap agreements, as discussed below. 3.25% Convertible Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we issued approximately 1.5 million shares of our Common Stock upon conversion of approximately $18.3 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture, holders of the 3.25% Notes are entitled to receive 81.808 shares of Common Stock for every $1,000 principal amount of notes converted. In April 2008, we issued approximately 1.1 million shares of our Common Stock upon conversion of approximately $13.6 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes. In connection with the conversion, we paid the holders an aggregate of approximately $0.2 million, calculated based on the accrued and unpaid interest on the notes and the discounted value of the future interest payments on the notes. In July 2008, we issued a notice for the redemption on August 6, 2008 of all of our outstanding 3.25% Notes. In accordance with the conversion provisions of the 3.25% Notes and the indenture for the 3.25% Notes, holders of the notes had the right at any time until and including, but not after, the close of business on August 5, 2008, to convert their notes into shares of our Common Stock. Holders of all $4.7 million of the outstanding 3.25% Notes converted their notes into an aggregate of approximately 0.4 million shares of our Common Stock prior to redemption. As a result, as of August 6, 2008, none of the 3.25% Notes remained outstanding. 42 Table of Contents 3.00% Convertible Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we issued 8.9 million shares of our Common Stock upon conversion of approximately $182.8 million principal amount of our 3.00% Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture, holders of the 3.00% Notes are entitled to receive 48.7805 shares of Common Stock for every $1,000 principal amount of notes converted. In connection with the conversions, we paid such holders an aggregate of approximately $4.7 million, calculated based on the discounted value of the future interest payments on the notes. As of December 31, 2008, $162.2 million principal amount of the 3.00% Notes remained outstanding. Interest Rate Swap Agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we entered into twelve additional interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to variability in cash flows related to forecasted interest payments under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan. As of December 31, 2008, we held fifteen interest rate swap agreements, all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges, and which have an aggregate notional amount of $775.0 million, interest rates ranging from 2.86% to 4.08% and expiration dates through March 2011. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Internally Generated Funds. Because the majority of our tenant leases are multi-year contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of 2008 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites. Restrictions Under Loan Agreement Relating to Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan. The loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan contains certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and all of our subsidiaries designated as restricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens, as well as the following three financial maintenance tests: • a consolidated total leverage ratio (Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than 6.00 to 1.00; • a consolidated senior secured leverage ratio (Senior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than 3.00 to 1.00; and • an interest coverage ratio (Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense) of not less than 2.50 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with each of the foregoing financial tests. The loan agreement also contains reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to timely provide the required information, we would be in breach of these covenants. Any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the facility, but would constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. Restrictions Under Loan Agreement Relating to Securitization Transaction. The loan agreement related to the securitization transaction includes operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, our two special purpose subsidiaries that are borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. The organizational documents of the borrowers contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special 43 Table of Contents purpose entities, including the requirement that the borrowers maintain at least two independent directors. The loan agreement also contains certain covenants that require the borrowers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets, promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the loan agreement and other agreements related to the towers subject to the securitization transaction, and allow the trustee reasonable access to the towers, including the right to conduct site investigations. Failure to comply with the covenants in the loan agreement related to the securitization transaction could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers, and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of the towers to us. If the borrowers were to default on the loan related to the securitization transaction, the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the securitization transaction, in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers. Restrictions Under Notes Indentures. The indentures governing the terms of our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes also contain certain restrictive covenants with which we and the restricted subsidiaries under these indentures must comply. These include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments. With the exception of SpectraSite and its subsidiaries, most of our operating subsidiaries are designated as restricted subsidiaries under these note indentures. This means, among other things, that those subsidiaries, like American Tower Corporation itself, are subject to those indentures’ restrictions on the amount of cash that they can distribute to unrestricted subsidiaries or otherwise pay out of the restricted group. In addition, certain of SpectraSite’s subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the amount of cash that they can distribute to us under the loan agreement for the securitization transaction, as discussed above. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default. Specifically, these indentures restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock unless our consolidated debt is not greater than 7.5 times our adjusted consolidated cash flow. The indentures also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to timely provide the required information, we would be in breach of these covenants. If a default occurred under the loan agreement related to the securitization transaction, the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan or the indentures for our other debt securities, the maturity dates for our outstanding debt could be accelerated, and we likely would be prohibited from making additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility until we cured the default. If this were to occur, we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. As of December 31, 2008, our annual consolidated cash debt service obligations (principal and interest) for each of the next five years and thereafter are approximately: $229.8 million, $283.2 million, $222.3 million, $2.2 billion, $137.8 million and $2.6 billion, respectively. In addition, as a holding company, we depend on distributions from our operating subsidiaries or funds raised through credit facilities and debt and equity offerings to fund our debt obligations. Although the agreements governing the terms of the loan agreement related to the securitization transaction permit certain of SpectraSite’s subsidiaries to make distributions to us, such terms also significantly limit their ability to distribute cash to us. Accordingly, if we do not receive sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our debt, and there is no assurance we will succeed in such efforts. Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance, which is subject to many factors beyond our control, as outlined above in Item 1A 44 Table of Contents of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors.” In addition, our ability to raise capital in the future may depend on our credit ratings from commercial rating agencies, which are dependent on our expected financial performance, the liquidity factors discussed above, and the rating agencies’ outlook for our industry. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete such financings or, if such financings are completed, that the terms will be commercially reasonable, particularly in light of the recent downturn in the economy and the disruptions in the financial and credit markets. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to income taxes, asset retirement obligations, stock-based compensation, impairment of assets, revenue recognition and estimated useful lives of assets. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2008. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. For a discussion of our other accounting policies, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, beginning on page F-7. • Income Taxes. We recognize tax liabilities in accordance with FIN 48, and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe, or if the applicable statute of limitations lapses. We believe that the amount of the change could range from zero to $10.0 million. As of December 31, 2008, we have classified approximately $24.7 million as other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. We also classified approximately $29.1 million of accrued income tax-related interest and penalties as other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008. SFAS No. 109 “Accounting For Income Taxes,” requires that companies record a valuation allowance when it is “more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.” We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2008, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $47.4 million which primarily relates to state net operating loss carryforwards, equity investments and foreign items. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as we believe that we will have sufficient taxable income to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty-year tax 45 Table of Contents carryforward period. Valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion in federal and state taxable income, respectively, from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2028. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described above, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our international operations. From time to time, we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations, and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. We believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December 31, 2008. As described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in April 2008, Verestar’s plan of liquidation was approved by the bankruptcy court and in December 2008, Verestar was liquidated. As a result, we recorded an income tax benefit of $110.1 million related to losses associated with our investment in Verestar as income from discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2008. • Asset Retirement Obligations. We comply with the provisions of SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” (“SFAS No. 143”) and the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 47 “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations” (“FIN 47”). Both pronouncements address the financial accounting and reporting requirements for conditional obligations associated with our legal obligation to retire tangible long-lived assets and the related asset retirement costs, principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of our tower assets are located. Under these accounting principles, we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made, and we accrete such liability through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. The associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets and depreciated over their estimated useful life. During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of $13.0 million and a net decrease in the estimated obligation of $3.8 million, respectively. The increase in 2008 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date assumptions, and the purchase of land underlying ground leases. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows, and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense. The significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions 46 Table of Contents are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary. • Stock-Based Compensation. We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment,” (“SFAS No. 123R”) and related pronouncements, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, restricted stock units and employee stock purchases under employee stock purchase plans. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service period, which generally represents the vesting period. The expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will be forfeited. Under SFAS No. 123R, the fair value of a stock option is determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the accounting measurement date, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock and its expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. These assumptions are highly subjective and changes in them could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the compensation expense. Under SFAS No. 123R, the fair value of restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our Common Stock on the grant date. • Impairment of Assets. Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization and Non-Core Long-Lived Assets Held for Sale: We review long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or our review of our tower portfolio indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Our tower portfolio review includes sites for which we have no current tenant leases and towers for which expenses exceed revenues. We assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows or anticipated proceeds from sales of the assets. If we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset’s fair market value as compared to its carrying value. We record any related impairment losses in the period in which we identify such impairment. We also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based on management’s best estimate of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition. We record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss. Goodwill—Assets Not Subject to Amortization: We perform our annual goodwill impairment test each year and when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. In December 2008, 2007 and 2006, we completed our annual impairment testing related to the goodwill of our rental and management segment and determined that goodwill was not impaired. Fair value estimates are based on our historical and projected operating results and market information, changes to which could affect those fair value estimates. • Revenue Recognition. Rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned, regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts. Fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancelable lease agreements, excluding those tied to the Consumer Price Index or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our customers are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the applicable leases. Straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 approximated $50.4 million, $69.7 million and $58.3 million, respectively. Amounts billed up-front for certain services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases. Amounts billed or 47 Table of Contents received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until the earnings process is complete. • Estimated Useful Lives of Assets. As described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included herein, during the year ended December 31, 2007 we undertook a review of the estimated useful lives of our tower assets to determine if we should modify our estimates for asset lives based on our historical operating experience. We completed the review of the estimated useful lives of our tower assets in the first quarter of 2008. Based on this review, we revised the estimated useful lives of our towers and certain related intangible assets from our historical estimate of 15 years to a revised estimate of 20 years, effective January 1, 2008. We accounted for the change in estimated useful lives as a change in estimate under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 154 “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.” The impact of the change in estimate was accounted for prospectively effective January 1, 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the change resulted in a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $121.2 million and an increase in net income of approximately $74.4 million. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities—Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (SFAS No. 159). This statement provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 was effective for us as of January 1, 2008. We have not elected the fair value option allowed under SFAS No. 159. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (SFAS No. 141R). SFAS No. 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. Among other items, SFAS No. 141R changes the accounting for acquisitions by eliminating the step acquisition model, providing that contingent consideration be recognized at the time of acquisition (instead of being recognized when it is probable), disallowing the capitalization of transaction costs, and changing when restructurings related to acquisitions can be recognized. SFAS No. 141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective for us for acquisitions made after the January 1, 2009 effective date. Amounts capitalized in notes receivable and other long-term assets as of December 31, 2008, include approximately $1.6 million of transaction costs that will be expensed upon the adoption of this standard. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51” (SFAS No. 160). Among other items, SFAS No. 160 establishes consolidating parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent’s ownership interest, and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No. 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160 is effective for us as of January 1, 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Positions (FSP) 157-1 and 157-2. FSP 157-1 amends SFAS No. 157 to exclude SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases,” (SFAS No. 13) and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions, while FSP 157-2 delays the effective date of the application to January 1, 2009 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis (that is, at least annually). In October 2008, the FASB 48 Table of Contents issued FSP 157-3. FSP 157-3 clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 when determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not currently active. FSP 157-3 emphasizes that approaches other than the market approach to determining fair value may be appropriate when it is determined that, as a result of market inactivity, other valuation approaches are more representative of fair value. Other valuation approaches can involve significant assumptions regarding future cash flows. FSP 157-3 clarifies that these assumptions must incorporate adjustments for nonperformance and liquidity risks that market participants would consider in valuing the asset in an inactive market. FSP 157-3 emphasizes the existing disclosure requirements under SFAS No. 157 regarding significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). FSP 157-3 became effective on October 10, 2008, including with respect to prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued. We did not elect to early adopt SFAS No. 157 for nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets or liabilities as allowed under FSP FAS 157-2. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (SFAS No. 161). Among other items, this statement changes disclosure requirements and requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why entities use derivative financial instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities” and related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for us as of January 1, 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 161 will have on our disclosures; however, the adoption of SFAS No. 161 will not have an impact on the determination of our financial results. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, “The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles” (SFAS No. 162). This statement identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in preparation of financial statements that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. SFAS No. 162 is effective for us 60 days following the SEC’s approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, “The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.” We are in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 162 will have on our consolidated results of operation and financial position. Information Presented Pursuant to the Indentures of our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes The following table sets forth information that is presented solely to address certain tower cash flow reporting requirements contained in the indentures for our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes. The indentures governing our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes contain restrictive covenants with which we and certain subsidiaries under these indentures must comply. These include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, guarantee debt, pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments. Any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default, which could result in the acceleration of the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest on all our outstanding 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes. In order for the holders of these notes to assess our compliance with certain of these covenants, the indentures require us to disclose in the periodic reports we file with the SEC our Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non-Tower Cash Flow (each as defined in the indentures). Under the indentures, our ability to make certain types of restricted payments is limited by the amount of Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow that we generate, which is determined based on our Tower Cash Flow and Non-Tower Cash Flow. In addition, the indentures for our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock if on a pro forma basis the issuance of such debt and preferred stock would cause our consolidated debt to be greater than 7.5 times our Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow. As of December 31, 2008, the ratio of our consolidated debt to Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow was approximately 3.5. For more information about the restrictions under our notes indentures, see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity.” 49 Table of Contents Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non-Tower Cash Flow are considered non-GAAP financial measures. We are required to provide these financial metrics by the indentures for our 7.50% Notes and 7.125% Notes, and we have included them below because we consider the indentures for these notes to be material agreements, the covenants related to Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non-Tower Cash Flow to be material terms of the indentures, and information about compliance with such covenants to be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity. The following table presents Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow and Non-Tower Cash Flow for the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, as defined in the indentures for the applicable notes (in thousands): Tower Cash Flow, for the three months ended December 31, 2008 $ 188,449 Consolidated Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 726,954 Less: Tower Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 (741,565 ) Plus: four times Tower Cash Flow, for the three months ended December 31, 2008 753,798 Adjusted Consolidated Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 739,187 Non-Tower Cash Flow, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 $ (14,611 ) 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long-term debt obligations. We attempt to reduce these risks by utilizing derivative financial instruments, namely interest rate swaps. During the year ended December 31, 2008, all derivative financial instruments were used for purposes other than trading. During 2008, we entered into twelve additional interest rate swap agreements and as of December 31, 2008, we held fifteen interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $775.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008, holders of $201.1 million principal amount of our convertible notes converted their notes, including the conversion of $18.3 million principal amount of 3.25% Notes and $182.8 million principal amount of 3.00% Notes into shares of our Common Stock. In March 2008, we entered into a new $325.0 million Term Loan, of which approximately $321.7 million was used, together with available cash, to repay $325.0 million of existing indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2008, $750.0 million was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. The following tables provide information as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates. For long-term debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows by maturity date and average interest rates related to outstanding obligations. For interest rate caps and swaps, the tables present notional principal amounts and weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.

As of December 31, 2008, fixed rate debt consists of: the Certificates issued in the securitization transaction ($1.75 billion); 2.25% convertible notes due 2009 (“2.25% Notes”) ($0.04 million); the 7.125% Notes ($500.0 million principal amount due at maturity; the balance as of December 31, 2008 is $501.1 million); the 5.0% Notes ($59.7 million); the 7.50% Notes ($225.0 million); the ATI 7.25% Notes ($0.3 million); the 3.00% Notes ($162.2 million principal amount due at maturity; the balance as of December 31, 2008 is $161.9 million accreted value); the 7.00% senior notes due 2017 (“7.00 Notes”) ($500.0 million) and other debt of $60.1 million. Interest on the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan is payable in accordance with the applicable LIBOR agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2008 for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan was 3.20%. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the weighted average interest rate under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan was 4.16%. As of December 31, 2007, variable rate debt consists of our Revolving Credit Facility ($825.0 million drawn) included above based on the June 8, 2012 maturity date. As of December 31, 2007, fixed rate debt consists of: the Certificates issued in the securitization transaction ($1.75 billion); 2.25% Notes ($0.04 million); the 7.125% Notes ($500.0 million principal amount due at maturity; the balance as of December 31, 2007 is $502.2 million); the 5.0% Notes ($59.7 million); the 3.25% Notes ($18.3 million); the 7.50% Notes ($225.0 million); the ATI 7.25% Notes ($0.3 million); the 3.00% Notes ($345.0 million principal amount due at maturity; the balance as of December 31, 2007 is $344.6 million accreted value); the 7.00% Notes ($500.0 million) and other debt of $60.2 million. Interest on the Revolving Credit Facility is payable in accordance with the applicable LIBOR agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2007 for the Revolving Credit Facility was 5.52%. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the weighted average interest rate under our credit facilities was 6.15%. (b) Includes notional amounts of $150.0 million that expire in December 2009. (c) Includes notional amount of $100.0 million that expires in December 2010. (d) Includes notional amounts of $175.0 million, $75.0 million and $275.0 million that expire in January, February, and March 2011, respectively. (e) Represents the weighted-average fixed rate or range of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts in a given year. Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2008, after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements, was comprised of $250.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility and $50.0 million under the Term Loan. A 10% increase, or approximately 32 basis points, in current interest rates would have caused an additional pre-tax charge to our net income and an increase in our cash outflows of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our foreign operations, including our rental and management segment divisions in Mexico, Brazil and India. For the three months ended December 31, 2008, the remeasurement gain from these operations approximated $6.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the remeasurement gain from these operations approximated $5.7 million. As of December 31, 2008, we held fifteen interest rate swap agreements, all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges, and which have an aggregate notional amount of $775.0 million, interest rates ranging from 2.86% to 4.08% and expiration dates through March 2011. 52 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:22:50.710124

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures in our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” beginning at page 45. Our continuing operations are reported in two segments, rental and management and network development services. Management focuses on segment gross margin and segment operating profit as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments. We define segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization and accretion; selling, general, administrative and development expense; and other operating expense. We define segment operating profit as segment gross margin less selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. Segment gross margin and segment operating profit for the rental and management segment also include interest income, TV Azteca, net (see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included herein). These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before interest income, interest expense, loss on retirement of long-term obligations, other income (expense), noncontrolling interest in net earnings of subsidiaries, income (loss) on equity method investments, income taxes and discontinued operations. Executive Overview Our principal operating segment is our rental and management segment, which accounted for approximately 97% of our total revenues, and approximately 99% of our segment operating profit for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. The primary factors affecting the consistent incremental growth in our revenues and cash flows for this segment are our recurring revenues generated from sites which existed in our portfolio as of the beginning of the prior year period (“legacy sites”), new revenue generated from new sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior year period (“new sites”), our existing tenant leases and related contractual escalations, leasing of additional space on our existing sites and the cancellation rate of our existing tenant leases. We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing site capacity. In addition, we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from customers providing wireless broadband services. As we continue to primarily focus on growing our rental and management business, we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. The majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are typically for an initial non-cancelable term of five to ten years, with multiple five-year renewal terms thereafter. Accordingly, nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of December 2009 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. In addition, most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease. These contractual escalations are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage (generally three to five percent), inflation, or a fixed percentage plus inflation. Revenue generated by rate increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable term of the applicable agreement. We also routinely seek to extend our tenant leases with our customers, which increases the non-cancelable term of the agreement and creates incremental growth in our revenues and cash flows. The revenues generated by our rental and management segment may also be affected by cancellations of existing customer leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters 27 Table of Contents are multi-year contracts, which typically may not be cancelled or, in some instances, may be cancelled only upon payment of a termination fee. Accordingly, lease cancellations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management segment. During the year ended December 31, 2009, tenant leases representing approximately 2% of our rental and management revenues were cancelled. During the year ended December 31, 2009, revenues generated by our rental and management segment increased $121.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to incremental revenue generated by our legacy sites which resulted from leasing additional space to new tenants, leasing additional space for the equipment of our existing tenants, as well as contractual tenant lease escalations. To a lesser extent, a portion of our revenue growth was attributable to the 4,511 new sites that we acquired or constructed since January 1, 2008. The increase in revenue was partially offset by tenant lease cancellations as well as the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and a reduction in straight-line revenue recognition. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and, to a lesser extent, the location of and available capacity on our existing sites. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure needs, the financial performance of our customers and their access to capital, and general economic conditions. We believe leasing additional space on our existing sites and expanding our site portfolio will contribute to the majority of our year-over-year revenue growth in 2010. Our rental and management segment operating expenses include our direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and utilities. These segment level expenses exclude all segment and corporate, selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling, general, administrative and development expense. Our segment level selling, general, administrative and development expenses consist of expenses to support our rental and management and network development services segments, such as sales and property management functions. In general, our segment level selling, general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our legacy sites and increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new customers on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow. In geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on materially expanding our site footprint, we may incur additional segment level selling, general and administrative expenses as we increase our presence in these areas. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities. 28 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 Year EndedDecember 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2009 2008 (In thousands) REVENUES: Rental and management $ 1,668,420 $ 1,547,035 $ 121,385 8 % Network development services 55,694 46,469 9,225 20 Total revenues 1,724,114 1,593,504 130,610 8 OPERATING EXPENSES: Costs of operations (exclusive of items shown separately below) Rental and management 383,990 363,024 20,966 6 Network development services 32,385 26,831 5,554 21 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 414,619 405,332 9,287 2 Selling, general, administrative and development expense (including stock-based compensation expense of $60,670 and $54,807, respectively) 201,694 180,374 21,320 12 Other operating expenses 19,168 11,189 7,979 71 Total operating expenses 1,051,856 986,750 65,106 7 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) AND OTHER ITEMS: Interest income, TV Azteca, net 14,210 14,253 (43 ) — Interest income 1,722 3,413 (1,691 ) (50 ) Interest expense (249,803 ) (253,584 ) (3,781 ) (1 ) Loss on retirement of long-term obligations (18,194 ) (4,904 ) 13,290 271 Other income 1,294 5,988 (4,694 ) (78 ) Income tax provision (182,565 ) (135,509 ) 47,056 35 Income on equity method investments 26 22 4 18 Income from continuing operations 238,948 236,433 2,515 1 Income from discontinued operations, net 8,179 110,982 (102,803 ) (93 ) Net income 247,127 347,415 (100,288 ) (29 ) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest (532 ) (169 ) 363 215 Net income attributable to American Tower Corporation $ 246,595 $ 347,246 $ (100,651 ) (29 )% Total Revenues Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $1,724.1 million, an increase of $130.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. Approximately $121.4 million of the increase was attributable to an increase in rental and management revenue, with the remaining portion of the increase attributable to network development services revenue. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $1,668.4 million, an increase of $121.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. Legacy sites contributed $73.4 million of the increase, which was primarily attributable to incremental revenue generated from adding new tenants to those sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites and contractual tenant lease escalations, partially offset by 29 Table of Contents tenant lease cancellations as well as the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and a reduction in straight-line revenue recognition. Approximately $48.0 million of the increase resulted from the 4,511 new sites that we acquired or constructed since January 1, 2008. Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $55.7 million, an increase of $9.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to revenues generated from our expanding site acquisition, zoning, permitting and installation services. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $1,051.9 million, an increase of $65.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in selling, general, administrative and development expense of $21.3 million, increases in expenses within our rental and management segment of $21.0 million and network development services segment of $5.6 million, an increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses of $9.3 million, and an increase in other operating expenses of $8.0 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Gross Margin/Segment Operating Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $384.0 million, an increase of $21.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. Increases in rental and management expenses of our legacy sites, consisting primarily of contractual ground lease escalations and inflationary increases, were offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Accordingly, the $21.0 million was attributable to the new sites added since January 1, 2008. Rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $1,298.6 million, an increase of $100.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase primarily resulted from additional rental and management revenue described above, partially offset by an increase in rental and management expense. Rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $1,212.5 million, an increase of $82.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. This increase was comprised of the $100.4 million increase in rental and management segment gross margin described above, partially offset by an increase of approximately $18.1 million in selling, general, administrative and development expenses related to our rental and management segment, due in large part to our international expansion. Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $32.4 million, an increase of $5.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase correlates to the growth in services performed as noted above. Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Depreciation, amortization and accretion for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $414.6 million, an increase of $9.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. This increase was primarily attributable to depreciation, amortization and accretion associated with the acquisition or construction of 3,550 sites during 2009, which resulted in an increase in property, plant and equipment. 30 Table of Contents Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense Selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $201.7 million, an increase of $21.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately $5.9 million in stock based compensation expense, which was principally driven by the additional expense recognized upon the modification of certain equity awards during the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $5.9 million of bad debt expense, an increase of $5.4 million for the write-off of capitalized costs related to discontinued projects and an increase in the cost to support our growth in international geographic areas. For the year ended December 31, 2008, selling, general, administrative and development expense included a one-time reduction related to payroll tax expense of approximately $3.1 million. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $19.2 million, an increase of $8.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was primarily attributable to approximately $6.3 million in acquisition related costs which have been expensed as a result of new accounting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). Approximately $1.2 million of these costs are related to the expensing of amounts which had been recorded as other long-term assets at December 31, 2008 for pending acquisitions and the remaining $5.1 million relates to additional acquisition related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2009. Approximately $1.4 million of the increase was attributable to an increase in impairments and losses on the sale of assets. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $249.8 million, a decrease of $3.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in average outstanding debt of approximately $107.8 million. Loss on Retirement of Long-Term Obligations Loss on retirement of long-term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $18.2 million, an increase of $13.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2009, pursuant to a tender offer and subsequent redemption, we repurchased and redeemed an aggregate of $225.0 million principal amount of 7.50% Notes for an aggregate purchase price of $231.7 million, including accrued and unpaid interest, and we repurchased an aggregate of $500.0 million principal amount of 7.125% Notes for an aggregate purchase price of $511.7 million, including accrued and unpaid interest. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a charge of $18.2 million related to the amounts paid in excess of carrying value and the write-off of the related deferred financing fees, discounts and premiums. During the year ended December 31, 2008, holders of approximately $18.3 million principal amount of our 3.25% convertible notes due August 15, 2012 (“3.25% Notes”) and $182.8 million principal amount of our 3.00% Notes converted their notes into shares of our Common Stock. In connection with conversions of a portion of these notes, we paid holders an aggregate of approximately $4.9 million, calculated based on the discounted value of the future interest payments on their notes. For more information regarding our financing activities, see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash Flows from Financing Activities” below. 31 Table of Contents Other Income Other income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was approximately $1.3 million, as compared to other income of approximately $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2009, other income of $1.3 million consisted primarily of a gain of approximately $1.7 million on the settlement of a foreign currency exchange contract executed to hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with our acquisition of XCEL, partially offset by foreign currency remeasurement losses of approximately $0.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded foreign currency remeasurement gains of approximately $5.7 million. Income Tax Provision The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $182.6 million, an increase of $47.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. The effective tax rate was 43.3% for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to an effective tax rate of 36.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, is primarily due to the discrete impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain tax items, IRS audit adjustments and certain valuation allowances, partially offset by the decrease in tax reserves. The increase in the income tax provision correlates to the increase in income during the year ended December 31, 2009 as noted above. The effective tax rates on income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 differ from the federal statutory rate due primarily to adjustments for foreign items, non-deductible stock-based compensation expense, IRS audit adjustments of approximately $10.0 million, tax reserves and state taxes. As we continue to evaluate our organizational structure in light of our expansion within Latin America, we anticipate that the implementation of certain restructuring activities could have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate in 2010. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net Income from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $8.2 million, a decrease of $102.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. This decrease is primarily attributable to the recording of an income tax benefit of $110.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, related to losses associated with our investment in our wholly owned subsidiary, Verestar, Inc. (“Verestar”). Verestar filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in December 2003. During 2007, we settled the litigation related to the Verestar bankruptcy. In April 2008, the bankruptcy court approved Verestar’s plan of liquidation and in December 2008, Verestar was liquidated. The $102.8 million decrease was partially offset by an insurance reimbursement received during the year ended December 31, 2009 for approximately $5.0 million related to the Verestar bankruptcy settlement. 32 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 Year EndedDecember 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2008 2007 (In thousands) REVENUES: Rental and management $ 1,547,035 $ 1,425,975 $ 121,060 8 % Network development services 46,469 30,619 15,850 52 Total revenues 1,593,504 1,456,594 136,910 9 OPERATING EXPENSES: Costs of operations (exclusive of items shown separately below) Rental and management 363,024 343,450 19,574 6 Network development services 26,831 16,172 10,659 66 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 405,332 522,928 (117,596 ) (22 ) Selling, general, administrative and development expense (including stock-based compensation expense of $54,807 and $54,603, respectively) 180,374 186,483 (6,109 ) (3 ) Other operating expenses 11,189 9,198 1,991 22 Total operating expenses 986,750 1,078,231 (91,481 ) (8 ) OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) AND OTHER ITEMS: Interest income, TV Azteca, net 14,253 14,207 46 Interest income 3,413 10,848 (7,435 ) (69 ) Interest expense (253,584 ) (235,824 ) 17,760 8 Loss on retirement of long-term obligations (4,904 ) (35,429 ) (30,525 ) (86 ) Other income 5,988 20,675 (14,687 ) (71 ) Income tax provision (135,509 ) (59,809 ) 75,700 127 Income on equity method investments 22 19 3 16 Income from continuing operations 236,433 93,050 143,383 154 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net 110,982 (36,396 ) 147,378 405 Net income 347,415 56,654 290,761 513 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest (169 ) (338 ) (169 ) (50 ) Net income attributable to American Tower Corporation $ 347,246 $ 56,316 $ 290,930 517 % Total Revenues Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $1,593.5 million, an increase of $136.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $121.1 million of the increase was attributable to an increase in rental and management revenue. The balance of the increase resulted from an increase in network development services revenue of $15.9 million. Rental and Management Revenue Rental and management revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $1,547.0 million, an increase of $121.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. Legacy sites contributed approximately $95.4 million of the increase, which was primarily attributable to incremental revenue generated from adding new tenants to those sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites and contractual tenant lease escalations, partially offset by tenant lease cancellations as well as a reduction in straight-line revenue recognition. Approximately $25.7 million of the increase resulted from the 1,420 new sites that we acquired or constructed since January 1, 2007. 33 Table of Contents Network Development Services Revenue Network development services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $46.5 million, an increase of $15.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to revenues generated from our site acquisition, zoning, permitting and installation services. Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $986.8 million, a decrease of approximately $91.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was attributable to decreases in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense and selling, general, administrative and development expense of $117.6 million and $6.1 million, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in expenses within our rental and management segment of $19.6 million, an increase in expenses within our network development services segment of $10.7 million and an increase in other operating expense of $2.0 million. Rental and Management Expense/Segment Gross Margin/Segment Operating Profit Rental and management expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $363.0 million, an increase of $19.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $10.4 million of the increase was attributable to legacy sites and was primarily related to increases due to contractual ground lease escalations. The remaining $9.2 million of the increase was attributable to the new sites added since January 1, 2007. Rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $1,198.3 million, an increase of $101.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase resulted from the additional rental and management revenue described above, partially offset by the increase in rental and management expense. Rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $1,130.2 million, an increase of $99.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. This was comprised of the $101.5 million increase in rental and management segment gross margin described above, net of an increase of $2.2 million in selling, general, administrative and development expenses related to the rental and management segment. Network Development Services Expense Network development services expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $26.8 million, an increase of $10.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The majority of the increase correlates to the growth in services performed as noted above. Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $405.3 million, a decrease of $117.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily due to our revision of the estimated useful lives of our towers and certain related intangible assets from our historical estimate of 15 years to a revised estimate of 20 years, partially offset by the depreciation, amortization and accretion expense associated with the acquisition or construction of 961 sites during 2008. The change in the estimated useful lives of our towers was based on a review that we completed in the first quarter of 2008, the effect of which was accounted for prospectively effective January 1, 2008, which resulted in a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $121.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense Selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $180.4 million, a decrease of $6.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily 34 Table of Contents attributable to a decrease of approximately $12.8 million in costs associated with the legal and governmental proceedings related to the review of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting, and other related costs, partially offset by increases of approximately $6.7 million in expenses associated with international business development and information technology spending. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $11.2 million, an increase of $2.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily due to a $1.4 million increase in losses recognized upon the disposal of certain non-core tower assets. Interest Income Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $3.4 million, a decrease of $7.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in average interest rates from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $253.6 million, an increase of $17.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily attributable to an approximately 13% increase in our average outstanding debt, as a result of the debt financing activities described in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below, partially offset by a decrease in the average borrowing rate. Loss on Retirement of Long-Term Obligations Loss on retirement of long-term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $4.9 million, a decrease of $30.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2008, holders of approximately $18.3 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes and $182.8 million principal amount of our 3.00% Notes converted their notes into shares of our Common Stock. In connection with conversions of a portion of these notes, we paid holders an aggregate of approximately $4.9 million, calculated based on the discounted value of the future interest payments on their notes. During the year ended December 31, 2007, holders of approximately $89.5 million principal amount of our 3.25% Notes converted their notes into shares of our Common Stock, and we repurchased pursuant to tender offers approximately $192.5 million principal amount of our 5.0% convertible notes due 2010 (“5.0% Notes”) and $324.8 million principal amount of our ATI 7.25% senior subordinated notes due 2011 (“ATI 7.25% Notes”). We also repaid all amounts outstanding under the credit facilities of SpectraSite and at the American Tower operating company level, and we terminated all commitments thereunder. In addition, we repaid all amounts outstanding under our $500.0 million senior unsecured term loan credit facility and terminated the loan. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a charge of $35.4 million related to amounts paid in excess of the carrying value of our 5.0% Notes and ATI 7.25% Notes, amounts paid to holders of our 3.25% Notes in connection with their note conversions, and the write-off of related deferred financing fees. For more information regarding our financing activities, see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Cash Flows from Financing Activities” below. Other Income Other income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $6.0 million, a decrease of $14.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2007. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2008, consisted primarily of 35 Table of Contents foreign currency gains of $5.7 million. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2007 consisted primarily of approximately $18.0 million of gains from the sale of available-for-sale securities and the mark-to-market and subsequent settlement of interest rate swap agreements. Income Tax Provision The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $135.5 million, as compared to $59.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, representing an increase of $75.7 million from the prior year period. The effective tax rate was 36.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to 39.1% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the income tax provision correlates to the increase in income during the year ended December 31, 2008 as noted above. The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign currency gains, the reversal of $6.4 million of valuation allowances related to our Mexican subsidiary and state taxes. Other differences from the federal statutory rate include other foreign items, settlement of tax reserves, non-deductible stock-based compensation expense and additional tax reserves. In the year ended December 31, 2007, we recovered a portion of our deferred tax asset through our federal income tax refund claims related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses. In June 2003 and October 2003, we filed federal income tax refund claims with the IRS relating to the carry back of $380.0 million of net operating losses generated prior to 2003. In April 2007, we received a refund of approximately $65.0 million, plus $15.0 million in interest, substantially all of which was accrued at March 31, 2007. Income (Loss) From Discontinued Operations, Net Income from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $111.0 million, as compared to a loss from discontinued operations of $36.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded an income tax benefit related to losses associated with our investment in Verestar. We recorded an income tax benefit of $110.1 million related to losses associated with our investment in Verestar as income from discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a $32.0 million liability associated with the Verestar bankruptcy proceedings equal to the settlement amount, which we paid in November 2007. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview As a holding company, our cash flows are derived primarily from the operations of and distributions from our operating subsidiaries or funds raised through borrowings under our credit facilities and debt and equity offerings. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $943.1 million of total liquidity, comprised of approximately $247.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to borrow approximately $695.8 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2009, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $104.2 million as compared to December 31, 2008. Summary cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 is set forth below. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 842,126 $ 773,258 $ 692,679 Investing activities (543,066 ) (274,940 ) (186,180 ) Financing activities (194,942 ) (388,172 ) (754,640 ) Net effect of changes in exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 98 (192 ) — Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 104,216 $ 109,954 $ (248,141 ) 36 Table of Contents We use our cash flows to fund our operations and investments in our business, including tower maintenance and improvements, tower construction and DAS network installations, and tower and land acquisitions. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we also used a significant amount of our cash flows to fund refinancing and repurchases of our outstanding indebtedness, as well as our stock repurchase program. By refinancing and repurchasing a portion of our outstanding indebtedness, we improved our financial position, which increased our financial flexibility and our ability to return value to our stockholders. Our significant financing transactions in 2009 included the following: • We extended the maturity dates and lowered the cost of our debt by completing two institutional private placements of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.25% Notes and $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.625% Notes. • We reduced the amount of indebtedness outstanding under our senior and convertible notes through repurchases or redemptions of $725.1 million face amount of our outstanding debt securities. • We repurchased approximately 6.6 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $214.7 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to our stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2009, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $4.2 billion. We generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and cash interest obligations in 2009. We believe our cash generated by operations for the year ending December 31, 2010 also will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and our cash debt service (interest and principal repayments) obligations for 2010. For more information regarding our financing transactions in 2009, see “—Cash Flows from Financing Activities” below. Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash provided by operating activities was $842.1 million, an increase of $68.9 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. This increase was primarily comprised of an increase of $84.5 million in the operating profit of our operating segments, partially offset by an increase in the amount spent to meet working capital needs. For the year ended December 31, 2008, cash provided by operating activities was $773.3 million, an increase of approximately $80.6 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately $103.9 million in the operating profit of our operating segments, partially offset by an increase in the amount spent to meet working capital needs. Each of our rental and management and network development services segments are expected to generate cash flows from operations during 2010 in excess of their cash needs for operations and expenditures for tower construction, improvements and acquisitions. Cash Flows from Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash used for investing activities was $543.1 million, an increase of approximately $268.1 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. This increase was primarily comprised of increased spending for acquisitions, property and equipment and construction activities during the year ended December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2009, payments for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities totaled $250.3 million, including $63.8 million of capital expenditures related to the maintenance, improvement and redevelopment of our existing communications sites, $129.9 million spent in 37 Table of Contents connection with the construction of 1,024 towers, the installation of 21 in-building DAS networks and the installation of shared back-up power generators, $49.1 million spent to acquire land under our towers that was subject to ground agreements (including leases), and $7.5 million spent on information technology improvements. In addition, during the year-ended December 31, 2009, we spent $98.0 million, net of $6.0 million cash acquired, to acquire XCEL, $19.9 million, net of $0.2 million cash acquired, to acquire Insight, and $183.9 million to acquire 522 additional towers. We plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria. Accordingly, we may continue to acquire communications sites, acquire land under our towers, build or install new communications sites and redevelop or improve existing communications sites when the expected returns on such investments meet our return on investment criteria. We expect that our total capital expenditures will be between approximately $300 million and $350 million in 2010, with spending for capital improvements, corporate expenditures and the redevelopment of existing communications sites at levels comparable to 2009. Additionally, we expect to spend approximately $50 million for ground lease purchases and $165 million to $205 million for other discretionary capital projects including the construction of approximately 1,200 to 1,600 new communications sites. For the year ended December 31, 2008, cash used for investing activities was $274.9 million, an increase of approximately $88.8 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to increased spending for the purchase of property and equipment and construction activities and acquisitions of approximately $89.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008, payments for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities totaled $243.5 million, including $105.5 million of capital expenditures related to the maintenance, improvement and redevelopment of our existing communications sites, $90.7 million spent in connection with the construction of 676 towers and the installation of 16 in-building DAS networks, $41.7 million spent to acquire land under our towers that was subject to ground agreements (including leases), and $5.6 million spent on information technology improvements. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2008, we spent $42.8 million to acquire 269 towers. Cash Flows from Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash used for financing activities was $194.9 million, as compared to cash used for financing activities of approximately $388.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The cash used for financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily related to the tender offer and subsequent redemption of the 7.50% Notes, the redemption of the 7.125% Notes, the repayment of credit facilities and capital leases of approximately $931.2 million and payments for the repurchase of our Common Stock of $213.3 million, which consisted primarily of stock repurchases under our 2008 Buyback; partially offset by $900.0 million ($884.1 million, net of commissions and expenses) of proceeds from the issuance of the 7.25% Notes and the 4.625% Notes and approximately $66.0 million of proceeds from stock options, warrants and the employee stock purchase plan. For the year ended December 31, 2008, cash used for financing activities was $388.2 million, a decrease of approximately $366.5 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately $928.2 million in purchases of our Common Stock and a decrease of $44.7 million in deferred financing costs and other financing activities. These decreases were partially offset by the absence of any new debt issuances during the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to the issuance of approximately $2,250.0 million in debt during the year ended December 31, 2007. Borrowings under our credit facilities during the year ended December 31, 2008 were approximately $575.0 million, as compared to $2,175.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. The borrowings and debt issuances were offset by debt repayments of approximately $327.5 million and $3,612.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2009, we had $550.0 million outstanding and the ability to borrow approximately $695.8 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. We continue to maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility in the ordinary course. 38 Table of Contents The borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility is American Tower Corporation. The Revolving Credit Facility has a term of five years and matures on June 8, 2012. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The Revolving Credit Facility does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. The Revolving Credit Facility allows us to use borrowings for our and our subsidiaries’ working capital needs and other general corporate purposes (including, without limitation, to refinance or repurchase other indebtedness and, provided certain conditions are met, to repurchase our equity securities, in each case without additional lender approval). Term Loan. On March 24, 2008, we entered into the $325.0 million Term Loan pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility. At closing, we received net proceeds of approximately $321.7 million from the Term Loan, which, together with available cash, we used to repay $325.0 million of existing indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Term Loan is governed by the terms of the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility. Consistent with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, the borrower under the Term Loan is American Tower Corporation, and the maturity date for the Term Loan is June 8, 2012. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The Term Loan does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. XCEL Credit Facility. At the time of our acquisition of XCEL, a 4.8 billion Indian Rupee-denominated credit facility (“XCEL Credit Facility”) was in place, of which 3.4 billion Indian Rupees was outstanding. The borrower under the XCEL Credit Facility is XCEL. The XCEL Credit Facility has a term of four years and matures on March 31, 2016. Interest is payable monthly and accrues at an initial rate of 13.25% per year. In March 2010, the initial interest rate will be adjusted based upon the benchmark rate of interest of each lender. The XCEL Credit Facility allows us to use borrowings for construction and acquisition of communications sites and is secured by a first mortgage on all movable and immovable fixed assets of XCEL and a pledge of certain equity interests of XCEL. Senior Notes Offerings. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we completed institutional private placements of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.25% Notes and $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.625% Notes. The net proceeds from the 7.25% Notes offering were approximately $290.2 million, after deducting commissions and expenses. We used $210.2 million of the net proceeds to finance the repurchase through a cash tender offer and subsequent redemption of our outstanding 7.50% Notes. In addition, we used $50.0 million of the net proceeds to repay certain of our outstanding indebtedness incurred under our Revolving Credit Facility. The net proceeds from the 4.625% Notes offering were approximately $593.9 million, after deducting commissions and expenses. We used $511.7 million of the net proceeds to finance the redemption of our outstanding 7.125% Notes. The remainder of the net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. The 7.25% Notes mature on May 15, 2019, and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing November 15, 2009, to the persons in whose names the notes are registered at the close of business on the preceding May 1 and November 1, respectively. We may redeem the 7.25% Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date. Interest on the notes will accrue from June 10, 2009 and will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The 4.625% Notes will mature on April 1, 2015, and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2010, to the persons in whose names the notes are registered at the close of business on the preceding March 15 and September 15, respectively. We may redeem the 4.625% Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date. Interest on the notes will accrue from October 20, 2009 and will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. 39 Table of Contents If we undergo a change of control and ratings decline (in the event that on, or within 90 days after, an announcement of a change of control, both of our current investment grade credit ratings cease to be investment grade), each as defined in the indenture for the 7.25% Notes and 4.625% Notes, we may be required to repurchase all of the 7.25% Notes or 4.625% Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional interest, if any, up to but not including the date of repurchase. The 7.25% Notes and 4.625% Notes rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries. Each indenture contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that we may incur liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness, if the aggregate amount of such liens does not exceed 3.5x Adjusted EBITDA as defined in each indenture. Stock Repurchase Program. In 2009, we continued to repurchase shares of our Common Stock pursuant to our 2008 Buyback. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we repurchased 6.6 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate of $214.7 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the 2008 Buyback. As of December 31, 2009, we had repurchased 20.5 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate of $748.1 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the 2008 Buyback. In the near term, we expect to fund any further repurchases of our Common Stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Purchases under the 2008 Buyback are subject to us having available cash to fund repurchases. Under the 2008 Buyback, we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. To facilitate repurchases, we purchase our Common Stock pursuant to trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, which allow us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. Subsequent to December 31, 2009, we repurchased approximately 0.8 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate of $33.5 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the 2008 Buyback. As of February 12, 2010, we had repurchased a total of 21.3 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate of $781.6 million, including commissions and fees pursuant to the 2008 Buyback. We expect to continue to manage the pacing of the remaining $718.4 million under the 2008 Buyback in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors. Sales of Equity Securities. We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plans and upon exercise of warrants to purchase our equity securities. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we received an aggregate of $66.0 million in proceeds from sales of shares pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, upon exercises of stock options and upon exercises of warrants. 40 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations. Our contractual obligations relate primarily to the Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-1 issued in our Securitization, borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan, our outstanding notes and our operating leases related to the ground under our towers. The following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations payable in cash as of December 31, 2009 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-1 $ 1,750,000 $ 1,750,000 Revolving Credit Facility(1) $ 550,000 550,000 Term Loan(1) 325,000 325,000 XCEL credit facility $ 9,171 $ 13,953 11,822 $ 11,822 $ 11,822 14,777 73,367 7.25% senior subordinated notes 288 288 7.25% senior notes 300,000 300,000 7.00% senior notes 500,000 500,000 4.625% senior notes 600,000 600,000 5.0% convertible notes(2) 59,683 59,683 Long-term obligations, excluding capital leases and other notes payable $ 68,854 $ 14,241 $ 886,822 $ 11,822 $ 1,761,822 $ 1,414,777 $ 4,158,338 Cash interest expense(1) 223,000 202,000 192,000 188,000 112,000 204,000 1,121,000 Capital lease payments (including interest) and other notes payable 5,744 5,482 4,898 4,755 4,800 198,182 223,861 Total debt service obligations $ 297,598 $ 221,723 $ 1,083,720 $ 204,577 $ 1,878,622 $ 1,816,959 $ 5,503,199 Operating lease payments(3) 258,427 251,553 243,457 237,828 233,483 2,814,908 4,039,656 Purchase obligations(4) 18,000 18,000 Other long-term liabilities(5)(6) 583 611 626 642 651 872,393 875,506 Total $ 574,608 $ 473,887 $ 1,327,803 $ 443,047 $ 2,112,756 $ 5,504,260 $ 10,436,361 (1) The Company has the option of choosing either a defined base rate or the London Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) as the applicable base interest rate for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan. For the Revolving Credit Facility, the interest rate ranges between 0.40% and 1.25% above the applicable LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.00% and 0.25% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on our debt ratings. For the Term Loan, the interest rate ranges between 0.50% and 1.50% above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.00% and 0.50% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on our debt ratings. A quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the Revolving Credit Facility is required, ranging from 0.08% to 0.25% per annum, based on our debt ratings. As discussed in Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” we have entered into swap agreements to manage exposure to variable rate interest obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan. As a result of these swap agreements, the effective weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2009 for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan was 2.84%. For projections of our cash interest expense related to the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan, we have assumed the LIBOR rate before the margin, as defined in the loan agreement, is 0.25% through its maturity on June 7, 2012. 41 Table of Contents (2) Our 5.0% convertible notes matured on February 15, 2010. We used cash on hand to repay the full amount outstanding. (3) Operating lease payments include payments to be made under non-cancelable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that we will renew the lease. (4) Pursuant to a definitive purchase agreement, we are obligated to acquire 114 towers in Brazil, pending regulatory approvals, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $18.0 million. If regulatory approvals are not obtained by June 30, 2010, the definitive purchase agreement expires, unless extended by mutual consent of the parties. (5) Primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other long-term liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily our straight-line rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash. (6) Other long-term liabilities exclude $16.5 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and $15.2 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled. Settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe. However, based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements, we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Refinancing Activities In order to extend the maturity dates of our indebtedness, lower our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance our outstanding indebtedness. Tender Offer for and Redemption of 7.50% Senior Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we repurchased $204.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.50% Notes pursuant to a cash tender offer. We paid $210.2 million, including approximately $1.7 million in accrued and unpaid interest, to holders of the 7.50% Notes using net proceeds from the institutional private placement of the 7.25% Notes discussed above. Subsequent to the expiration of the tender offer, we completed the redemption of the remaining $20.8 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes. In accordance with the redemption provisions and the indenture for the 7.50% Notes, the remaining 7.50% Notes were redeemed at a price equal to 101.875% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, July 20, 2009, for an aggregate purchase price of $21.5 million, including accrued and unpaid interest of approximately $0.3 million. Upon completion of this redemption, none of the 7.50% Notes remained outstanding. Redemption of 3.00% Convertible Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we issued a notice for the redemption of the remaining $162.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.00% Notes. In accordance with the conversion provisions and the indenture for the 3.00% Notes, holders of the 3.00% Notes had the right at any time up to and including, but not after the close of business on August 26, 2009, to convert their 3.00% Notes into shares of our Common Stock at a conversion rate of 48.7805 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes. Holders of approximately $162.1 million of the 3.00% Notes converted their notes into an aggregate of 7,908,316 shares of Common Stock prior to redemption. In accordance with the redemption provisions and the indenture for the 3.00% Notes, the remaining 3.00% Notes were redeemed at a price equal to 101.125% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, August 27, 2009, for an aggregate purchase price of $0.1 million. Upon completion of this redemption, none of the 3.00% Notes remained outstanding. 42 Table of Contents Redemption of 7.125% Senior Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we issued a notice for the redemption of the principal amount of our outstanding 7.125% Notes. In accordance with the redemption provisions and the indenture for the 7.125% Notes, the 7.125% Notes were redeemed at a price equal to 101.781% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, November 13, 2009, for an aggregate purchase price of $511.7 million, including approximately $2.8 million of accrued and unpaid interest. Upon completion of this redemption, none of the 7.125% Notes remained outstanding. Interest Rate Swap Agreements. As of December 31, 2009, we held 13 interest rate swap agreements, all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges, and which have an aggregate notional amount of $625.0 million, interest rates ranging from 2.86% to 4.08% and expiration dates through March 2011. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Internally Generated Funds. Because the majority of our tenant leases are multi-year contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of 2009 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites. Restrictions Under Loan Agreement Relating to Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan. The loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan contains certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and all of our subsidiaries designated as restricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreement also contains covenants that establish three financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage, senior secured leverage and interest coverage, as set forth below. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. • Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the loan agreement) of 6.00 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, we could incur approximately $2.74 billion of additional indebtedness and still remain in compliance with this ratio. In addition, if we maintain our existing debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $456 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. • Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of Senior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA of 3.00 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, we could incur approximately $1.69 billion of additional Senior Secured Debt and still remain in compliance with this ratio. In addition, if we maintain our existing Senior Secured Debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $562 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. • Interest Coverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we maintain a ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense of not less than 2.50 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, our interest expense, which was $238 million for that period, could increase by approximately $225 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. In addition, if our interest expense does not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $563 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. 43 Table of Contents The loan agreement also contains reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants. Any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the facility, but would constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next twelve months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. Restrictions Under Loan Agreement Relating to Securitization. The loan agreement related to the Securitization involved assets related to 5,295 broadcast and wireless communications towers owned by two special purpose subsidiaries of the Company (the “Borrowers”), through a private offering of $1.75 billion of Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-1 (the “Certificates”). The Securitization loan agreement includes certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the Borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. The Borrowers’ organizational documents contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities, including the requirement that the Borrowers maintain at least two independent directors. The Securitization loan agreement also contains certain covenants that require the Borrowers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets, promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the Securitization loan agreement and other agreements related to the towers subject to the Securitization, and allow the trustee reasonable access to the towers, including the right to conduct site investigations. Under the terms of the Securitization loan agreement, the loan will be paid solely from the cash flows generated by the towers subject to the Securitization, which must be deposited, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the Securitization loan. The Borrowers are required to make monthly payments of interest on the Securitization loan. On a monthly basis, all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the Securitization loan, referred to as excess cash flow, is to be released to the Borrowers for distribution to us. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Borrowers distributed excess cash to us of approximately $447.4 million. In order to distribute this excess cash flow to us, the Borrowers must maintain several specified ratios with respect to their debt service coverage (“DSCR”). For this purpose, DSCR is tested as of the last day of each calendar quarter and is generally defined as four times the Borrowers’ net cash flow for that quarter divided by the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees that the Borrowers must pay over the succeeding twelve months on the Securitization loan. Pursuant to one such test, if the DSCR as of the end of any calendar quarter were: • 1.30x or less, during the five-year period commencing on the closing date of the Securitization in May 2007, or • 1.75x or less, thereafter, (1.30x or 1.75x as applicable, the “Cash Trap DSCR”), then all excess cash flow would be placed in a reserve account and would not be released to the Borrowers for distribution to us until the DSCR exceeded the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. 44 Table of Contents Additionally, while principal payments generally are not due with respect to any component of the Securitization loan until April 2014, excess cash flow would be applied to principal during an “Amortization Period” under the Securitization loan until April 2014. An “Amortization Period” would commence under the Securitization loan if the DSCR as of the end of any calendar quarter fell below: • 1.15x, during the five-year period commencing on the closing date of the Securitization in May 2007, or • 1.45x thereafter (1.15x or 1.45x as applicable, the “Minimum DSCR”). In such a case, all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve account because the Cash Trap DSCR was not met would be applied to pay principal of the Securitization loan on each monthly payment date until the DSCR exceeded the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Consequently, a failure to comply with the covenants in the Securitization loan agreement could prevent the Borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers. Additionally, a failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent the Borrowers from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our discretionary expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions, and our stock repurchase program. In addition, if the Borrowers were to default on the loan related to the Securitization, the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the Securitization, in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers. As of December 31, 2009, the Borrowers’ DSCR was 3.10x. Based on the Borrowers’ net cash flow for the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2009 and the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the Securitization loan, the Borrowers could endure a reduction of approximately $177.5 million in net cash flow before triggering a Cash Trap DSCR, and approximately $192.3 million in net cash flow before triggering an Amortization Period. As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness. In addition, in order to fund future growth and expansion initiatives and fund our stock repurchase program, we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities. If we determined that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund future growth expansion initiatives, refinance our existing indebtedness or fund our stock repurchase program. In addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under the caption “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and, consequently, a failure by a significant customer to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity. As also set forth in that Item, as of December 31, 2009, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have primarily caused a subsidiary of Grupo Iusacell, which represented approximately 5% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009, to suspend debt service payments on its U.S. Dollar denominated debt. While Grupo Iusacell has continued to make partial payments to us, our net accounts receivable related to Grupo Iusacell was approximately $28.2 million as of December 31, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related 45 Table of Contents disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to impairment of assets, asset retirement obligations, revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and estimated useful lives of assets. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2009. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. For a discussion of our other accounting policies, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, beginning on page F-7. • Impairment of Assets—Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization and Non-Core Long-Lived Assets Held for Sale: We review long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable. We review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indications of impairment, which primarily result from a tower not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. We monitor our customer related intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indications of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts, or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows or anticipated proceeds from sales of the assets. If we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset’s fair market value, as compared to the asset’s carrying value. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment. • Impairment of Assets—Goodwill—Assets Not Subject to Amortization: We review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. All of our goodwill is recorded in our rental and management segment and tested for impairment annually as of December 31 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We utilize the two step traditional impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment. When conducting this test, we employ a discounted cash flow analysis, corroborated by a peer group and market valuation analysis. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results, the current weighted average cost of capital, and a current tax rate. Under the first step of this test, we compare the fair value, as calculated using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying value of the rental and management reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we conduct the second step of this test, in which the implied fair value of the rental and management reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized. During the year ended December 31, 2009, no impairment was determined under the first step of the test. We performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that none 46 Table of Contents of the following negative changes in our assumptions individually, which we determined to be reasonable, would impact our conclusions: a 15% reduction in projected net income, a 200 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital, and a 15% reduction in terminal sales growth rate. • Asset Retirement Obligations: We recognize asset retirement obligations associated with our legal obligation to retire tangible long-lived assets and the related asset retirement costs, principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of our tower assets are located, in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made, and we accrete such liability through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. The associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets and depreciated over their estimated useful life. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of $18.9 million and $13.0 million, respectively. The increase in 2009 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows, and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense. The significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary. • Revenue Recognition: Rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned, regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts. Fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancelable lease agreements, excluding those tied to the Consumer Price Index or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our customers are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the applicable leases. Straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 approximated $36.3 million, $50.4 million and $69.7 million, respectively. Amounts billed up-front for certain services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases. Amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until the earnings process is complete. • Stock-Based Compensation: We measure stock-based compensation cost at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and the fair value is recognized as an expense over the service period, which generally represents the vesting period. The expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will be forfeited. The fair value of a stock option is determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the accounting measurement date, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock and its expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. These assumptions are highly subjective and changes in them could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the compensation expense. The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our Common Stock on the grant date. • Income Taxes: We adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe, or if the applicable 47 Table of Contents statute of limitations lapses. We believe that the amount of the change could range from zero to $1.0 million. As of December 31, 2009, we have classified approximately $16.5 million as other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. We also classified approximately $15.2 million of accrued income tax-related interest and penalties as other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009. We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2009, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $47.8 million which primarily relates to state net operating loss carryforwards, equity investments and foreign items. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as we believe that we will have sufficient taxable income to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty-year tax carryforward period. Valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $0.9 billion and $0.9 billion in federal and state taxable income, respectively, from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2029. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described above, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our international operations. From time to time, we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations, and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. We believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December 31, 2009. • Estimated Useful Lives of Assets: As described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included herein, we completed the review of the estimated useful lives of our tower assets in the first quarter of 2008. Based on this review, we revised the estimated useful lives of our towers and certain related intangible assets, primarily its network location intangible assets, from our historical estimate of 15 years to a revised estimate of 20 years, effective January 1, 2008. We accounted for the change in estimated useful lives as a change in estimate which was accounted for prospectively effective January 1, 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the change resulted in a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $121.2 million and an increase in net income of approximately $74.4 million. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In September 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which designated the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) as the source of all authoritative GAAP to be applied by nongovernmental 48 Table of Contents entities. All guidance contained in the ASC carries an equal level of authority. The ASC supersedes all existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. All other nongrandfathered non-SEC accounting literature not included in the ASC is considered nonauthoritative. The implementation and adoption of the guidance provided by the ASC had no impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In December 2007, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which, among other things, eliminates the step acquisition model, requires that contingent consideration be recognized at the time of acquisition (instead of being recognized when it is probable), disallows the capitalization of transaction costs, and changes when restructurings related to acquisitions can be recognized. This guidance also establishes additional disclosure requirements that enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of business combinations. This guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2009 and, upon adoption, approximately $1.2 million of transaction costs previously capitalized in notes receivable and other long-term assets was expensed. In December 2007, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which requires the classification of noncontrolling interest as a separate component of equity and disclosure clearly identifying, and distinguishing between, parent and noncontrolling owner interests. This guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2009 and did not materially impact our consolidated results of operations and financial position. However, we have adjusted our presentation of noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. In February 2008, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which delayed the effective date of applying fair value measures to all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis (that is, at least annually) to January 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In March 2008, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which, among other things, changes disclosure requirements and requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why entities use derivative financial instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This guidance was effective for us as of January 1, 2009. We have included additional disclosures regarding our derivative instruments (see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included herein.) The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In April 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which requires additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods as well as in annual financial statements. This guidance was effective for us as of April 1, 2009. Beginning with our Quarterly Report for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, we have included additional disclosures regarding the fair value of our financial instruments. The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In May 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance, which, among other things, sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should disclose events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date, and the disclosures entities should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. This guidance was effective for us as of June 30, 2009. Beginning with our Quarterly Report for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, we have included additional disclosures regarding our review of subsequent events (see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included herein.) The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Accounting Standards Updates In October 2009, the FASB issued new guidance which establishes accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenue-generating activities. This guidance requires companies to allocate the 49 Table of Contents overall consideration to each deliverable under the arrangement using the estimated selling prices in the absence of vendor specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of selling prices for deliverables. This guidance is effective for any contracts entered into or materially modified after January 1, 2011, with early adoption available. We are evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In January 2010, the FASB issued new guidance which clarifies some of the existing disclosure requirements and adds additional disclosure requirements with respect to fair value measurements. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009. We are evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on our disclosures; however, the adoption of these updates will have no impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long-term debt obligations. We attempt to reduce these risks by utilizing derivative financial instruments, namely interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2009, we held 13 interest rate swap agreements, all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges, and which have an aggregate notional amount of $625.0 million, interest rates ranging from 2.86% to 4.08% and expiration dates through March 2011. In addition, in May 2009, we entered into a foreign currency exchange contract to hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with our acquisition of XCEL. This foreign currency exchange contract was not designated as a hedging instrument and was settled upon the completion of the acquisition of XCEL on May 27, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we repurchased or redeemed approximately $725.1 million face amount of our outstanding debt securities, including the repurchase and redemption of $225.0 million principal amount of our 7.50% Notes, the redemption of $500.0 million principal amount of our 7.125% Notes and the redemption of $0.1 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.00% Notes. As of December 31, 2009, $550.0 million was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan was fully drawn. The following tables provide information as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates. For long-term debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows by maturity date and average interest rates related to outstanding obligations. For interest rate caps and swaps, the tables present notional principal amounts and weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.

As of December 31, 2009, fixed rate debt consists of: the Certificates ($1.75 billion); the 5.0% Notes ($59.7 million) (the 5.0% notes matured on February 15, 2010, and were repaid using cash on hand); the 7.25% Notes ($300.0 million principal amount due at maturity, the balance as of December 31, 2009 is $295.0 million); ATI 7.25% Notes ($0.3 million); the 7.00% senior notes due 2017 (the “7.00% Notes”) ($500.0 million); the XCEL credit facility ($73.4 million); the 4.625% Notes ($600.0 million principal amount due at maturity, the balance as of December 31, 2009 is $599.2 million); and other debt of $59.0 million. Interest on the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan is payable in accordance with the applicable London Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2009 for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan was 2.84%. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the weighted average interest rate under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan was 3.63%. As of December 31, 2008, variable rate debt consists of our Revolving Credit Facility ($750.0 million drawn) and Term Loan ($325.0 million) included above based on the June 8, 2012 maturity date. As of December 31, 2008, fixed rate debt consists of: the Certificates ($1.75 billion); 2.25% convertible notes due 2009 (“2.25% Notes”) ($0.04 million); the 7.125% Notes ($500.0 million principal amount due at maturity; the balance as of December 31, 2008 is $501.1 million); the 5.0% Notes ($59.7 million); the 7.50% Notes ($225.0 million); the ATI 7.25% Notes ($0.3 million); the 3.00% Notes ($162.2 million principal amount due at maturity; the balance as of December 31, 2008 is $161.9 million accreted value); the 7.00% Notes ($500.0 million) and other debt of $60.1 million. Interest on the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan is payable in accordance with the applicable LIBOR agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2008 for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan was 3.20%. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the weighted average interest rate under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan was 4.16%. (b) Includes notional amounts of $150.0 million that expired in December 2009. (c) Includes notional amount of $100.0 million that expires in December 2010. (d) Includes notional amounts of $525.0 million that expire between January and March 2011. (e) Represents the weighted-average fixed rate or range of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts in a given year. (f) The increase in the interest rate is primarily due to the scheduled payments under the XCEL credit facility. Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2009, after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements, was comprised of $200.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility and $50.0 million under the Term Loan. A 10% increase, or approximately 28 basis points, in current interest rates would have caused an additional pre-tax charge to our net income and an increase in our cash outflows of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our foreign operations, including our rental and management segment divisions in Mexico, Brazil and India. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the remeasurement loss from these operations approximated $0.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the remeasurement gain from these operations approximated $5.7 million.",2023-12-30 19:22:53.114282
1053507,AMT,AMERICAN TOWER CORP /MA/,2011,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure in our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements herein and the accompanying notes thereto, and the information set forth under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” beginning on page 40. Management focuses on segment gross margin and segment operating profit as a means to measure operating performance in our business segments. We define segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding: depreciation, amortization and accretion; selling, general, administrative and development expense; and other operating expense. We define segment operating profit as segment gross margin less selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. Segment gross margin and segment operating profit for the rental and management segments also include interest income, TV Azteca, net (see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included herein). These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before interest income, interest expense, loss on retirement of long-term obligations, other income (expense), net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, income (loss) on equity method investments, income taxes and discontinued operations. Executive Overview Our primary business is leasing antenna space on multi-tenant communications sites to wireless service providers and radio and television broadcast companies. We refer to this business as our rental and management operations, which accounted for approximately 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010. Increased expansion activity in international markets and changes to our organizational structure have led us to separately disclose our rental and management operations in two reportable segments: domestic rental and management and international rental and management. Through our network development services segment, we also offer tower-related services domestically, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services, which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. Accordingly, our continuing operations are now reported in three segments, domestic rental and management, international rental and management and network development services. The majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are typically for an initial non-cancellable term of five to ten years, with multiple five-year renewal terms thereafter. Accordingly, nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management operations as of the end of December 2010 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $13.5 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue, absent the impact of straight-line lease accounting. In addition, most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease. These contractual rent escalations are typically annual and based on a fixed percentage (generally three to five percent), inflation, or a fixed percentage plus inflation. Revenue generated by rent increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable term of the applicable agreement. We also routinely seek to extend our tenant leases with our tenants, which increases the non-cancellable term of the lease and creates incremental growth in our revenues. The revenues generated by our rental and management operations may also be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multi-year contracts, which typically may not be cancelled or, in some instances, may be cancelled only upon payment of a termination fee. Accordingly, revenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their 25 Table of Contents terms or rent negotiations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management operations. During the year ended December 31, 2010, loss of annual revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented less than 3% of our rental and management operations revenues. Rental and Management Operations Revenue Growth. The primary factors affecting the consistent incremental growth in our revenues and cash flows for our domestic and international rental and management segments are: • Recurring revenues from tenant leases generated from sites which existed in our portfolio as of the beginning of the prior year period (“legacy sites”); • Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of cancellations; • New revenue generated from leasing additional space on our legacy sites; and • New revenue generated from new sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior year period (“new sites”). We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to meet that demand by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our legacy sites, which increases the utilization and profitability of our sites. In addition, we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless broadband service providers. Our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth. In addition, we intend to continue to supplement the organic growth on our legacy sites by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our return on investment criteria. Rental and Management Operations Organic Revenue Growth. Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our legacy sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our legacy sites. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and, to a lesser extent, the location of and available capacity on our existing sites. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure needs, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital, and general economic conditions. Key trends within each market that we serve provide opportunities for organic revenue growth. • Domestic. The majority of wireless subscribers in the United States currently utilize 3G technology based handsets, for both voice and data applications. As a result of the rapid subscriber adoption of wireless data applications, wireless service providers continue to invest in their 3G networks by adding new cell sites as well as additional equipment to their existing cell sites. This level of wireless communications services growth has produced consistent levels of annual wireless carrier capital investment and as a result, we have experienced consistent demand for our communications sites. In addition, wireless service providers in the United States continue to pursue new avenues for growth, such as deploying 4G technology based wireless networks to provide higher speed data services and enable fixed broadband substitution. As wireless service providers begin to deploy 4G wireless networks, we expect them to overlay 4G equipment across their existing networks of communications sites, resulting in additional revenue. Subsequent to the initial deployment and based on actual subscriber demand, we expect providers to add additional equipment and new communications sites to improve the coverage and capacity of their 4G wireless networks as subscribers transition from 3G handsets. In connection with consistent levels of annual wireless carrier capital investment, this technology migration path has historically provided consistent demand for our communications sites as our tenants migrate their networks from one technology to the next to remain competitive. 26 Table of Contents • International. In general, our international markets are less advanced with respect to the current technologies deployed for wireless services. As a result, demand for our communications sites is driven by continued voice network investments, new market entrants and initial 3G data network deployments. For example, in India, nationwide voice networks continue to be deployed as wireless service providers are beginning their initial investments in 3G data networks, as a result of recent spectrum auctions. In Mexico and Brazil, where nationwide voice networks have been deployed, some incumbent wireless service providers continue to invest in their 3G data networks, and recent spectrum auctions have enabled other incumbent wireless service providers and new market entrants to begin their initial investments in 3G data networks. In markets such as Chile and Peru, recent spectrum auctions have attracted new market entrants, who are expected to begin their investment in deploying nationwide voice and 3G data networks. We believe demand for our tower sites will continue in our international markets as wireless service providers seek to remain competitive by increasing the coverage of their networks while also investing in next generation data networks. Rental and Management Operations New Site Revenue Growth. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we grew our portfolio of communications sites through acquisitions and construction activities, including the acquisition and construction of approximately 7,800 sites. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire larger communications site portfolios, both domestically and internationally, that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing portfolio. New Sites (Acquired or Constructed) 2010 2009 2008 Domestic 947 528 160 International(1) 6,865 3,022 801 (1) The majority of sites acquired or constructed internationally during 2010 and 2009 were in India and our newly launched operations in Chile, Colombia and Peru. Network Development Services Segment Revenue Growth. As we continue to focus on growing our rental and management operations, we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. Through our network development services segment, we offer tower-related services, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services, which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. Rental and Management Operations Expenses. Our rental and management operations expenses include our direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and utilities. These segment level expenses exclude all segment and corporate level selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling, general, administrative and development expense. In general, our rental and management segment level selling, general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow. In geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on materially expanding our site footprint, we may incur additional segment level selling, general and administrative expenses as we increase our presence in these areas. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities. REIT Election. As we review our tax strategy and assess the utilization of our federal and state NOLs, we are actively considering an election to a REIT for U.S. federal and, where applicable, state income tax purposes. We may make the determination to elect REIT status for the taxable year beginning January 1, 2012, as early as the second half of 2011, subject to the approval of our board of directors, although there is no certainty as to the timing of a REIT election or whether we will make a REIT election at all. 27 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Financial Measures Included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (“Adjusted EBITDA”). We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before: income (loss) from discontinued operations, net; income from equity method investments; income tax provision (benefit); other income (expense); loss on retirement of long-term obligations; interest expense; interest income; other operating expenses; depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA is presented as we believe it is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it is the primary measure used by our management team when evaluating the performance of our operating segments, it is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain debt covenants and it is widely used in the tower industry to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved. Our measurement of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, has been included below.

The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in both of our rental and management segments, including organic revenue growth attributable to our legacy sites and revenue growth attributable to the approximately 11,400 new sites that we have constructed or acquired since January 1, 2009. This growth was partially offset by a decrease in network development services segment revenue. Domestic rental and management segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 11% to $1,565.5 million. This growth was comprised of: • Approximately 9% from organic revenue growth, which was due to the incremental revenue generated from adding new tenants to legacy sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to legacy sites, contractual rent escalations and a one-time revenue item, partially offset by tenant lease cancellations and a decline in revenue attributable to a tenant take or pay agreement and settlement from 2009, which did not recur in 2010; and 28 Table of Contents • Revenue growth from new sites of approximately 2%, which was a result of the construction or acquisition of approximately 1,500 new domestic sites since January 1, 2009. International rental and management segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 43% to $370.9 million. This growth was comprised of: • Approximately 8% from organic revenue growth, which was due to the incremental revenue generated from adding new tenants to legacy sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to legacy sites, contractual rent escalations, the positive impact of foreign currency translation and the positive impact from straight-line lease accounting, and was partially offset by tenant lease cancellations and renegotiations with our largest tenant in Mexico; and • Revenue growth from new sites of approximately 35%, which was a result of the construction or acquisition of approximately 9,900 new international sites since January 1, 2009. Network development services segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased 12% to $49.0 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to revenues generated during the year ended December 31, 2009 for a material acquisition, zoning and permitting project with a major tenant, which did not recur in 2010.

The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in both of our rental and management segments and was partially offset by a decrease in gross margin attributable to our network development services segment. Domestic rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 13% to $1,240.1 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue as described above, and was partially offset by a 4% increase in direct operating costs, of which 1% was attributable to expense increases on our legacy domestic sites and 3% was attributable to the incremental direct operating costs associated with the addition of approximately 1,500 new domestic sites since January 1, 2009. International rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 30% to $262.8 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue as described above, and was partially offset by a 70% increase in direct operating costs, including pass-through expenses, of which 10% was attributable to expense increases on our legacy international sites and 60% was attributable to the incremental costs associated with the addition of approximately 9,900 new international sites since January 1, 2009. Network development services segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased 6% to $22.0 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in revenue attributable to our site acquisition, zoning and permitting services. 29 Table of Contents Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense Year EndedDecember 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2010 2009 Rental and management Domestic $ 62,295 $ 55,635 $ 6,660 12 % International 45,877 30,551 15,326 50 Total rental and management 108,172 86,186 21,986 26 Network development services 6,312 5,816 496 9 Other 115,285 109,692 5,593 5 Total selling, general, administrative and development expense $ 229,769 $ 201,694 $ 28,075 14 % Total selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased 14% to $229.8 million. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in both of our rental and management segments and corporate overhead to support the continued growth of our operations. These increases were partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense. Domestic rental and management segment selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 12% to $62.3 million. The increase was primarily attributable to initiatives designed to drive growth and to support a growing portfolio, including increased staffing in field operations, sales and finance, as well as costs associated with establishing a dedicated team to more actively pursue new product lines, such as shared generators and outdoor DAS networks. International rental and management segment selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased 50% to $45.9 million. The increase was primarily attributable to our increased international expansion, including acquisitions of several tower businesses in India, as well as costs associated with our recent expansion initiatives in Chile, Colombia and Peru. Network development services segment selling, general, administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 9% to $6.3 million. The increase was primarily attributable to costs incurred to support our new tower development and our site acquisition, zoning and permitting services. Other selling, general administrative and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased 5% to $115.3 million. The increase was primarily due to a $13.7 million increase in corporate expenses, which were partially offset by a $8.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense. The increase in corporate expenses was primarily attributable to incremental employee and increased information technology costs associated with supporting a growing global organization. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense was primarily attributable to the one-time expense recognized upon the modification of certain equity awards in 2009, which did not recur in 2010.

The increase was primarily attributable to a $5.9 million increase in stock-based compensation expense as a result of a one-time expense recognized upon the modification of certain equity awards in 2009, and was partially offset by a decrease in corporate expenses.

The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in both our rental and management segments gross margin, and was partially offset by increases in total overhead costs attributable to both our rental and management segments as well as our network development services segment. Domestic rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 8% to $1,040.7 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in gross margin (8%) and was partially offset by increases in selling, general, administrative and developmental expense (8%), as described above. International rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 4% to $171.7 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in gross margin (11%), as described above, and was partially offset by increases in selling, general, and administrative and development expense (86%), as described above. Network development services segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 14% to $17.5 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue described above. 35 Table of Contents Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2009 2008 Depreciation, amortization and accretion $ 414,619 $ 405,332 $ 9,287 2 % Depreciation, amortization and accretion for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 2% to $414.6 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the depreciation, amortization and accretion associated with the acquisition or construction of approximately 3,550 sites since January 1, 2009, which resulted in an increase in property and equipment. Other Operating Expenses Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2009 2008 Other operating expenses $ 19,168 $ 11,189 $ 7,979 71 % Other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 71% to $19.2 million. The increase was primarily attributable to approximately $6.3 million in acquisition related costs which were expensed as a result of new accounting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). Approximately $1.2 million of these costs are related to the expensing of amounts which had been recorded as other long-term assets at December 31, 2008 for pending acquisitions and the remaining $5.1 million relates to additional acquisition related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2009. Approximately $1.4 million of the increase was attributable to an increase in impairments and losses on the sale of assets. Interest Expense Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2009 2008 Interest expense $ 249,803 $ 253,584 $ (3,781 ) (1 %) Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009, decreased 1% to $249.8 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in average outstanding debt, partially offset by an increase in our weighted average cost of borrowing to 5.82% from the previous year. Loss on Retirement of Long-term Obligations Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2009 2008 Loss on retirement of long-term obligations $ 18,194 $ 4,904 $ 13,290 271 % Loss on retirement of long-term obligations for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 271% to $18.2 million as a result of amounts paid in excess of carrying value and the write-off of the related deferred financing fees, discounts and premiums. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in refinancing activities during 2009, which included our tender offer and subsequent redemption of $225.0 million principal amount of our 7.50% senior notes due 2012 for an aggregate purchase price of $231.7 million, and our repurchase of an aggregate of $500.0 million principal amount of our 7.125% senior notes due 2012 for an aggregate purchase price of $511.7 million. 36 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2008, holders of approximately $18.3 million principal amount of our 3.25% convertible notes due August 1, 2010 and $182.8 million principal amount of our 3.00% convertible notes due August 15, 2012 converted their notes into shares of our Common Stock. In connection with conversions of a portion of these notes, we paid holders an aggregate of approximately $4.9 million, calculated based on the discounted value of the future interest payments on their notes. Income Tax Provision Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2009 2008 Income tax provision $ 182,565 $ 135,509 $ 47,056 35 % Effective tax rate 43.3 % 36.4 % The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 35% to $182.6 million. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased to 43.3% from 36.4%. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the discrete impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain tax items, IRS audit adjustments and certain valuation allowances, partially offset by the decrease in tax reserves. In addition, the increase in the income tax provision correlates to the increase in income during the year ended December 31, 2009. The effective tax rates on income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 differ from the federal statutory rate due primarily to adjustments for foreign items, non-deductible stock-based compensation expense, IRS audit adjustments of approximately $10.0 million, tax reserves and state taxes. Income from Discontinued Operations, Net Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2009 2008 Income from discontinued operations, net $ 8,179 $ 110,982 $ (102,803 ) (93 %) Income from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased 93% to $8.2 million. This decrease is primarily attributable to the recording of an income tax benefit of $110.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, related to losses associated with our investment in our wholly owned subsidiary, Verestar, Inc. (“Verestar”). Verestar filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in December 2003. During 2007, we settled the litigation related to the Verestar bankruptcy. In April 2008, the bankruptcy court approved Verestar’s plan of liquidation and in December 2008, Verestar was liquidated. The $102.8 million decrease was partially offset by an insurance reimbursement received during the year ended December 31, 2009 for approximately $5.0 million related to the Verestar bankruptcy settlement. 37 Table of Contents Net Income/Adjusted EBITDA Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2009 2008 Net income $ 247,127 $ 347,415 $ (100,288 ) (29 %) Income from discontinued operations, net (8,179 ) (110,982 ) (102,803 ) (93 ) Income from continuing operations 238,948 236,433 2,515 1 Income from equity method investments (26 ) (22 ) 4 18 Income tax provision 182,565 135,509 47,056 35 Other income (1,294 ) (5,988 ) (4,694 ) (78 ) Loss on retirement of long-term obligations 18,194 4,904 13,290 271 Interest expense 249,803 253,584 (3,781 ) (1 ) Interest income (1,722 ) (3,413 ) (1,691 ) (50 ) Other operating expenses 19,168 11,189 7,979 71 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 414,619 405,332 9,287 2 Stock based compensation expense 60,670 54,807 5,863 11 Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,180,925 $ 1,092,335 $ 88,590 8 % Net income for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased 29% to $247.1 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in income from discontinued operations, net from the prior year period, which as described above, was primarily attributable to an income tax benefit recognized in 2008, related to losses associated with our investment in our wholly owned subsidiary, Verestar, Inc. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased 8% to $1,180.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin (9%), and was partially offset by an increase in selling, general, administrative and development expenses (12%). Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview As a holding company, our cash flows are derived primarily from the operations of and distributions from our operating subsidiaries or funds raised through borrowings under our credit facilities and debt and equity offerings. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $1,801.7 million of total liquidity, comprised of approximately $884.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to borrow approximately $917.7 million under our Revolving Credit Facility.

During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we also used our cash flows to refinance our outstanding indebtedness, fund acquisitions and fund our stock repurchase program. Our significant financing transactions in 2010 included the following: • We extended the maturity dates and lowered the cost of our debt by completing two registered offerings of $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.05% Notes and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our 4.50% Notes. • We repurchased approximately 9.3 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $420.8 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to our Buyback. As of December 31, 2010, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $5.6 billion. We generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and cash interest obligations in 2010. We believe our cash generated by operations for the year ending December 31, 2011 also will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and our cash debt service (interest and principal repayments) obligations for 2011. For more information regarding our financing transactions in 2010, see “—Cash Flows from Financing Activities” below. Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash provided by operating activities was $1,021.0 million, an increase of $178.9 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009.

Accordingly, we may continue to acquire communications sites, acquire land under our towers, build or install new communications sites and redevelop or improve existing communications sites when the expected returns on such investments meet our return on investment criteria. We expect that our total capital expenditures will be between approximately $400 million and $450 million in 2011, with spending for capital improvements, corporate expenditures and the redevelopment of existing communications sites at levels comparable to 2010. Additionally, we expect to spend approximately $80 million to $100 million for ground lease purchases and $200 million to $220 million for other capital projects including the construction of approximately 1,200 to 1,500 new communications sites.

Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2010, we had $300.0 million outstanding and the ability to borrow approximately $917.7 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. We continue to maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility in the ordinary course. 40 Table of Contents The borrower under the Revolving Credit Facility is American Tower Corporation. The Revolving Credit Facility has a term of five years and matures on June 8, 2012. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The Revolving Credit Facility does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. The Revolving Credit Facility allows us to use borrowings for our and our subsidiaries’ working capital needs and other general corporate purposes (including, without limitation, to refinance or repurchase other indebtedness and, provided certain conditions are met, to repurchase our equity securities and make other distributions to shareholders, in each case without additional lender approval). Term Loan. On March 24, 2008, we entered into the $325.0 million Term Loan pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility. At closing, we received net proceeds of approximately $321.7 million from the Term Loan, which, together with available cash, we used to repay $325.0 million of existing indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Term Loan is governed by the terms of the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility. Consistent with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, the borrower under the Term Loan is American Tower Corporation, and the maturity date for the Term Loan is June 8, 2012. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The Term Loan does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. Senior Notes Offerings. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we completed registered public offerings of our $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.05% Notes and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our 4.50% Notes. The net proceeds from the 5.05% Notes offering were approximately $693.6 million, after deducting commissions and expenses. We used $575.0 million of the net proceeds to repay certain of our outstanding indebtedness incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility, which, along with cash on hand, was used to finance international acquisitions. The remainder of the net proceeds was used for general corporate purposes. The net proceeds from the 4.50% Notes offering were approximately $991.9 million, after deducting commissions and expenses. We used a portion of the net proceeds to repay certain of our outstanding indebtedness incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility and have used and will use a portion of the net proceeds to finance international acquisitions.

If we undergo a change of control and ratings decline (in the event that on or within 90 days after an announcement of a change of control, both of our current investment grade credit ratings cease to be investment grade), each as defined in the supplemental indenture for the 5.05% Notes and 4.50% Notes, we will be required to offer to repurchase all of the 5.05% Notes and 4.50% Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if any) up to but not including the repurchase date. The 5.05% Notes and 4.50% Notes rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured debt and 41 Table of Contents are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries. Each supplemental indenture contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and our ability and our subsidiaries’ abilities to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that we may incur certain liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness, if the aggregate amount of such liens does not exceed 3.5x Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in each supplemental indenture. XCEL Credit Facility. At the time of our acquisition of XCEL on May 27, 2009, a 4.8 billion Indian Rupee-denominated credit facility (“XCEL Credit Facility”) was in place, of which 3.4 billion Indian Rupees (approximately $77.3 million) was outstanding. In April 2010, we repaid all of the outstanding indebtedness incurred under the XCEL Credit Facility and terminated the XCEL Credit Facility upon repayment. ETIPL Debt—At the time of our acquisition of ETIPL on August 6, 2010, ETIPL had in place term loans principally denominated in Indian Rupees in an amount equal to approximately 6.5 billion Indian Rupees and a working capital loan in an amount equal to approximately 297.5 million Indian Rupees (“ETIPL Debt”) (approximately $147.8 million). In October 2010, we repaid and terminated all of the outstanding ETIPL Debt. Colombian Short-Term Credit Facility—In connection with the purchase of the exclusive use rights for 508 towers from Colombia Telecomunicaciones S.A. E.S.P. (“Coltel”), we entered into a 72.8 billion Colombian Peso-denominated revolving credit facility on September 3, 2010. On November 24, 2010, we increased the revolving credit facility by 66.3 billion Colombian Pesos. As of December 31, 2010, we had 139.1 billion Colombian Pesos (approximately $72.9 million) outstanding under this credit facility. This initial credit facility matures on March 2, 2011 and the supplemental credit facility matures on May 26, 2011. Stock Repurchase Program. In 2010, we continued to repurchase shares of our Common Stock pursuant to our Buyback. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we repurchased 9.3 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate of $420.8 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the Buyback. As of December 31, 2010, we had repurchased 29.8 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate of $1.2 billion, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the Buyback. In the near term, we expect to fund any further repurchases of our Common Stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Purchases under the Buyback are subject to us having available cash to fund repurchases. Under the Buyback, we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. To facilitate repurchases, we purchase our Common Stock pursuant to trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, which allow us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. Between January 1, 2011 and February 11, 2011, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate of $58.0 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the Buyback. As of February 11, 2011, we had repurchased a total of 30.9 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate of $1.2 billion, including commissions and fees pursuant to the Buyback. We expect to continue to manage the pacing of the remaining $273.1 million under the Buyback in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors. Sales of Equity Securities. We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plans and upon exercise of warrants to purchase our equity securities. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we received an aggregate of $138.5 million in proceeds from sales of shares pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, upon exercises of stock options and upon exercises of warrants. 42 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations.

For the Revolving Credit Facility, the interest rate ranges between 0.40% and 1.25% above the applicable LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.00% and 0.25% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on our debt ratings. For the Term Loan, the interest rate ranges between 0.50% and 1.50% above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.00% and 0.50% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on our debt ratings. A quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the Revolving Credit Facility is required, ranging from 0.08% to 0.25% per annum, based on our debt ratings. As discussed in Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” we have entered into swap agreements to manage exposure to variable rate interest obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan. As a result of these swap agreements, the effective weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2010 for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan was 3.10%. For projections of our cash interest expense related to the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan, we have assumed the LIBOR rate before the margin, as defined in the loan agreement, is 0.25% through its maturity on June 8, 2012. (2) The Colombian Short-Term Credit Facility is denominated in Colombian Pesos and was entered into in connection with the purchase of the exclusive use rights for 508 towers from Coltel. 43 Table of Contents (3) Operating lease payments include payments to be made under non-cancellable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that we will renew the lease. (4) Primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other long-term liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily our straight-line rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash. (5) Other long-term liabilities exclude $26.0 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and $18.0 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled. Settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe. However, based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements, we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Refinancing Activities Redemption of ATI 7.25% Senior Subordinated Notes—During the year ended December 31, 2010, ATI issued a notice for the redemption of the remaining $0.3 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.25% senior subordinated notes due 2011 (“ATI 7.25% Notes”). In accordance with the redemption provisions and the indenture for the ATI 7.25% Notes, the remaining ATI 7.25% Notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100.00% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, September 23, 2010, for an aggregate purchase price of $0.3 million. Upon completion of this redemption, none of the ATI 7.25% Notes remained outstanding. Interest Rate Swap Agreements. As of December 31, 2010, we held 12 interest rate swap agreements, all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges, and which have an aggregate notional amount of $525.0 million, interest rates ranging from 2.86% to 3.74% and expiration dates through March 2011. As of December 31, 2009, we held 13 interest rate swaps, which had an aggregate notional amount of $625.0 million, to manage exposure to variability in cash flows relating to forecasted interest payments under our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan. During the year ended December 31, 2010, one of the contracts matured. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Internally Generated Funds. Because the majority of our tenant leases are multi-year contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management operations as of the end of 2010 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites. Restrictions Under Loan Agreement Relating to Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan. The loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan contains certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and all of our subsidiaries designated as restricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guarantees, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreement also contains covenants that establish three financial tests with 44 Table of Contents which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage, senior secured leverage and interest coverage, as set forth below. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. • Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the loan agreement) of 6.00 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, we could incur approximately $2.23 billion of additional indebtedness and still remain in compliance with this ratio. In addition, if we maintain our existing debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $372 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. • Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of Senior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the loan agreement) of 3.00 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, we could incur approximately $2.14 billion of additional Senior Secured Debt and still remain in compliance with this ratio. In addition, if we maintain our existing Senior Secured Debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $714 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. • Interest Coverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we maintain a ratio of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the loan agreement) to Interest Expense of not less than 2.50 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, our interest expense, which was $237 million for that period, could increase by approximately $285 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. In addition, if our interest expense does not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $713 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. The loan agreement also contains reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants. Any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the facility, but would constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next twelve months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. Restrictions Under Loan Agreement Relating to Securitization. The loan agreement related to the Securitization involved assets related to 5,295 broadcast and wireless communications towers owned by two special purpose subsidiaries of the Company (the “Borrowers”), through a private offering of $1.75 billion of Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-1 (the “Certificates”). The Securitization loan agreement includes certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the Borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. The Borrowers’ organizational documents contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities, including the requirement that the Borrowers maintain at least two independent directors. The Securitization loan agreement also contains certain covenants that require the Borrowers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets, promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the Securitization 45 Table of Contents loan agreement and other agreements related to the towers subject to the Securitization, and allow the trustee reasonable access to the towers, including the right to conduct site investigations. Under the terms of the Securitization loan agreement, the loan will be paid solely from the cash flows generated by the towers subject to the Securitization, which must be deposited, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the Securitization loan. The Borrowers are required to make monthly payments of interest on the Securitization loan. On a monthly basis, all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the Securitization loan, referred to as excess cash flow, is to be released to the Borrowers for distribution to us. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Borrowers distributed excess cash to us of approximately $444.0 million. In order to distribute this excess cash flow to us, the Borrowers must maintain several specified ratios with respect to their debt service coverage (“DSCR”). For this purpose, DSCR is tested as of the last day of each calendar quarter and is generally defined as four times the Borrowers’ net cash flow for that quarter divided by the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees that the Borrowers must pay over the succeeding twelve months on the Securitization loan. Pursuant to one such test, if the DSCR as of the end of any calendar quarter were: • 1.30x or less, during the five-year period commencing on the closing date of the Securitization in May 2007, or • 1.75x or less, thereafter, (1.30x or 1.75x as applicable, the “Cash Trap DSCR”), then all excess cash flow would be placed in a reserve account and would not be released to the Borrowers for distribution to us until the DSCR exceeded the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. Additionally, while principal payments generally are not due with respect to any component of the Securitization loan until April 2014, excess cash flow would be applied to principal during an “Amortization Period” under the Securitization loan until April 2014. An “Amortization Period” would commence under the Securitization loan if the DSCR as of the end of any calendar quarter fell below: • 1.15x, during the five-year period commencing on the closing date of the Securitization in May 2007, or • 1.45x thereafter (1.15x or 1.45x as applicable, the “Minimum DSCR”). In such a case, all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve account because the Cash Trap DSCR was not met would be applied to pay principal of the Securitization loan on each monthly payment date until the DSCR exceeded the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Consequently, a failure to comply with the covenants in the Securitization loan agreement could prevent the Borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers. Additionally, a failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent the Borrowers from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our discretionary expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions, and our stock repurchase program. In addition, if the Borrowers were to default on the loan related to the Securitization, the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the Securitization, in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers. As of December 31, 2010, the Borrowers’ DSCR was 3.34x. Based on the Borrowers’ net cash flow for the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2010 and the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the Securitization loan, the Borrowers could endure a reduction of approximately $201.0 million in net cash flow before triggering a Cash Trap DSCR, and approximately $215.8 million in net cash flow before triggering an Amortization Period. 46 Table of Contents As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness. In addition, in order to fund future growth and expansion initiatives and fund our stock repurchase program, we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities. If we determined that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund future growth expansion initiatives, refinance our existing indebtedness or fund our stock repurchase program. In addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under the caption “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and, consequently, a failure by a significant customer to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to impairment of assets (including goodwill), asset retirement obligations, acquisitions, revenue recognition, rent expense, stock-based compensation and income taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2010. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. • Impairment of Assets—Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization: We review long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable. We review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indications of impairment on an individual tower basis, which primarily result from a tower not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. A cashflow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy. To the extent that cash flows generated under this approach are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the towers, the towers and network location intangible assets are impaired. We monitor our customer related intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indications of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts, or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the customer related intangible assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows. If we determine that the carrying value of the customer related intangible asset may not be recoverable, we measure any impairment based on the fair value of the 47 Table of Contents asset as determined by the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset, as compared to the asset’s carrying value. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment. • Impairment of Assets—Goodwill—Assets Not Subject to Amortization: We review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. As a result of our recent expansion into international markets and changes to our organization structure, we have concluded that our rental and management operations are comprised of two reportable segments: domestic rental and management and international rental and management. Although our reportable segments have changed, there has been no change to the reporting units (which are at a level below that of our reportable segments) used for testing goodwill. All of our goodwill is recorded in our domestic and international rental and management segments. We utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment. When conducting this test, we employ a discounted cash flow analysis, corroborated by a peer group and market valuation analysis. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results, the current weighted average cost of capital, and a current tax rate. Under the first step of this test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying value of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we conduct the second step of this test, in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized. During the year ended December 31, 2010, no impairment was determined under the first step of the test, as the fair value of the respective reporting units is substantially in excess of their carrying values. We performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that none of the following negative changes in our assumptions individually, which we determined to be reasonable, would impact our conclusions: • Domestic rental and management reporting unit: A 15% reduction in projected net income, or 200 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital, or a 15% reduction in terminal sales growth rate. • International rental and management reporting units: A 3% reduction in projected net income, or 60 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital, or a 12% reduction in terminal sales growth rate. • Asset Retirement Obligations: We recognize asset retirement obligations associated with our legal obligation to retire tangible long-lived assets and the related asset retirement costs, which are principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of our tower assets are located, in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made, and we accrete such liability through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. The associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets and depreciated over their estimated useful life. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of $3.3 million and a net decrease in the estimated obligation of $2.2 million, respectively. The increase in 2010 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows, and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense. The significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset 48 Table of Contents retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary. • Acquisitions: For those acquisitions that meet the criteria of a business combination, we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, including any contingent consideration, at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition with any excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. For those acquisitions that do not meet the criteria of a business combination, we first allocate the purchase price to property and equipment for the fair value of the towers and to identifiable intangible assets (primarily acquired customer base and network location intangibles). The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future customer cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition. The determination of the final purchase price and allocation may extend over more than one period and result in adjustments to the preliminary estimate recognized. • Revenue Recognition: Rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned and when collectability is reasonably assured, regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts. Fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease agreements, excluding those tied to the Consumer Price Index or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our customers are recognized on a straight-line basis over the fixed, non-cancellable terms of the applicable leases. Total rental and management straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 approximated $105.2 million, $36.3 million and $50.4 million, respectively. Amounts billed up-front for certain services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases. Amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until the earnings process is complete. We derive the largest portion of our revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of customers in the telecommunications industry, and approximately 59% of our revenues are derived from four customers in the industry. In addition, we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. We mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of our borrowers and customers. In recognizing customer revenue we must assess the collectability of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes customer credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectability of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved. Any amounts which were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense. Accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a customer’s inability to make required payments and reserves for amounts invoiced whose collectability is not reasonably assured. • Rent Expense: Many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time. We calculate straight-line ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us 49 Table of Contents such that renewal appears, at the inception of the lease, to be reasonably assured. Certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease, if the tenant exercises its renewal option. For towers with these types of tenant leases at the inception of the ground lease, we calculate our straight-line ground rent over the term of the ground lease, including all renewal options required to fulfill the tenant lease obligation. In addition to the straight-line ground rent expense recorded, we also record an associated straight-line rent liability in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Leases may contain complex terms that often are subject to interpretation. • Stock-Based Compensation: We measure stock-based compensation cost at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and the fair value is recognized as an expense over the service period, which generally represents the vesting period. The expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will not fully vest and be forfeited. The fair value of a stock option is determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that takes into account a number of assumptions at the accounting measurement date including the stock price, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock, expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. These assumptions are highly subjective and could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the compensation expense. The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our Common Stock on the grant date. • Income Taxes: Accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes. To the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for book purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax purposes deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns, which may differ from the current rate. We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2010, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $48.2 million which primarily relates to state net operating loss carryforwards, equity investments and foreign items. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards, as we believe that we will have sufficient taxable income to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty-year tax carryforward period. Valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability. The recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing projections based on our current operations. The projections show a significant decrease in depreciation in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations, material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $0.3 billion and $0.4 billion in federal and state taxable income, respectively, from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2030. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future, we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination, 50 Table of Contents which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe, or if the applicable statute of limitations lapses. We believe that the amount of the change could range from zero to $3.0 million. As of December 31, 2010, we have classified approximately $26.0 million as other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. We also classified approximately $18.0 million of accrued income tax-related interest and penalties as other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2010. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws, regulations and administrative practices in a multitude of jurisdictions across our operations. From time to time, we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations, and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. We believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December 31, 2010. Accounting Standards Updates In October 2009, the FASB issued new guidance which establishes accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenue-generating activities. This guidance allows companies to allocate the overall consideration to each deliverable under the arrangement using the estimated selling prices in the absence of vendor specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of selling price for deliverables. This guidance is effective for any contracts entered into, or materially modified after January 1, 2011. We do not anticipate this update will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. 51 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long-term debt obligations. We attempt to reduce these risks by utilizing derivative financial instruments, namely interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2010, we held 12 interest rate swap agreements, all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges, and which have an aggregate notional amount of $525.0 million, interest rates ranging from 2.86% to 3.74% and expiration dates through March 2011. In addition, in May 2009, we entered into a foreign currency exchange contract to hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with our acquisition of XCEL. This foreign currency exchange contract was not designated as a hedging instrument and was settled upon the completion of the acquisition of XCEL on May 27, 2009. The settlement resulted in a gain of approximately $1.7 million, which is reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2010, ATI redeemed approximately $0.3 million principal amount of the ATI 7.25% Notes and we repaid $59.7 million of the 5.0% convertible notes due 2010 and the outstanding balance of the XCEL Credit Facility (approximately $77.3 million). In addition, in August and December of 2010, we completed registered public offerings of $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.05% senior notes due 2020 (“5.05% Notes”) and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our 4.50% senior notes due 2018 (“4.50% Notes”). As of December 31, 2010, $300.0 million was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan was fully drawn. The following tables provide information as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates. For long-term debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows by maturity date and average interest rates related to outstanding obligations. For interest rate caps and swaps, the tables present notional principal amounts and weighted-average interest rates by contractual maturity dates.

Interest on the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan is payable in accordance with the applicable LIBOR agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2009 for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan was 2.84%. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the weighted average interest rate under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan was 3.63%. (b) Includes notional amounts of $100.0 million that expired in December 2010. (c) Includes notional amounts of $525.0 million that expire between January and March 2011. (d) Represents the weighted-average fixed rate or range of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts in a given year. Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2010, after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements, was comprised of $50.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility and $50.0 under the Term Loan. A 10% increase, or 31 basis points, in current interest rates would have caused an additional pre-tax charge to our net income and an increase in our cash outflows of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar is reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in stockholders’ equity and as a component of comprehensive income. For the year ended December 31, 2010, approximately 19% of our total revenues and approximately 24% of our operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies, as compared to 15% and 19% respectively, during the same period in 2009. 53 Table of Contents We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our revenue, operating results or cash flows.",2023-12-30 19:23:01.221111
1053507,AMT,AMERICAN TOWER CORP /MA/,2012,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure in our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements herein and the accompanying notes thereto, and the information set forth under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” beginning on page 54. Our continuing operations are reported in three segments, domestic rental and management, international rental and management and network and development services. Management focuses on segment gross margin and segment operating profit as a means to measure operating performance in our business segments. We define segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation recorded in costs of operations; depreciation, amortization and accretion; selling, general, administrative and development expense; and other operating expense. We define segment operating profit as segment gross margin less selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. Segment gross margin and segment operating profit for the rental and management segments also include interest income, TV Azteca, net (see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included herein). These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before interest income, interest expense, loss on retirement of long-term obligations, other income (expense), net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, income (loss) on equity method investments, income taxes and discontinued operations. Executive Overview Our primary business is leasing antenna space on multi-tenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. We also manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We refer to this business as our rental and management operations, which accounted for approximately 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 and include our domestic rental and management segment and our international rental and management segment. Through our network development services segment, we offer tower-related services domestically, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services, which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. We began operating as a REIT for federal income tax purposes effective January 1, 2012. The following table details the number of communications sites we own or operate in the countries in which we operate as of December 31, 2011: Country Number of Owned orOperated Sites United States 21,575 International: Brazil 2,505 Chile 1,142 Colombia 2,677 Ghana 1,872 India 8,801 Mexico 5,067 Peru 475 South Africa 1,364 30 Table of Contents The majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are typically for an initial non-cancellable term of five to ten years, with multiple five-year renewal terms thereafter. Accordingly, nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended December 31, 2011 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. The tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2011, will generate approximately $18.5 billion of non-cancellable future tenant lease revenue, absent the impact of straight-line lease accounting. In addition, most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease. These contractual rent escalations are typically annual and based on a fixed percentage (on average approximately 3.5% in the U.S.), inflation, or a fixed percentage plus inflation. Revenue generated by rent increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable term of the applicable agreement. We also routinely seek to extend our leases with our tenants, which increases the non-cancellable term of the lease and creates incremental growth in our revenues. The revenues generated by our rental and management operations may also be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multi-year contracts, which typically may not be cancelled or, in some instances, may be cancelled only upon payment of a termination fee. Accordingly, revenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their terms or rent negotiations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management operations. During the year ended December 31, 2011, loss of annual revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented less than 2% of our rental and management operations revenues. Rental and Management Operations Revenue Growth. The primary factors affecting the consistent revenue and incremental growth for our domestic and international rental and management segments are new revenue generated from new sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior year period (“new sites”) and organic revenue growth, which consists of: • Recurring revenues from tenant leases generated from sites which existed in our portfolio as of the beginning of the prior year period (“legacy sites”); • Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of cancellations; and • New revenue generated from leasing additional space on our legacy sites. We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to meet that demand by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our legacy sites, which increases the utilization and profitability of our sites. In addition, we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers. Our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth. In addition, we intend to continue to supplement the organic growth on our legacy sites by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our return on investment criteria. Rental and Management Operations Organic Revenue Growth. Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our legacy sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our legacy sites. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure needs, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions. The following key trends within each market that we serve provide opportunities for organic revenue growth: • Domestic. The majority of wireless subscribers in the United States currently utilize 3G technology based handsets, for both voice and data applications. As a result of the rapid subscriber adoption of wireless data applications, wireless service providers continue to invest in their 3G networks by adding 31 Table of Contents new cell sites as well as additional equipment to their existing cell sites. This level of wireless communications services growth has produced consistent levels of annual wireless carrier capital investment and as a result, we have experienced consistent demand for our communications sites. In addition, wireless service providers in the United States continue to pursue new avenues for growth, such as deploying 4G technology based wireless networks to provide higher speed data services and enable fixed broadband substitution. As wireless service providers begin to deploy 4G wireless networks, we expect them to overlay 4G equipment across their existing networks of communications sites, resulting in additional revenue. Subsequent to the initial deployment and based on actual subscriber demand, we expect providers to add additional equipment and new communications sites to improve the coverage and capacity of their 4G wireless networks as subscribers transition from 3G handsets. In connection with consistent levels of annual wireless carrier capital investment, this technology migration has historically provided consistent demand for our communications sites as our tenants migrate from one technology to the next to remain competitive. • International. In general, our international markets are less advanced with respect to the current technologies deployed for wireless services. As a result, demand for our communications sites is driven by continued voice network investments, new market entrants and initial 3G data network deployments. For example, in India, nationwide voice networks continue to be deployed as wireless service providers are beginning their investments in 3G data networks. Similarly, in Ghana, wireless service providers continue to build out their voice and data networks in order to satisfy increasing demand for wireless services. In South Africa, where voice networks are in a more advanced stage of development, carriers are beginning to deploy 3G data networks across spectrum from recent spectrum auctions. In Mexico and Brazil, where nationwide voice networks have also been deployed, some incumbent wireless service providers continue to invest in their 3G data networks, and recent spectrum auctions have enabled other incumbent wireless service providers and new market entrants to begin their initial investments in 3G data networks. In markets such as Chile, Peru and Colombia, recent or anticipated spectrum auctions are expected to drive investment in nationwide voice and 3G data networks. We believe demand for our tower sites will continue in our international markets as wireless service providers seek to remain competitive by increasing the coverage of their networks while also investing in next generation data networks. Rental and Management Operations New Site Revenue Growth. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we grew our portfolio of communications sites through acquisitions and construction activities, including the acquisition and construction of approximately 10,470 sites. In addition, in 2011 we also acquired property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators under approximately 1,810 communications sites. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire larger communications site portfolios, both domestically and internationally, to determine whether they meet our risk adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio. New Sites (Acquired or Constructed) 2011 2010 2009 Domestic 470 950 530 International(1) 10,000 6,870 3,020 (1) The majority of sites acquired or constructed in 2011 were in Brazil, Colombia, Ghana, India, Mexico and South Africa; in 2010 were in Chile, Colombia, India and Peru; and in 2009 were in Brazil and India. Network Development Services Segment Revenue Growth. As we continue to focus on growing our rental and management operations, we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. Through our network development services segment, we offer tower-related services, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services, which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. 32 Table of Contents Rental and Management Operations Expenses. Our rental and management operations expenses include our direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent, property taxes, repairs and maintenance and power and fuel costs, some of which may be passed through to our customers. These segment level expenses exclude all segment and corporate level selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling, general, administrative and development expense. In general, our rental and management segment level selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow. In geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on materially expanding our site footprint, we may incur additional segment level selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in these areas. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities. REIT Conversion. Effective January 1, 2012, we reorganized our operations to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. The REIT tax rules require that we derive most of our income, other than income generated by a TRS, from investments in real estate, which for us will primarily consist of income from the leasing of our communications sites. A REIT is not permitted to retain earnings and profits accumulated either during the years it was taxed as a C corporation or by its TRSs that have been converted to qualified REIT subsidiaries, and must make one or more distributions to stockholders that equal or exceed that accumulated amount. In December 2011, we paid the Pre-REIT Distribution to our stockholders of approximately $137.8 million. We intend to commence paying regular distributions in 2012. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions, however, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will be declared based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain REIT status and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset, in whole or in part, our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. For more information on the requirements to qualify as a REIT, see Item 1 of this Annual Report under the caption “Business—Overview,” and Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors—Failure to make required distributions would subject us to additional federal corporate income tax, which may limit our ability to fund these distributions using cash generated through our TRSs” and “—Certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes, which reduce our cash flows, and will have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities.” Non-GAAP Financial Measures Included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (“Adjusted EBITDA”). We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before: income (loss) on discontinued operations, net; income (loss) from equity method investments; income tax provision (benefit); other income (expense); loss on retirement of long-term obligations; interest expense; interest income; other operating expenses; depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA is presented as we believe it is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) it is the primary measure used by our management team for purposes of decision making and for evaluating the performance of our operating segments; (2) it is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain debt covenants; (3) it is widely used in the 33 Table of Contents tower industry to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4) it provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period to period operating performance by eliminating items which are not operational in nature; and (5) it provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of different companies by excluding the impact of long-term strategic decisions which can differ significantly from company to company, such as decisions with respect to capital structure, capital investments and the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate. Our measurement of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, has been included below. Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (In thousands) Revenue Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2011 2010 Rental and management Domestic $ 1,744,260 $ 1,565,474 $ 178,786 11 % International 641,925 370,899 271,026 73 Total rental and management 2,386,185 1,936,373 449,812 23 Network development services 57,347 48,962 8,385 17 Total revenues $ 2,443,532 $ 1,985,335 $ 458,197 23 % Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 23% to $2,443.5 million. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in both of our rental and management segments, including organic revenue growth attributable to our legacy sites and revenue growth attributable to the approximately 18,290 new communications sites, and property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators under approximately 1,810 communications sites, acquired since January 1, 2010. Domestic rental and management segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 11% to $1,744.3 million. This growth was comprised of: • Approximately 9% from organic revenue growth, which was due to the incremental revenue generated from adding new tenants to legacy sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to legacy sites, contractual rent escalations, and a positive impact from straight-line lease accounting due to extending thousands of leases with one of our major tenants, partially offset by tenant lease cancellations; and • Revenue growth of approximately 2%, which was a result of the construction or acquisition of approximately 1,420 new domestic communications sites and the acquisition of property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators under approximately 1,810 communications sites since January 1, 2010. International rental and management segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 73% to $641.9 million. This growth was comprised of: • Approximately 9% from organic revenue growth, which was due to the incremental revenue generated from adding new tenants to legacy sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to legacy sites, 34 Table of Contents contractual rent escalations, a decrease in revenue reserves, the positive impact of foreign currency translation and the positive impact from straight-line lease accounting, and was partially offset by tenant lease cancellations; and • Revenue growth from new sites of approximately 64%, which was a result of the construction or acquisition of approximately 16,870 new international sites since January 1, 2010. Network development services segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 17% to $57.3 million. The increase was primarily attributable to a number of favorable one-time items.

The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue as described above, and was partially offset by a 9% increase in direct operating costs, of which 6% was attributable to expense increases on our legacy domestic sites and 3% was attributable to the incremental direct operating costs associated with the addition of approximately 1,420 new domestic sites since January 1, 2010. International rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 60% to $420.4 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue as described above, and was partially offset by a 93% increase in direct operating costs, including pass-through expenses, of which 9% was attributable to expense increases on our legacy international sites and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and 84% was attributable to the incremental direct operating costs associated with the addition of approximately 16,870 new international sites since January 1, 2010. Network development services segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 27% to $27.9 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in nonrecurring revenue described above.

The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in both of our rental and management segments. Domestic rental and management segment SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 24% to $77.0 million. The increase was primarily attributable to initiatives designed to drive growth and to support a growing portfolio, including increased staffing in field operations, sales and finance, and other functions supporting the expansion of our business. International rental and management segment SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 79% to $82.1 million. The increase was primarily attributable to our increased international expansion initiatives in our foreign operations. Network development services segment SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 25% to $7.9 million. The increase was primarily attributable to costs incurred to support our new tower development and our site acquisition, zoning and permitting services. Other SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 6% to $121.8 million. The increase was primarily due to a $14.0 million increase in corporate expenses, which was partially offset by a $7.4 million decrease in SG&A related stock-based compensation expense. The increase in corporate expenses was primarily attributable to incremental employee and increased information technology costs associated with supporting a growing global organization. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense was primarily attributable to the capitalization of approximately $3.1 million, which is now included in property and equipment as part of our cost to construct tower assets, and the recognition of approximately $2.3 million in costs of operations during the year ended December 31, 2011.

The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our domestic rental and management segment gross margin (12%) as described above, and was partially offset by increases in our domestic rental and management segment SG&A (24%), as described above. International rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 56% to $338.3 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our international rental and management segment gross margin (60%) as described above, and was partially offset by increases in our international rental and management segment SG&A (79%), as described above. Network development services segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 28% to $20.0 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in gross margin as described above. 36 Table of Contents Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2011 2010 Depreciation, amortization and accretion $ 555,517 $ 460,726 $ 94,791 21 % Depreciation, amortization and accretion for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 21% to $555.5 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the depreciation, amortization and accretion associated with the acquisition or construction of approximately 18,290 sites since January 1, 2010, which resulted in an increase in property and equipment. Other Operating Expenses Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2011 2010 Other operating expenses $ 58,103 $ 35,876 $ 22,227 62 % Other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 62% to $58.1 million. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately $21.5 million in acquisition related costs, including contingent consideration, and consulting and legal costs associated with our REIT Conversion that are non-recurring in nature. Interest Expense Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2011 2010 Interest expense $ 311,854 $ 246,018 $ 65,836 27 % Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 27% to $311.9 million. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in average debt outstanding of approximately $1.4 billion, primarily attributable to our recent acquisitions, partially offset by a reduction in our annualized weighted average cost of borrowing from 5.52% to 5.32%. Other (Expense) Income Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2011 2010 Other (expense) income $ (122,975 ) $ 315 $ (123,290 ) N/A During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded unrealized foreign currency losses resulting primarily from fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates associated with our intercompany notes and similar unaffiliated balances denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies of approximately $131.1 million and other miscellaneous income of $8.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded unrealized foreign currency gains of approximately $4.8 million and other miscellaneous expense of $4.5 million. 37 Table of Contents Income Tax Provision Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2011 2010 Income tax provision $ 125,080 $ 182,489 $ (57,409 ) (31 )% Effective tax rate 24.7 % 32.8 % The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased 31% to $125.1 million. The effective tax rate (“ETR”) for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased to 24.7% from 32.8%. The decrease in ETR during the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily attributable to the impact of our reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities for assets and liabilities no longer subject to income taxes at the REIT level of $121 million, which was partially offset by an increase in the income tax provision from continuing operations. The ETRs on income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 differ from the federal statutory rate primarily attributable to adjustments for foreign items, non-deductible stock-based compensation expense, tax reserves and state taxes.

The increase was primarily attributable to increases in our rental and management and network development services segment operating profit, as described above, partially offset by an increase in other expense (income), depreciation, amortization and accretion and interest expense. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 18% to $1,595.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our rental and management segments gross margin and network development services segment gross margin, and was partially offset by an increase in selling, general, administrative and development expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense. 38 Table of Contents Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (In thousands) Revenue Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2010 2009 Rental and management Domestic $ 1,565,474 $ 1,408,352 $ 157,122 11 % International 370,899 260,068 110,831 43 Total rental and management 1,936,373 1,668,420 267,953 16 Network development services 48,962 55,694 (6,732 ) (12 ) Total revenues $ 1,985,335 $ 1,724,114 $ 261,221 15 % Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 15% to $1,985.3 million. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in both of our rental and management segments, including organic revenue growth attributable to our legacy sites and revenue growth attributable to the approximately 11,400 new sites that we have constructed or acquired since January 1, 2009. This growth was partially offset by a decrease in network development services segment revenue. Domestic rental and management segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 11% to $1,565.5 million. This growth was comprised of: • Approximately 9% from organic revenue growth, which was due to the incremental revenue generated from adding new tenants to legacy sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to legacy sites, contractual rent escalations and a one-time revenue item, partially offset by tenant lease cancellations and a decline in revenue attributable to a tenant take or pay agreement and settlement from 2009, which did not recur in 2010; and • Revenue growth from new sites of approximately 2%, which was a result of the construction or acquisition of approximately 1,500 new domestic sites since January 1, 2009. International rental and management segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 43% to $370.9 million. This growth was comprised of: • Approximately 8% from organic revenue growth, which was due to the incremental revenue generated from adding new tenants to legacy sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to legacy sites, contractual rent escalations, the positive impact of foreign currency translation and the positive impact from straight-line lease accounting, and was partially offset by tenant lease cancellations and renegotiations with our largest tenant in Mexico; and • Revenue growth from new sites of approximately 35%, which was a result of the construction or acquisition of approximately 9,900 new international sites since January 1, 2009. Network development services segments revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased 12% to $49.0 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to revenues generated during the year ended December 31, 2009 for a material acquisition, zoning and permitting project with a major tenant, which did not recur in 2010. 39 Table of Contents Gross Margin Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2010 2009 Rental and management Domestic $ 1,240,114 $ 1,096,350 $ 143,764 13 % International 262,842 202,290 60,552 30 Total rental and management 1,502,956 1,298,640 204,316 16 Network development services 22,005 23,309 (1,304 ) (6 ) Domestic rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 13% to $1,240.1 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue as described above, and was partially offset by a 4% increase in direct operating costs, of which 1% was attributable to expense increases on our legacy domestic sites and 3% was attributable to the incremental direct operating costs associated with the addition of approximately 1,500 new domestic sites since January 1, 2009. International rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 30% to $262.8 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue as described above, and was partially offset by a 70% increase in direct operating costs, including pass-through expenses, of which 10% was attributable to expense increases on our legacy international sites and 60% was attributable to the incremental costs associated with the addition of approximately 9,900 new international sites since January 1, 2009. Network development services segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased 6% to $22.0 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in revenue attributable to our site acquisition, zoning and permitting services.

The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in both of our rental and management segments and corporate overhead to support the continued growth of our operations. These increases were partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense. Domestic rental and management SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 12% to $62.3 million. The increase was primarily attributable to initiatives designed to drive growth and to support a growing portfolio, including increased staffing in field operations, sales and finance, as well as costs associated with establishing a dedicated team to more actively pursue new product lines, such as shared generators and outdoor DAS networks. 40 Table of Contents International rental and management SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased 50% to $45.9 million. The increase was primarily attributable to our increased international expansion, including acquisitions of several tower businesses in India, as well as costs associated with our recent expansion initiatives in Chile, Colombia and Peru. Network development SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 9% to $6.3 million. The increase was primarily attributable to costs incurred to support our new tower development and our site acquisition, zoning and permitting services. Other SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased 5% to $115.3 million. The increase was primarily due to a $13.7 million increase in corporate expenses, which were partially offset by an $8.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense. The increase in corporate expenses was primarily attributable to incremental employee and increased information technology costs associated with supporting a growing global organization. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense was primarily attributable to the one-time expense recognized upon the modification of certain equity awards in 2009, which did not recur in 2010.

International rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 26% to $217.0 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our international rental and management segment gross margin (30%) as described above, and was partially offset by increases in our international rental and management segment overhead costs (50%), as described above. Network development services segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased 10% to $15.7 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenue and an increase in segment overhead costs, as described above.

The ETR for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased to 32.8% from 43.3%. The decrease in the ETR was primarily due to reduced foreign withholding taxes, the recognition of previously reserved NOLs and a reduction in the foreign currency impact on certain tax items. The ETRs on income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 differ from the federal statutory rate due primarily to adjustments for foreign items, non-deductible stock-based compensation expense, tax reserves and state taxes. 42 Table of Contents Net Income/Adjusted EBITDA Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2010 2009 Net income $ 373,606 $ 247,127 $ 126,479 51 % Income from discontinued operations, net (30 ) (8,179 ) (8,149 ) (100 ) Income from continuing operations 373,576 238,948 134,628 56 Income on equity method investments (40 ) (26 ) 14 54 Income tax provision 182,489 182,565 (76 ) — Other income (315 ) (1,294 ) (979 ) (76 ) Loss on retirement of long-term obligations 1,886 18,194 (16,308 ) (90 ) Interest expense 246,018 249,803 (3,785 ) (2 ) Interest income (5,024 ) (1,722 ) 3,302 192 Other operating expenses 35,876 19,168 16,708 87 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 460,726 414,619 46,107 11 Stock-based compensation expense 52,555 60,670 (8,115 ) (13 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,347,747 $ 1,180,925 $ 166,822 14 % Net income for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 51% to $373.6 million.

Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased 14% to $1,347.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our rental and management segments gross margin and network development services segment gross margin and was partially offset by an increase in selling, general, administrative and development expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview As a holding company, our cash flows are derived primarily from the operations of and distributions from our operating subsidiaries or funds raised through borrowings under our credit facilities and debt and equity offerings. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $1,577.2 million of total liquidity, comprised of $330.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to borrow an aggregate of approximately $1,247.0 million under our $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) and our $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2011 Credit Facility”) net of any outstanding letters of credit. In January 2012, we refinanced the Revolving Credit Facility and our term loan, as described in more detail below under caption “—Cash Flows from Financing Activities.” Summary cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 is set forth below. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 1,165,942 $ 1,020,977 $ 842,126 Investing activities (2,790,812 ) (1,300,902 ) (543,066 ) Financing activities 1,086,095 910,330 (194,942 ) Net effect of changes in exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (14,997 ) 6,265 98 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (553,772 ) $ 636,670 $ 104,216 43 Table of Contents We use our cash flows to fund our operations and investments in our business, including tower maintenance and improvements, tower construction and DAS network installations, and tower and land acquisitions and also expect to make distributions of our REIT taxable income in order to maintain our REIT qualification under the Code. During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we also used our cash flows to fund acquisitions and fund our stock repurchase programs. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2011, we used our cash flows to pay the Pre-REIT Distribution. Our significant financing transactions in 2011 included the following: • We increased our borrowing capacity by entering into the 2011 Credit Facility, which allows us to borrow up to $1.0 billion. • We completed a registered offering of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.90% senior notes due 2021 (“5.90% Notes”). • We repurchased approximately 8.1 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $423.9 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to our stock repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2011, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $7.2 billion. We generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and cash interest obligations in 2011. We believe cash generated by our operations for the year ending December 31, 2012 also will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures, our cash debt service (interest and principal repayments) obligations and REIT distribution requirements for 2012. If our pending acquisitions, capital expenditures or debt repayments exceed the cash generated by operations, we have sufficient borrowing capacity under our credit facilities. As a REIT, we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income so as not to be subject to the income or excise tax on undistributed REIT taxable income. We intend to commence paying regular distributions in 2012. The amount, timing and frequency of distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will be based upon various factors. See Item 5 of this Annual Report under the caption “Dividends” for a discussion of those factors considered. For more information regarding our financing transactions in 2011, see “—Cash Flows from Financing Activities” below. Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash provided by operating activities was $1,165.9 million, an increase of $145.0 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase was primarily comprised of an increase in the operating profit of our rental and management segments and our network development services segment, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for interest and income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash provided by operating activities was $1,021.0 million, an increase of approximately $178.9 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase was primarily comprised of an increase of $180.5 million in the operating profit of our rental and management segments and our network development services segment, partially offset by an increase in the amount spent to meet working capital needs. Cash Flows from Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash used for investing activities was $2,790.8 million, an increase of approximately $1,489.9 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase was primarily comprised of increased spending for acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2011. 44 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2011, payments for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities totaled $523.0 million, including $296.9 million of capital expenditures for discretionary capital projects, such as completion of the construction of approximately 1,850 communications sites, $91.3 million spent to acquire land under our towers that was subject to ground agreements (including leases), $79.5 million of capital expenditures related to capital improvements and corporate capital expenditures primarily attributable to information technology improvements and $55.3 million for the redevelopment of existing sites to accommodate new tenant equipment. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2011, we spent $2,320.7 million to acquire approximately 8,620 communications sites in the United States, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ghana, Mexico and South Africa and approximately 2,150 property interests under communications sites in the United States. We plan to continue to allocate our available capital after our REIT distribution requirements among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria. Accordingly, we may continue to acquire communications sites, acquire land under our towers, build or install new communications sites and redevelop or improve existing communications sites when the expected returns on such investments meet our return on investment criteria. We expect that our 2012 total capital expenditures will be between approximately $500 million and $600 million, including between $85 million and $95 million for capital improvements and corporate capital expenditures, between $65 and $75 million for the redevelopment of existing communications sites, between $90 million and $100 million for ground lease purchases and between $260 million and $330 million for other discretionary capital projects including the construction of approximately 1,800 to 2,200 new communications sites. For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash used for investing activities was $1,300.9 million, an increase of approximately $757.8 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. This increase was primarily comprised of increased spending for acquisitions, property and equipment and construction activities during the year ended December 31, 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2010, payments for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities totaled $346.7 million, including $43.0 million of capital expenditures related to capital improvements and corporate capital expenditures primarily attributable to information technology improvements, $194.4 million spent in connection with the construction of over 1,000 towers, the installation of approximately 30 in-building DAS networks and the installation of shared back-up power generators, $83.5 million spent to acquire land under our towers that was subject to ground agreements (including leases) and $25.8 million for the redevelopment of existing sites to accommodate new tenant equipment. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2010, we spent $420.7 million, net of $106.6 million cash acquired, to acquire Essar Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited and $585.5 million to acquire approximately 2,100 additional towers. Cash Flows from Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash provided by financing activities was $1,086.1 million, as compared to cash provided by financing activities of approximately $910.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The $1,086.1 million of cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2011 partially relates to borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility of $925.0 million, proceeds from the issuance of our 5.90% Notes of $500.0 million ($495.2 million net of discount, commissions and expenses), proceeds from other long-term borrowings of $212.8 million, proceeds from short-term borrowings of $128.1 million, proceeds from stock options, warrants and stock purchase plans of $85.6 million and borrowings under our other credit facilities of $80.0 million, partially offset by payments for the repurchase of our common stock of $437.4 million, which consisted of $426.1 million of stock repurchases under our stock repurchase programs ($423.9 million, including commissions and fees, and a decrease in accrued treasury stock of $2.2 million) and $11.2 million of amounts surrendered for the satisfaction of employee tax obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units, repayment of notes payable, amounts outstanding under our credit facilities and capital leases of $395.4 million and distributions to stockholders of $137.8 million in connection with the Pre-REIT Distribution. 45 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash provided by financing activities was $910.3 million, as compared to cash used for financing activities of approximately $194.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily related to $1.0 billion ($991.9 million, net of discount, commissions and expenses) of proceeds from the issuance of the 4.50% senior notes due 2018, $700.0 million ($693.6 million, net of discount, commissions and expenses) of proceeds from the issuance of the 5.05% senior notes due 2020, the proceeds from stock options and SpectraSite, Inc. warrants of $138.5 million and borrowings under our credit facilities of $500.6 million, partially offset by payments for the repurchase of our common stock of $430.6 million, which consisted of $423.0 million ($420.8 million, including commissions and expenses, net of a decrease in accrued treasury stock of $2.2 million) of stock repurchases under our 2008 Buyback and $7.6 million of amounts surrendered for the satisfaction of employee tax obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units, and the repayment of notes payable, amounts outstanding under our credit facilities and capital leases of $983.7 million. Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $1.0 billion outstanding and the ability to borrow approximately $247.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. On January 31, 2012, we repaid and terminated the Revolving Credit Facility, without penalty or premium, with proceeds from the 2011 Credit Facility and a new unsecured revolving credit facility entered into on January 31, 2012 (the “2012 Credit Facility”). Term Loan. On March 24, 2008, we entered into the $325.0 million Term Loan pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2011, the Term Loan was fully drawn. On January 31, 2012, we repaid the Term Loan with proceeds from the 2011 Credit Facility and 2012 Credit Facility. 2011 Credit Facility. On April 8, 2011, we entered into the 2011 Credit Facility, with initial commitments of $860.0 million, and on June 16, 2011, we received additional commitments of $140.0 million. As a result, as of December 31, 2011, the 2011 Credit Facility allows us to borrow up to $1.0 billion. We will continue to maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the 2011 Credit Facility in the ordinary course. The 2011 Credit Facility has a term of five years and matures on April 8, 2016. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. We have the option of choosing either a defined base rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) as the applicable base rate for borrowings under the 2011 Credit Facility. The interest rate ranges between 1.350% to 2.600% above the LIBOR rate for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.350% to 1.600% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based upon our debt ratings. A quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the 2011 Credit Facility is required, ranging from 0.250% to 0.550% per annum, based upon our debt ratings. The current margin over LIBOR that we would incur on borrowings is 1.850% and the current commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the 2011 Credit Facility is 0.350%. The 2011 Credit Facility may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. The 2011 Credit Facility allows us to use borrowings for our and our subsidiaries’ working capital needs and other general corporate purposes (including, without limitation, to refinance or repurchase other indebtedness and, provided certain conditions are met, to repurchase our equity securities and make other distributions to stockholders, in each case without additional lender approval). As of December 31, 2011, we had not drawn on the 2011 Credit Facility. On January 31, 2012, we borrowed $625.0 million under the 2011 Credit Facility, which was used to partially repay the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan. 2012 Credit Facility. On January 31, 2012, we entered into the 2012 Credit Facility that allows us to borrow up to $1.0 billion. At closing, we borrowed $700.0 million under the 2012 Credit Facility to partially repay the amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan. We will maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the 2012 Credit Facility in the ordinary course. The 2012 Credit Facility has a term of five years and matures on January 31, 2017. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. We have the option of 46 Table of Contents choosing either a defined base rate or the LIBOR rate as the applicable base rate for borrowings under the 2012 Credit Facility. The interest rate ranges between 1.075% to 2.400% above the LIBOR rate for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.075% to 1.400% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based upon our debt ratings. A quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the 2012 Credit Facility is required, ranging from 0.125% to 0.450% per annum, based upon our debt ratings. The current margin over LIBOR that we would incur on borrowings is 1.625% and the current commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the 2012 Credit Facility is 0.225%. The 2012 Credit Facility may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. The 2012 Credit Facility allows us to use borrowings for our and our subsidiaries’ working capital needs and other general corporate purposes (including, without limitation, to refinance or repurchase other indebtedness and, provided certain conditions are met, to repurchase our equity securities and make other distributions to stockholders, in each case without additional lender approval). Senior Notes Offering. On October 6, 2011, we completed a registered public offering of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.90% Notes. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $495.2 million, after deducting commissions and expenses. We used the net proceeds to finance acquisitions and repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility. The 5.90% Notes mature on November 1, 2021, and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing on May 1, 2012. We may redeem the 5.90% Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date. Interest on the notes will accrue from October 6, 2011 and will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. If we undergo a change of control (as defined in the indenture governing the 5.90% Notes) and ratings decline (in the event that on or within 90 days after an announcement of a change of control, both of our current investment grade credit ratings cease to be investment grade), we will be required to offer to repurchase all of the 5.90% Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but not including the repurchase date. The 5.90% Notes rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries. The indenture contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and our (together with our subsidiaries’) ability to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that we and our subsidiaries may incur certain liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness, if the aggregate amount of such liens does not exceed 3.5x Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the indenture. Colombian Short-Term Credit Facility. In connection with the purchase of the exclusive use rights for towers from Telefónica S.A.’s Colombian subsidiary, Colombia Telecomunicaciones S.A. E.S.P. (“Coltel”), we entered into a 72.8 billion Colombian Peso-denominated short-term credit facility on September 3, 2010. On November 24, 2010, we increased the credit facility to 139.1 billion Colombian Pesos. On July 25, 2011, we refinanced this credit facility with a new 141.1 billion Colombian Peso-denominated short-term credit facility. As of December 31, 2011, the facility accrued interest at 7.15%. As of December 31, 2011, 141.1 billion Colombian Pesos (approximately $72.8 million) were outstanding under this credit facility. In January 2012, the maturity date of this facility was extended to April 25, 2012. Colombian Bridge Loan. In connection with the acquisition of communications sites from Colombia Movil S.A. E.S.P. (“Colombia Movil”), our subsidiary entered into a 51.9 billion Colombian Peso-denominated bridge loan (the “Colombian Bridge Loan”) in December 2011. As of December 31, 2011, the facility accrued interest at 7.15% and matures on March 22, 2012. As of December 31, 2011, 51.9 billion Colombian Pesos (approximately $26.8 million) were outstanding under this loan. South African Facility. In connection with the acquisition of communications sites from Cell C (Pty) Limited (“Cell C”), our local South African subsidiary borrowed 695.4 million South African Rand under a 47 Table of Contents bridge loan (the “Bridge Loan”) in March 2011. In November 2011, the Bridge Loan was refinanced with the proceeds from a South African Rand-denominated credit facility (the “South African Facility”) that allows our local South African subsidiary (“SA Borrower”) to borrow up to 1.2 billion South African Rand. The South African Facility generally matures on March 31, 2020, subject to earlier maturity resulting from repayment increases tied either to SA Borrower’s excess cash flows or permitted distributions to SA Borrower’s parent. Outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The South African Facility generally may not be prepaid in whole or in part during the first twenty-four months from financial close absent prepayment consideration, but may thereafter be prepaid absent such consideration. Under the terms of the South African Facility, interest is payable quarterly at a rate generally equal to 3.75% per annum, plus the three month Johannesburg Interbank Agreed Rate. A quarterly commitment fee of 0.75% per annum applies to additional availability under the South African Facility. As of December 31, 2011, the interest rate of the South African Facility was 9.345%. Borrowings may only be used to repay the Bridge Loan or fund the purchase price for additional communications sites from Cell C. The loan agreement contains certain reporting, information, financial ratios and operating covenants. Failure to comply with certain of the financial and operating covenants would constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. The loan agreement requires that SA Borrower manage exposure to variability in interest rates on at least fifty percent of the amounts outstanding under the South African Facility. Accordingly, SA Borrower entered into interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 350.0 million South African Rand with certain of the lenders under the South African Facility on January 16, 2012. As of December 31, 2011, 687.0 million South African Rand (approximately $84.9 million) was outstanding under the South African Facility. Ghana Loan. In connection with the establishment of our joint venture with MTN Group and the acquisitions of communications sites in Ghana, Ghana Tower Interco B.V., a 51% owned subsidiary of American Tower, entered into a U.S. Dollar-denominated shareholder loan agreement (“Ghana Loan”), as the borrower, with our wholly owned subsidiary (“ATC Subsidiary”) and Mobile Telephone Networks (Netherlands) B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of MTN Group (“MTN Subsidiary”), as the lenders. Pursuant to the terms of the Ghana Loan, loans were made to the joint venture in connection with the acquisition of communications sites from MTN Group’s operating subsidiary in Ghana. The Ghana Loan accrues interest at 9.0% and matures on May 4, 2016. The portion of the loans made by the ATC Subsidiary is eliminated in consolidation, and the portion of the loans made by the MTN Subsidiary is reported as outstanding debt of American Tower. As of December 31, 2011, an aggregate of $127.5 million was payable to the MTN Subsidiary. Unison Notes. In connection with the Unison Acquisition on October 14, 2011, we assumed $196.0 million of existing indebtedness under three separate classes of Secured Cellular Site Revenue Notes (the “Unison Notes”) issued by Unison Ground Lease Funding, LLC (the “Unison Issuer”) in a securitization transaction (the “Unison Securitization”). The three classes of Unison Notes bear interest at rates of 5.349%, 6.392% and 9.522% respectively, with anticipated repayment dates of April 15, 2017, April 15, 2020 and April 15, 2020, respectively, and a final maturity date of April 15, 2040. The Unison Issuer may prepay the Unison Notes in whole or in part at any time following May 6, 2012, provided such payment is accompanied by applicable prepayment consideration. If the prepayment occurs within six months of the anticipated repayment date, no prepayment consideration is due. The Unison Notes are secured by, among other things, liens on approximately 1,470 real property interests owned by two special purpose subsidiaries of the Unison Issuer and other related assets. 48 Table of Contents Under the terms of the indenture for the Unison Notes (the “Unison Indenture”), the Unison Notes will be paid from the cash flows generated by the property interests subject to the Unison Securitization. The Unison Issuer is required to make monthly payments of interest to holders of the Unison Notes. On a monthly basis, cash flows in excess of amounts needed to make debt service payments and other payments required under the Unison Indenture are to be distributed to the Unison Issuer, which may then be distributed to, and used by, us. Excess cash flows distributed to the Unison Issuer and potentially to us are not expected to be material. As of December 31, 2011, we had $196.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Unison Notes, which at the time of acquisition had a $13.3 million premium recorded as a result of fair value adjustments recognized upon the Unison Acquisition. Stock Repurchase Programs. In February 2008, our Board of Directors approved the 2008 Buyback, pursuant to which we were authorized to purchase $1.5 billion of common stock. In July 2011, we ceased making repurchases under the 2008 Buyback and we do not expect to make any additional repurchases under the 2008 Buyback in the future. In March 2011, our Board of Directors approved the 2011 Buyback, pursuant to which we are authorized to purchase up to an additional $1.5 billion of common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we repurchased 8.1 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $423.9 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the stock repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2011, we had repurchased 34.5 million shares of common stock for an aggregate of $1,411.6 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the 2008 Buyback, and 3.4 million shares of common stock for an aggregate of $181.2 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the 2011 Buyback. Between January 1, 2012 and February 6, 2012, we repurchased an additional 37,900 shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $2.3 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the 2011 Buyback. As a result, as of February 6, 2012, we had repurchased a total of approximately 3.5 million shares of our common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $183.5 million, including commissions and fees. Under each program, we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. To facilitate repurchases, we make purchases pursuant to trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, which allow us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. We expect to continue to manage the pacing of the remaining $1.3 billion under the 2011 Buyback in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors. In the near term, we expect to fund any further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Purchases under each program are subject to us having available cash to fund repurchases. Sales of Equity Securities. We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plans. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we received an aggregate of $85.6 million in proceeds from sales of shares pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan and upon exercises of stock options. Dividends. We declared and paid the Pre-REIT Distribution of approximately $137.8 million to our stockholders in December 2011. No dividends were declared in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. 49 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations. Our contractual obligations relate primarily to the Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-1 issued in our securitization transaction, borrowings under our credit facilities, our outstanding notes and our operating leases related to the ground under our towers. The following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations payable in cash as of December 31, 2011 (in thousands): Contractual Obligations 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-1 $ — $ — $ 1,750,000 $ — $ — $ — $ 1,750,000 Revolving Credit Facility(1) — — — — 300,000 700,000 1,000,000 Term Loan(1) — — — — 325,000 — 325,000 Unison Notes, Series 2010-1 Class C, Series 2010-2 Class C and Series 2010-2 Class F notes(2) — — — — — 196,000 196,000 Colombian Bridge Loan(3) 26,780 — — — — — 26,780 Colombian Short-Term Credit Facility(4) 72,811 — — — — — 72,811 South African Facility(5) — — — — — 84,920 84,920 Ghana Loan(6) — — — — 127,466 — 127,466 4.50% senior notes — — — — — 1,000,000 1,000,000 5.05% senior notes — — — — — 700,000 700,000 4.625% senior notes — — — 600,000 — — 600,000 5.90% senior notes — — — — — 500,000 500,000 7.00% senior notes — — — — — 500,000 500,000 7.25% senior notes — — — — — 300,000 300,000 Long-term obligations, excluding capital leases and other notes payable 99,591 — 1,750,000 600,000 752,466 3,980,920 7,182,977 Cash interest expense 332,000 323,000 249,000 204,000 191,000 458,000 1,757,000 Capital lease payments (including interest) and other notes payable 5,429 5,120 4,418 3,294 3,417 167,457 189,135 Total debt serviceobligations 437,020 328,120 2,003,418 807,294 946,883 4,606,377 9,129,112 Operating lease payments(7) 303,281 293,023 288,867 282,793 270,452 2,609,470 4,047,886 Other long-termliabilities(8)(9) 495 18,990 8,816 1,816 1,104 1,158,049 1,189,270 Total $ 740,796 $ 640,133 $ 2,301,101 $ 1,091,903 $ 1,218,439 $ 8,373,896 $ 14,366,268 (1) On January 31, 2011, we repaid and terminated the Revolving Credit Facility and repaid the Term Loan with $625.0 million of proceeds from the 2011 Credit Facility, which matures on April 8, 2016, and $700.0 million of proceeds from the 2012 Credit Facility, which matures on January 31, 2017. We had the option of choosing either a defined base rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) as the applicable base interest rate for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan. For the Revolving Credit Facility, the interest rate ranged between 0.40% and 1.25% above the applicable LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.00% and 0.25% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case 50 Table of Contents based on our debt ratings. For the Term Loan, the interest rate ranged between 0.50% and 1.50% above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.00% and 0.50% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based on our debt ratings. A quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the Revolving Credit Facility was required, ranging from 0.08% to 0.25% per annum, based on our debt ratings. (2) Unison Notes, Series 2010-1 Class C, Series 2010-2 Class C and Series 2010-2 Class F notes were assumed by us as a result of the Unison Acquisition. (3) The Colombian Bridge Loan is denominated in Colombian Pesos and was entered into in connection with the purchase of towers from Colombia Movil. (4) The Colombian Short-Term Credit Facility is denominated in Colombian Pesos and was entered into in connection with the purchase of the exclusive use rights for towers from Coltel. (5) The South African Facility is denominated in South African Rand. (6) The Ghana Loan is denominated in U.S. Dollars and was entered into in connection with the establishment of our joint venture and subsequent acquisitions of towers in Ghana. (7) Operating lease payments include payments to be made under non-cancellable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that we will renew the lease. (8) Primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other long-term liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily our straight-line rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash. (9) Other long-term liabilities exclude $36.6 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and $31.5 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled. Settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe. However, based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements, we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Interest Rate Swap Agreements. As of December 31, 2011, we have no outstanding interest rate swap agreements as all interest swaps matured during the year. As of December 31, 2010, we held 12 interest rate swap agreements, all of which had been designated as cash flow hedges, and which had an aggregate notional amount of $525.0 million, interest rates ranging from 2.86% to 3.74% and expiration dates through March 2011. On January 16, 2012, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the variability in the forecasted interest payments on 50% of the amount outstanding under the South African Facility. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Internally Generated Funds. Because the majority of our tenant leases are multi-year contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management operations as of the end of 2011 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites. 51 Table of Contents Restrictions Under Loan Agreements Relating to Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan and 2011 Credit Facility. The loan agreements for the Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan, and 2011 Credit Facility contain certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and all of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreements also contain covenants that establish three financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage, senior secured leverage and interest coverage, as set forth below. Where we designate certain of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries in accordance with the respective agreements, those subsidiaries are excluded for purposes of the covenant calculations. As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. • Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (each as defined in the loan agreements) of 6.00 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, under the Revolving Credit Facility, we could have incurred approximately $1.98 billion of additional indebtedness and under the 2011 Credit Facility, we could have incurred approximately $2.22 billion of additional indebtedness and still remain in compliance with this ratio. In addition, if we maintain our existing debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels, under the Revolving Credit Facility, our revenues could have decreased by approximately $330 million and under the 2011 Credit Facility, our revenues could have decreased by approximately $370 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. • Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of Senior Secured Debt (as defined in the loan agreements) to Adjusted EBITDA of 3.00 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, under the Revolving Credit Facility, we could have incurred approximately $2.57 billion of additional Senior Secured Debt and under the 2011 Credit Facility, we could have incurred approximately $2.73 billion of additional Senior Secured Debt and still remain in compliance with this ratio. In addition, if we maintain our existing Senior Secured Debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels under the Revolving Credit Facility, our revenues could have decreased by approximately $857 million and under the 2011 Credit Facility, our revenues could have decreased by approximately $911 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. • Interest Coverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we maintain a ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense (as defined in the loan agreements) of not less than 2.50 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, our interest expense, which was $294 million for that period under the Revolving Credit Facility, could have increased by approximately $314 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. Our interest expense, which was $299 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011 under the 2011 Credit Facility could have increased by approximately $330 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. In addition, if our interest expense does not change materially from current levels, under the Revolving Credit Facility, our revenues could have decreased by approximately $785 million and under the 2011 Credit Facility, our revenues could have decreased by approximately $825 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. On January 31, 2012, we entered into the 2012 Credit Facility. The loan agreement for the 2012 Credit Facility contains financial ratios and operating covenants that are substantially similar to those in the 2011 Credit Facility, including the three financial tests described above. Also, on January 31, 2012, we repaid the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan with $625.0 million of proceeds from the 2011 Credit Facility and $700.0 million of proceeds from the 2012 Credit Facility. Upon repayment, we terminated the Revolving Credit Facility. The loan agreements for the 2011 Credit Facility and 2012 Credit Facility also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants. Any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreements for the 2011 Credit Facility and 2012 Credit Facility would not only prevent us from being able to borrow 52 Table of Contents additional funds under the facilities, but would constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreement for the 2011 Credit Facility and 2012 Credit Facility and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next twelve months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. Restrictions Under Loan Agreement Relating to our Securitization Transaction. The loan agreement related to the securitization transaction (the “Securitization”) involved assets related to 5,295 broadcast and wireless communications towers owned by two special purpose subsidiaries of the Company (the “Borrowers”), through a private offering of $1.75 billion of Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-1 (the “Certificates”). As of December 31, 2011, 5,285 broadcast and communications towers are owned by the two special purpose subsidiaries. The Securitization loan agreement includes certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the Borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. The Borrowers’ organizational documents contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities, including the requirement that the Borrowers maintain at least two independent directors. The Securitization loan agreement also contains certain covenants that require the Borrowers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets, promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the Securitization loan agreement and other agreements related to the towers subject to the Securitization, and allow the trustee reasonable access to the towers, including the right to conduct site investigations. Under the terms of the Securitization loan agreement, the loan will be paid solely from the cash flows generated by the towers subject to the Securitization, which must be deposited, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the Securitization loan. The Borrowers are required to make monthly payments of interest on the Securitization loan. On a monthly basis, all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the Securitization loan, referred to as excess cash flow, is to be released to the Borrowers for distribution to us. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Borrowers distributed excess cash to us of approximately $497.1 million. In order to distribute this excess cash flow to us, the Borrowers must maintain several specified ratios with respect to their debt service coverage (“DSCR”). For this purpose, DSCR is tested as of the last day of each calendar quarter and is generally defined as four times the Borrowers’ net cash flow for that quarter divided by the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees that the Borrowers must pay over the succeeding twelve months on the Securitization loan. Pursuant to one such test, if the DSCR as of the end of any calendar quarter were: • 1.30x or less, during the five-year period commencing on the closing date of the Securitization in May 2007, or • 1.75x or less, thereafter, (1.30x or 1.75x as applicable, the “Cash Trap DSCR”), then all excess cash flow would be placed in a reserve account and would not be released to the Borrowers for distribution to us until the DSCR exceeded the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. Additionally, while we do not anticipate commencing principal payments with respect to any component of the Securitization loan until April 2014, excess cash flow would be applied to principal during an “Amortization Period” under the Securitization loan until April 2014. An “Amortization Period” would commence under the Securitization loan if the DSCR as of the end of any calendar quarter fell below: • 1.15x, during the five-year period commencing on the closing date of the Securitization in May 2007, or • 1.45x thereafter (1.15x or 1.45x as applicable, the “Minimum DSCR”). 53 Table of Contents In such a case, all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve account because the Cash Trap DSCR was not met would be applied to pay principal of the Securitization loan on each monthly payment date until the DSCR exceeded the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Consequently, a failure to comply with the covenants in the Securitization loan agreement could prevent the Borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers. Additionally, a failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent the Borrowers from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our discretionary expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions, pay REIT distribution requirements and fund our stock repurchase program. In addition, if the Borrowers were to default on the loan related to the Securitization, the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the Securitization, in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers. As of December 31, 2011, the Borrowers’ DSCR was 3.60x. Based on the Borrowers’ net cash flow for the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2011 and the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the Securitization loan, the Borrowers could endure a reduction of approximately $227.3 million in net cash flow before triggering a Cash Trap DSCR, and approximately $242.1 million in net cash flow before triggering an Amortization Period. As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness. In addition, to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and fund our stock repurchase program, we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities. If we determined that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth expansion initiatives, refinance our existing indebtedness, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements or fund our stock repurchase program. In addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under the caption “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and, consequently, a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to impairment of assets (including goodwill), asset retirement obligations, acquisitions, revenue recognition, rent expense, stock-based compensation and income taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2011. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles 54 Table of Contents in the United States, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. • Impairment of Assets—Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization: We review long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable. We review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indications of impairment on an individual tower basis, which primarily result from a tower not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy. To the extent that cash flows generated under this approach are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the towers, the towers and network location intangible assets are impaired. We monitor our customer-related intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indications of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts, or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the customer-related intangible assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows. If we determine that the carrying value of the customer-related intangible asset may not be recoverable, we measure any impairment based on the fair value of the asset as determined by the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset, as compared to the asset’s carrying value. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment. • Impairment of Assets—Goodwill—Assets Not Subject to Amortization: We review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is recorded in our domestic and international rental and management segments and network development services segment. We utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment. When conducting this test, we employ a discounted cash flow analysis, corroborated by a peer group and market valuation analysis. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. Under the first step of this test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying value of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we conduct the second step of this test, in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized. During the year ended December 31, 2011, no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test, as the fair value of each of our reporting units, was in excess of its carrying value and passed with a substantial margin; except for two reporting units, whose fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately $10.6 million. For these two reporting units, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that none of the following negative changes in our assumptions individually, which we determined to be reasonable, would impact our conclusions: • A 1% reduction in projected net income, or a 15 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital, or a 4% reduction in terminal sales growth rate. The goodwill recorded in these two reporting units approximated $88.9 million as of December 31, 2011, and is the result of recently completed acquisitions. Accordingly, the sensitivity of projections to changes in the various assumptions is due, in part, to the timing of the underlying acquisition(s), current levels of cash flows and amounts of cash flows generated in excess of the 55 Table of Contents planned amounts. Due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the measurement date, the fair value of intangible assets and goodwill used to test for impairment is in line with the fair value used to initially measure the business. • Asset Retirement Obligations: We recognize asset retirement obligations associated with our legal obligation to retire tangible long-lived assets and the related asset retirement costs, which are principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of our tower assets are located, in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made, and we accrete such liability through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. The associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets and depreciated over their estimated useful life. We updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net decrease in the estimated obligation of $70.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 and an increase of $3.3 million, during the year ended December 31, 2010. The change in 2011 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows, and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense. The significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary. • Acquisitions: For those acquisitions that meet the criteria of a business combination, we allocate the purchase price, including any contingent consideration, to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition with any excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. For those acquisitions that do not meet the criteria of a business combination, we allocate the purchase price to property and equipment for the fair value of the towers and to identifiable intangible assets (primarily acquired customer-related and network location intangibles). The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future customer cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition. The determination of the final purchase price and allocation may extend over more than one period and result in adjustments to the preliminary estimate recognized. • Revenue Recognition: Rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned and when collectability is reasonably assured, regardless of whether the payments from the tenants are received in equal monthly amounts. Fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease agreements, excluding those tied to the Consumer Price Index or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants are recognized on a straight-line basis over the fixed, non-cancellable terms of the applicable leases. Total rental and management straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 approximated $144.0 million, $105.2 million and $36.3 million, respectively. Amounts billed up-front 56 Table of Contents for certain services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases. Amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until the earnings process is complete. We derive the largest portion of our revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, and approximately 53% of our revenues are derived from four tenants in the industry. In addition, we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. We mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of our borrowers and tenants. In recognizing customer revenue we must assess the collectability of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectability of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved. Any amounts which were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense. Accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and reserves for amounts invoiced whose collectability is not reasonably assured. • Rent Expense: Many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time. We calculate straight-line ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears, at the inception of the lease, to be reasonably assured. Certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease, if the tenant exercises its renewal option. For towers with these types of tenant leases at the inception of the ground lease, we calculate our straight-line ground rent over the term of the ground lease, including all renewal options required to fulfill the tenant lease obligation. In addition to the straight-line ground rent expense recorded, we also record an associated straight-line rent liability in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Leases may contain complex terms that often are subject to interpretation. • Stock-Based Compensation: We measure stock-based compensation cost at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and the fair value is recognized as an expense over the service period, which generally represents the vesting period. The expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will not fully vest and be forfeited. The fair value of a stock option is determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that takes into account a number of assumptions at the accounting measurement date including the stock price, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock, the expected distributions, and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. These assumptions are highly subjective and could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the compensation expense. The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. We recognize stock-based compensation in either selling, general, administrative and development expense, costs of operations or as part of the costs associated with the construction of our tower assets. • Income Taxes: We intend to elect to be taxed as a REIT under the Code effective January 1, 2012, and will generally not be subject to federal and state income taxes on our qualified REIT subsidiaries’ taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders provided we meet certain organization and operating requirements. However, even as a REIT, we will remain obligated to pay income taxes on earnings from all or a portion of our TRS assets. In addition, our international assets and operations continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted. 57 Table of Contents Accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes. To the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for book purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax purposes, deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns, which may differ from the current rate. At December 31, 2011, we have reversed deferred tax assets and liabilities related to our REIT activities. Because we began operating as a REIT effective January 1, 2012, we will generally not pay federal income tax at the REIT level (including our qualified REIT subsidiaries), but instead a dividends paid deduction will offset our taxable income. As a result, while we will still be permitted to use NOLs and tax credit carryforwards to offset our REIT taxable income, we do not expect to pay taxes on our REIT taxable income, and therefore do not expect to be able to realize such deferred tax assets and liabilities. We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2011, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $5.8 million which primarily relates to foreign NOLs. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets, primarily our foreign and federal NOLs related to our TRS entities, as we believe that we will have sufficient taxable income to realize these federal NOLs during the applicable carryforward period. Valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability. The recoverability of our net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing projections based on our current operations. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. The realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately $70 million in federal (for TRS entities) and state taxable income, respectively, from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2031. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future, we will be required to reassess our deferred tax assets and consider a valuation allowance. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination, which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe, or if the applicable statute of limitations lapses. We believe that the amount of the change could range from zero to $3 million. As of December 31, 2011, we have classified approximately $36.6 million as other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. We also classified approximately $31.5 million of accrued income tax-related interest and penalties as other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2011. 58 Table of Contents The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws, regulations and administrative practices in a multitude of jurisdictions across our operations. From time to time, we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations, and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. We believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December 31, 2011. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new guidance which establishes accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenue-generating activities. This guidance requires companies to allocate the overall consideration to each deliverable under the arrangement using the estimated selling prices in the absence of vendor specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of selling price for deliverables. This guidance was effective for any contracts entered into, or materially modified by us on or after January 1, 2011 and did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In June 2011, the FASB issued amendments to the requirements for presentation of comprehensive income. This guidance, effective retrospectively for the interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011 (early adoption is permitted), requires presentation of total comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In December 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to this guidance which indefinitely defers the requirement to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We early adopted the amended guidance requiring presentation of comprehensive income in two consecutive financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011. The implementation of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Accounting Standards Updates In May 2011, the FASB amended its guidance related to fair value measurement and disclosure. This guidance clarifies existing measurement and disclosure requirements and results in greater consistency between GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. This guidance will be effective prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011. The implementation of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In September 2011, the FASB issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment that will become effective for the interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011 (with early adoption permitted). Under the new guidance, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the entity determines that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit is less than its fair value, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The implementation of this guidance will have no impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

Interest on the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan was payable in accordance with the applicable LIBOR agreement or quarterly and accrued at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted-average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2011 for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan was 0.95%. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the weighted average interest rate under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan was 1.71%. (b) As of December 31, 2010, variable rate debt consisted of our Revolving Credit Facility ($300.0 million drawn) and Term Loan ($325.0 million) included above based on the June 8, 2012 maturity date. As of December 31, 2010, fixed rate debt consisted of: the Certificates issued in the Securitization ($1.75 billion): the 7.25% senior notes due 2019 ($300.0 million principal amount due at maturity, the balance as of December 31, 2010 was $295.4 million); the 7.00% senior notes due 2017 ($500.0 million); the 4.625% senior notes due 2015 ($600.0 million principal amount due at maturity, the balance as of December 31, 2010 was $599.3 million); the 5.05% Notes 60 Table of Contents ($700.0 million principal amount due at maturity, the balance as of December 31, 2010 was $699.2 million); the 4.50% Notes ($1.0 billion principal amount due at maturity, the balance as of December 31, 2010 was $999.2 million); and other debt of $119.2 million (including the Colombian Short-Term Credit Facility). Interest on the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan is payable in accordance with the applicable LIBOR agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2010 for the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan was 3.10%. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the weighted average interest rate under the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan was 3.12%. (c) Includes notional amounts of $525.0 million that expired between January and March 2011. (d) Represents the weighted-average fixed rate or range of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts in a given year. As of December 31, 2011, we had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding. Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our total variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2011 was comprised of $1.0 billion under the Revolving Credit Facility and $325.0 million under the Term Loan. A 10% increase in current interest rates would have caused an additional pre-tax charge to our net income and an immaterial increase in our cash outflows for the year ended December 31, 2011. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2010, after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements, was comprised of $50.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility and $50.0 million under the Term Loan. A 10% increase in then-current interest rates would have caused an additional pre-tax charge to our net income and an immaterial increase to our cash outflows for the year ended December 31, 2010. We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar is reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in stockholders’ equity and as a component of comprehensive income. We may enter into foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions in order to minimize the risk of currency fluctuations. For the year ended December 31, 2011, approximately 26% of our revenues and approximately 34% of our operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies, as compared to 19% and 24% respectively, during the same period in 2010. We have performed sensitivity analyses assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2011 and 2010. As of December 31, 2011, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate by less than 4%. As of December 31, 2010, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our revenue, operating results or cash flows. As of December 31, 2011, we had a substantial amount of additional intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As this debt had not been designated as being of long-term investment in nature, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates would result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. An adverse change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances entered into in 2011 would have resulted in approximately $113.5 million of unrealized gains or losses that would be included in other (expense) income in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011.",2023-12-30 19:23:11.293624
1053507,AMT,AMERICAN TOWER CORP /MA/,2013,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements herein and the accompanying notes thereto, and the information set forth under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” below. Our continuing operations are reported in three segments, domestic rental and management, international rental and management and network and development services. Among other factors, management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit in its assessment of operating performance in each business segment. We define segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation recorded in costs of operations; depreciation, amortization and accretion; selling, general, administrative and development expense; and other operating expense. We define segment operating profit as segment gross margin less selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. Segment gross margin and segment operating profit for the international rental and management segment also include interest income, TV Azteca, net (see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included herein). These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before interest income, interest expense, loss on retirement of long-term obligations, other income (expense), net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest, income (loss) on equity method investments, income taxes and discontinued operations. Executive Overview Our primary business is leasing antenna space on multi-tenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. We refer to this business as our rental and management operations, which accounted for approximately 97% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 and includes our domestic rental and management segment and our international rental and management segment. Through our network development services segment, we offer tower-related services domestically, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services, which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. We began operating as a REIT for federal income tax purposes effective January 1, 2012. 29 Table of Contents The following table details the number of communications sites we own or operate in the countries in which we operate as of December 31, 2012: Country Number ofOwned Sites Number ofOperated Sites(1) United States 16,378 6,421 International: Brazil 4,193 155 Chile 1,181 — Colombia 2,298 706 Germany 2,031 — Ghana 1,931 — India 10,383 — Mexico 5,581 199 Peru 500 — South Africa 1,604 — Uganda 1,043 — (1) All of the sites we operate are held pursuant to long-term capital leases, including those subject to purchase options. The majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are typically for an initial non-cancellable term of five to ten years, with multiple five-year renewal terms thereafter. Accordingly, nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended December 31, 2012 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2012, we expect to generate approximately $20 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, excluding the impact of straight-line lease accounting. In addition, most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually based on a fixed percentage (on average approximately 3.5% in the United States), inflation, or inflation with a fixed minimum or maximum escalation for the year. Revenue generated by rent increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straight line basis over the non-cancellable term of the applicable agreement. We also routinely seek to extend our leases with our tenants, which increases the non-cancellable term of the lease and creates incremental growth in our revenues. The revenues generated by our rental and management operations may also be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multi-year contracts, which typically are non-cancellable; however in some instances, a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee. Revenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their terms or rent negotiations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management operations. During the year ended December 31, 2012, loss of annual revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented less than 1.3% of our rental and management operations revenues. Rental and Management Operations Revenue Growth. The primary factors affecting the revenue growth for our domestic and international rental and management segments are: • Recurring revenues from tenant leases generated from sites which existed in our portfolio as of the beginning of the prior year period (“legacy sites”); • Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of cancellations; • New revenue generated from leasing additional space on our legacy sites; and • New revenue generated from new sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior year period (“new sites”). 30 Table of Contents We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to meet that demand by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our legacy sites, which increases the utilization and profitability of our sites. In addition, we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers. Our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their networks as well as roll out next generation wireless technologies. In addition, we intend to continue to supplement the organic growth on our legacy sites by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk adjusted return on investment criteria. Rental and Management Operations Organic Revenue Growth. Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our legacy sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through collocation. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure needs, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital, and general economic conditions. The following key trends within each market that we serve provide opportunities for organic revenue growth: • Domestic. As a result of the rapid subscriber adoption of wireless data applications, wireless service providers in the United States continue to invest in their wireless networks by adding new cell sites as well as additional equipment to their existing cell sites. This level of wireless communications services growth has driven wireless providers in the United States to deploy consistent levels of annual wireless capital investment and as a result, we have experienced strong demand for our communications sites. We expect the following key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us: • The deployment of advanced wireless technology across existing wireless networks will provide higher speed data services and enable fixed broadband substitution. As a result, our tenants continue to deploy additional equipment across their existing networks. • Wireless service providers compete based on the overall capacity and coverage of their existing wireless networks. To maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases, our tenants continue to deploy additional equipment across their existing sites as well as add new cell sites. • Wireless service providers are also investing in reinforcing their networks through incremental backhaul and the utilization of on-site generators, which results in additional equipment leased at the tower site. • Wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum, and as a result are expected to add additional equipment to their network as they seek to optimize their network configuration. We signed holistic master lease agreements with three of our four major tenants in the United States, which provide for consistent, long-term revenue growth and a reduction in the potential impact of churn. Typically, these agreements include built-in annual escalators, fixed annual charges which permit our tenants to place a pre-determined amount of equipment on our sites and provisions for incremental lease payments if the equipment levels are exceeded. Our holistic master lease agreements build and foster strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced collocation cycle times, thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly deploy technology on our sites. • International. Most of our international markets are less advanced with respect to the current technologies deployed for wireless services. As a result, demand for our communications sites is predominantly driven by continued voice network investments, new market entrants and initial third generation (“3G”) data network deployments. For example, in India, nationwide voice networks 31 Table of Contents continue to be deployed as wireless service providers are beginning their investments in 3G data networks. Similarly, in Ghana and Uganda, wireless service providers continue to build out their voice and data networks in order to satisfy increasing demand for wireless services. In South Africa, where voice networks are in a more advanced stage of development, carriers are beginning to deploy 3G data networks across spectrum acquired in recent spectrum auctions. In Mexico and Brazil, where nationwide voice networks have also been deployed, some incumbent wireless service providers continue to invest in their 3G data networks, and recent spectrum auctions have enabled other incumbent wireless service providers to begin their initial investments in 3G data networks. In markets such as Chile, Peru and Colombia, recent or anticipated spectrum auctions are expected to drive investment in nationwide voice and 3G data networks. In Germany, our most mature international wireless market, demand is currently being driven by a government-mandated rural fourth generation network build-out, as well as other tenant initiatives to deploy next generation wireless services. We believe incremental demand for our tower sites will continue in our international markets as wireless service providers seek to remain competitive by increasing the coverage of their networks while also investing in next generation data networks. Rental and Management Operations New Site Revenue Growth. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through acquisitions and construction activities, including the acquisition and construction of approximately 8,810 sites. In a majority of our international markets, the acquisition or construction of new sites results in increased pass-through revenues and expenses. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire larger communications real estate portfolios, both domestically and internationally, to determine whether they meet our risk adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio. New Sites (Acquired or Constructed) 2012 2011 2010 Domestic 960 470 950 International(1) 7,850 10,000 6,870 (1) The majority of sites acquired or constructed in 2012 were in Brazil, Germany, India and Uganda; in 2011 were in Brazil, Colombia, Ghana, India, Mexico and South Africa; and in 2010 were in Chile, Colombia, India and Peru. Network Development Services Segment Revenue Growth. As we continue to focus on growing our rental and management operations, we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a relatively small percentage of our total revenues. Through our network development services segment, we offer tower-related services, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services, which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites, including in connection with provider network upgrades. Rental and Management Operations Expenses. Direct operating expenses incurred by our domestic and international rental and management segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent, property taxes, repairs and maintenance, security and power and fuel costs, some of which may be passed through to our tenants. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our domestic and international rental and management segments selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow. We may incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on expanding our portfolio. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities. 32 Table of Contents REIT Conversion. We began operating as a REIT effective January 1, 2012. The REIT tax rules require that we derive most of our income, other than income generated by a TRS, from investments in real estate, which for us primarily consists of income from the leasing of our communications sites. Under the Code, maintaining REIT status generally requires that no more than 25% of the value of the REIT’s assets be represented by securities of one or more TRSs and other non-qualifying assets. A REIT must annually distribute to its stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). During the year ended December 31, 2012, we paid an aggregate of approximately $355.6 million in regular cash distributions to our stockholders. We intend to continue paying regular distributions in 2013. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will be declared based upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain REIT status and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset, in whole or in part, our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. For more information on the requirements to qualify as a REIT, see Item 1 of this Annual Report under the caption “Business—Overview,” and Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors—If we fail to qualify as a REIT or fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we would be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates, which would substantially reduce funds otherwise available” and “—Certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes, which reduce our cash flows, and may have deferred and contingent tax liabilities.” Non-GAAP Financial Measures Included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (“Adjusted EBITDA”). We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before: income (loss) on discontinued operations, net; income (loss) from equity method investments; income tax provision (benefit); other income (expense); loss on retirement of long-term obligations; interest expense; interest income; other operating expenses; depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA is presented as we believe it is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) it is a key measure used by our management team for purposes of decision making and for evaluating the performance of our operating segments; (2) it is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain debt covenants; (3) it is widely used in the tower industry to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4) it provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period to period operating performance by eliminating items which are not operational in nature; and (5) it provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of different companies by excluding the impact of long-term strategic decisions which can differ significantly from company to company, such as decisions with respect to capital structure, capital investments and the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate. Our measurement of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, has been included below. 33 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands, except percentages) Revenue Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2012 2011 Rental and management Domestic $ 1,940,689 $ 1,744,260 $ 196,429 11 % International 862,801 641,925 220,876 34 Total rental and management 2,803,490 2,386,185 417,305 17 Network development services 72,470 57,347 15,123 26 Total revenues $ 2,875,960 $ 2,443,532 $ 432,428 18 % Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 18% to $2,876.0 million. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in both of our rental and management segments, including organic revenue growth attributable to our legacy sites and revenue growth attributable to the approximately 19,280 new sites that we have constructed or acquired since January 1, 2011. Domestic rental and management segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 11% to $1,940.7 million. This growth was comprised of: • Revenue growth from legacy sites of approximately 8%, which includes approximately 2% attributable to contractual rent escalations, net of tenant lease cancellations, and approximately 6% due to incremental revenue primarily generated from new tenant leases and amendments to existing tenant leases on our legacy sites, which includes the positive impact of approximately 1% due to customer settlements during the first quarter of 2012; • Revenue growth from new sites of approximately 2%, resulting from the construction or acquisition of approximately 1,430 new sites, as well as land interests under third-party sites since January 1, 2011; and • An increase of over 1% from the impact of straight-line lease accounting. International rental and management segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 34% to $862.8 million. This growth was comprised of: • Revenue growth from new sites of approximately 38%, resulting from the construction or acquisition of approximately 17,850 new sites since January 1, 2011; • Revenue growth from legacy sites of approximately 10%, which includes approximately 7% due to incremental revenue primarily generated from new tenant leases and amendments to existing tenant leases on our legacy sites, approximately 2% attributable to contractual rent escalations, net of tenant lease cancellations, and approximately 1% for the reversal of revenue reserves; and • A decline of over 14% attributable to the negative impact from foreign currency translation. Network development services segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 26% to $72.5 million. The growth was comprised of: • Revenue growth of 32% primarily attributable to an increase in structural engineering services as a result of an increase in customer lease applications which are primarily associated with our tenants’ next generation technology network upgrades during the year ended December 31, 2012; and • A decline of 6% resulting from a favorable one-time item recognized in connection with the reversal of amounts previously reserved during the year ended December 31, 2011. 34 Table of Contents Gross Margin Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2012 2011 Rental and management Domestic $ 1,583,134 $ 1,390,802 $ 192,332 14 % International 548,726 420,430 128,296 31 Total rental and management 2,131,860 1,811,232 320,628 18 Network development services 37,640 27,887 9,753 35 Domestic rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 14% to $1,583.1 million, which was comprised of: • Gross margin growth from legacy sites of approximately 11%, primarily associated with the increase in revenue, as described above, which was partially offset by an increase in direct operating costs primarily from increased straight-line rent expense and an increase in repairs and maintenance activity; and • Gross margin growth from new sites of approximately 3%, resulting from the construction or acquisition of approximately 1,430 new sites, as well as land interests under third-party sites since January 1, 2011. International rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 31% to $548.7 million, which was comprised of: • Gross margin growth from new sites of approximately 37%, resulting from the construction or acquisition of approximately 17,850 new sites since January 1, 2011; • Gross margin growth from legacy sites of approximately 8%, primarily associated with the increase in revenue, as described above; and • A decline of approximately 14% attributable to the negative impact from foreign currency translation. Network development services segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 35% to $37.6 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue described above.

The increase was attributable to an increase in both of our rental and management segments, as well as an increase in our Other SG&A. 35 Table of Contents Domestic rental and management segment SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 11% to $85.7 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the impact of initiatives that we launched during 2011, designed to drive growth and to support a growing portfolio, including increased staffing in field operations, sales and finance and other functions supporting the expansion of our business. International rental and management segment SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 16% to $95.6 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the launch of operations in our new markets as well as our continued investments in international expansion initiatives in foreign operations, partially offset by the reversal of approximately $3.8 million of bad debt expense in Mexico for amounts previously reserved. Network development services segment SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased 14% to $6.7 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to the reversal of bad debt expense upon the receipt of a customer payment for amounts previously reserved, partially offset by higher personnel related costs. Other SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 14% to $139.3 million. The increase was primarily due to a $12.4 million increase in corporate expenses and a $5.1 million increase in SG&A related stock-based compensation expense. The increase in corporate expenses was primarily attributable to incremental employee costs of approximately $8.7 million associated with supporting a growing global organization and a $3.7 million non-recurring state tax expense.

The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our domestic rental and management segment gross margin (14%) as described above, and was partially offset by increases in our domestic rental and management segment SG&A (11%), as described above. International rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 34% to $453.1 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our international rental and management segment gross margin (31%) as described above, and was partially offset by increases in our international rental and management segment SG&A (16%), as described above. Network development services segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 54% to $30.9 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in network development services segment gross margin and the decrease in SG&A, as described above.

The increase was primarily attributable to the depreciation, amortization and accretion associated with the acquisition or construction of approximately 19,280 sites since January 1, 2011, which resulted in an increase in property and equipment. Other Operating Expenses Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2012 2011 Other operating expenses $ 62,185 $ 58,103 $ 4,082 7 % Other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 7% to $62.2 million. This change was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately $17.0 million in impairment charges and loss on disposal of assets, which included an impairment charge of $10.8 million of one of our outdoor DAS networks, upon the termination of a tenant lease during the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately $12.9 million in acquisition related costs and non-recurring consulting and legal costs incurred in 2011 associated with our REIT Conversion. Interest Expense Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2012 2011 Interest expense $ 401,665 $ 311,854 $ 89,811 29 % Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 29% to $401.7 million. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our average debt outstanding of approximately $1,617.3 million, which was primarily used to fund our recent acquisitions, and an increase in our annualized weighted average cost of borrowing from 5.32% to 5.37%. Other Expense Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2012 2011 Other expense $ 38,300 $ 122,975 $ (84,675 ) (69 )% Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased 69% to $38.3 million. The decrease was primarily a result of a decline in unrealized currency losses of $96.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded unrealized foreign currency losses of approximately $34.3 million resulting primarily from fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates associated with our intercompany notes and similar unaffiliated balances denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies and other expenses of approximately $4.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded unrealized foreign currency losses of approximately $131.1 million and other miscellaneous income of $8.1 million. Income Tax Provision Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2012 2011 Income tax provision $ 107,304 $ 125,080 $ (17,776 ) (14 )% Effective tax rate 15.3 % 24.7 % 37 Table of Contents The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased 14% to $107.3 million. The effective tax rate (“ETR”) for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased to 15.3% from 24.7%. This decrease was primarily attributable to our dividend paid deduction and decreased state taxes during the year ended December 31, 2012, partially offset by an increase in foreign taxes and valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. The deferred tax assets arose primarily as a result of purchase accounting and existing NOLs, which were generated partly from interest on intercompany debt. As a REIT, we may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated in our QRSs and, in addition, we are able to offset income in both our TRSs and QRSs by utilizing our NOLs, subject to specified limitations. The ETR on income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our expected qualification for taxation as a REIT effective as of January 1, 2012 and to adjustments for foreign items.

The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our rental and management segments operating profit, as described above, as well as decreases in unrealized foreign currency losses and income tax provision, partially offset by increases in depreciation, amortization and accretion and interest expense. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 19% to $1,892.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our rental and management segments gross margin, and was partially offset by an increase in SG&A.

The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in both of our rental and management segments, including organic revenue growth attributable to our legacy sites and revenue growth attributable to the approximately 18,290 new communications sites, and property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators under approximately 1,810 communications sites, acquired since January 1, 2010. Domestic rental and management segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 11% to $1,744.3 million. This growth was comprised of: • Approximately 9% from organic revenue growth, which was due to the incremental revenue generated from adding new tenants to legacy sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to legacy sites, contractual rent escalations, and a positive impact from straight-line lease accounting due to extending thousands of leases with one of our major tenants, partially offset by tenant lease cancellations; and • Revenue growth of approximately 2%, which was a result of the construction or acquisition of approximately 1,420 new domestic communications sites and the acquisition of property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators under approximately 1,810 communications sites since January 1, 2010. International rental and management segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 73% to $641.9 million. This growth was comprised of: • Approximately 9% from organic revenue growth, which was due to the incremental revenue generated from adding new tenants to legacy sites, existing tenants adding more equipment to legacy sites, contractual rent escalations, a decrease in revenue reserves, the positive impact of foreign currency translation and the positive impact from straight-line lease accounting, and was partially offset by tenant lease cancellations; and • Revenue growth from new sites of approximately 64%, which was a result of the construction or acquisition of approximately 16,870 new international sites since January 1, 2010. Network development services segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 17% to $57.3 million. The increase was primarily attributable to a number of favorable one-time items.

The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue as described above, and was partially offset by a 9% increase in direct operating costs, of which 6% was attributable to expense increases on our legacy domestic sites and 3% was attributable to the incremental direct operating costs associated with the addition of approximately 1,420 new domestic sites since January 1, 2010. International rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 60% to $420.4 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue as described above, and was partially offset by a 93% increase in direct operating costs, including pass-through expenses, of which 9% was attributable to expense increases on our legacy international sites and changes in foreign currency exchange 39 Table of Contents rates, and 84% was attributable to the incremental direct operating costs associated with the addition of approximately 16,870 new international sites since January 1, 2010. Network development services segment gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 27% to $27.9 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in nonrecurring revenue described above. Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2011 2010 Rental and management Domestic $ 77,041 $ 62,295 $ 14,746 24 % International 82,106 45,877 36,229 79 Total rental and management 159,147 108,172 50,975 47 Network development services 7,864 6,312 1,552 25 Other 121,813 115,285 6,528 6 Total selling, general, administrative and development expense $ 288,824 $ 229,769 $ 59,055 26 % Total SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 26% to $288.8 million. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in both of our rental and management segments. Domestic rental and management segment SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 24% to $77.0 million. The increase was primarily attributable to initiatives designed to drive growth and to support a growing portfolio, including increased staffing in field operations, sales and finance, and other functions supporting the expansion of our business. International rental and management segment SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 79% to $82.1 million. The increase was primarily attributable to our increased international expansion initiatives in our foreign operations. Network development services segment SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 25% to $7.9 million. The increase was primarily attributable to costs incurred to support our new tower development and our site acquisition, zoning and permitting services. Other SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 6% to $121.8 million. The increase was primarily due to a $14.0 million increase in corporate expenses, which was partially offset by a $7.4 million decrease in SG&A related stock-based compensation expense. The increase in corporate expenses was primarily attributable to incremental employee and increased information technology costs associated with supporting a growing global organization. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense was primarily attributable to the capitalization of approximately $3.1 million, which is now included in property and equipment as part of our cost to construct tower assets, and the recognition of approximately $2.3 million in costs of operations during the year ended December 31, 2011. 40 Table of Contents Operating Profit Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2011 2010 Rental and management Domestic $ 1,313,761 $ 1,177,819 $ 135,942 12 % International 338,324 216,965 121,359 56 Total rental and management 1,652,085 1,394,784 257,301 18 Network development services 20,023 15,693 4,330 28 Domestic rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 12% to $1,313.8 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our domestic rental and management segment gross margin (12%) as described above, and was partially offset by increases in our domestic rental and management segment SG&A (24%), as described above. International rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 56% to $338.3 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our international rental and management segment gross margin (60%) as described above, and was partially offset by increases in our international rental and management segment SG&A (79%), as described above. Network development services segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 28% to $20.0 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in gross margin as described above.

The increase was primarily attributable to the depreciation, amortization and accretion associated with the acquisition or construction of approximately 18,290 sites since January 1, 2010, which resulted in an increase in property and equipment. Other Operating Expenses Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2011 2010 Other operating expenses $ 58,103 $ 35,876 $ 22,227 62 % Other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 62% to $58.1 million. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately $21.5 million in acquisition related costs, including contingent consideration, and consulting and legal costs associated with our REIT Conversion that are non-recurring in nature.

The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in average debt outstanding of approximately $1.4 billion, primarily attributable to our recent acquisitions, partially offset by a reduction in our annualized weighted average cost of borrowing from 5.52% to 5.32%.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded unrealized foreign currency gains of approximately $4.8 million and other miscellaneous expense of $4.5 million. Income Tax Provision Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2011 2010 Income tax provision $ 125,080 $ 182,489 $ (57,409 ) (31 )% Effective tax rate 24.7 % 32.8 % The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased 31% to $125.1 million. The ETR for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased to 24.7% from 32.8%. The decrease in ETR during the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily attributable to the impact of our reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities for assets and liabilities no longer subject to income taxes at the REIT level of $121 million, which was partially offset by an increase in the income tax provision from continuing operations. The ETRs on income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 differ from the federal statutory rate primarily attributable to adjustments for foreign items, non-deductible stock-based compensation expense, tax reserves and state taxes. 42 Table of Contents Net Income/Adjusted EBITDA Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease(Decrease) 2011 2010 Net income $ 381,840 $ 373,606 $ 8,234 2 % Income from discontinued operations, net — (30 ) (30 ) (100 ) Income from continuing operations 381,840 373,576 8,264 2 Income on equity method investments (25 ) (40 ) (15 ) (38 ) Income tax provision 125,080 182,489 (57,409 ) (31 ) Other expense (income) 122,975 (315 ) (123,290 ) N/A Loss on retirement of long-term obligations — 1,886 (1,886 ) (100 ) Interest expense 311,854 246,018 65,836 27 Interest income (7,378 ) (5,024 ) 2,354 47 Other operating expenses 58,103 35,876 22,227 62 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 555,517 460,726 94,791 21 Stock-based compensation expense 47,437 52,555 (5,118 ) (10 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,595,403 $ 1,347,747 $ 247,656 18 % Net income for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 2% to $381.8 million. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in our rental and management and network development services segment operating profit, as described above, partially offset by an increase in other expense (income), depreciation, amortization and accretion and interest expense. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 18% to $1,595.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our rental and management segments gross margin and network development services segment gross margin, and was partially offset by an increase in selling, general, administrative and development expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview As a holding company, our cash flows are derived primarily from the operations of, and distributions from, our operating subsidiaries or funds raised through borrowings under our credit facilities and debt offerings. As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately $1,103.2 million of total liquidity, comprised of $368.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to borrow up to $734.6 million, net of any outstanding letters of credit, under our $1.0 billion unsecured credit facility entered into in April 2011 (the “2011 Credit Facility”) and our $1.0 billion unsecured credit facility entered into in January 2012 (the “2012 Credit Facility”). In January 2013, we completed a registered public offering of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.50% senior unsecured notes due 2023 (“3.50% Notes”) and used the net proceeds to partially repay amounts outstanding under the 2011 Credit Facility and 2012 Credit Facility, which increased our total liquidity by $1.0 billion. Summary cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 is set forth below (in thousands). Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 Net cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 1,414,391 $ 1,165,942 $ 1,020,977 Investing activities (2,558,385 ) (2,790,812 ) (1,300,902 ) Financing activities 1,170,366 1,086,095 910,330 Net effect of changes in exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 12,055 (14,997 ) 6,265 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 38,427 $ (553,772 ) $ 636,670 43 Table of Contents We use our cash flows to fund our operations and investments in our business, including tower maintenance and improvements, communications site construction and managed network installations, and tower and land acquisitions. Additionally, we use our cash flows to make distributions of our REIT taxable income in order to maintain our REIT qualification under the Code and fund our stock repurchase program. Our significant financing transactions in 2012 included the following: • We increased our borrowing capacity by entering into the 2012 Credit Facility and a $750.0 million unsecured term loan (the “2012 Term Loan”). • We completed a registered public offering of $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.70% senior notes due 2022 (the “4.70% Notes”). • We repurchased 872,005 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $62.7 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to our stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2012, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $8.8 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and debt service obligations, as well as our required REIT distributions in 2012. We believe cash generated by our operations for the year ending December 31, 2013 will also be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures, our debt service (interest and principal repayments) obligations and REIT distribution requirements for 2013. If our pending acquisitions, capital expenditures or debt repayments exceed the cash generated by operations, we believe we have sufficient borrowing capacity under our credit facilities to fund our activities. As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately $156.8 million of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $63.6 million was held by our joint ventures. Historically, it has not been our practice to repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs. However, in the event that we do repatriate any funds, we may be required to accrue and pay taxes. As a REIT, we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income so as not to be subject to the income or excise tax on undistributed REIT taxable income. In 2012, we declared aggregate distributions of $0.90 per share and made total distributions of $355.6 million to our stockholders. We intend to continue paying regular distributions in 2013. The amount, timing and frequency of distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will be based upon various factors. See Item 5 of this Annual Report under the caption “Dividends” for a discussion of those factors considered. For more information regarding our financing transactions in 2012, see “—Cash Flows from Financing Activities” below. Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2012, cash provided by operating activities was $1,414.4 million, an increase of $248.4 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the operating profit of our rental and management segments and an increase in cash provided by working capital. This increase was partially offset by an increase in cash paid for interest and income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash provided by operating activities was $1,165.9 million, an increase of $145.0 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase was primarily comprised of an increase in the operating profit of our rental and management segments and our network development services segment, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for interest and income taxes. 44 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2012, cash used for investing activities was $2,558.4 million, a decrease of approximately $232.4 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in acquisition-related activity during the year ended December 31, 2012. During the year ended December 31, 2012, payments for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities totaled $568.0 million, including $279.0 million of capital expenditures for discretionary capital projects, such as completion of the construction of approximately 2,360 communications sites and the installation of approximately 600 shared generators domestically, $82.3 million spent to acquire land under our towers that was subject to ground agreements (including leases), $120.0 million of capital expenditures related to capital improvements and corporate capital expenditures primarily attributable to information technology improvements and $86.7 million for the redevelopment of existing sites to accommodate new tenant equipment. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2012, we spent $1,998.0 million to acquire approximately 6,450 communications sites in our served markets, approximately 24 property interests under third-party communications sites in the United States and for the payment of amounts previously recognized in accounts payable or accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets for communications sites we acquired in Chile, Colombia, Ghana and South Africa during the year ended December 31, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash used for investing activities was $2,790.8 million, an increase of approximately $1,489.9 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase was primarily comprised of increased spending for acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2011. During the year ended December 31, 2011, payments for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities totaled $523.0 million, including $296.9 million of capital expenditures for discretionary capital projects, such as completion of the construction of approximately 1,850 communications sites, $91.3 million spent to acquire land under our towers that was subject to ground agreements (including leases), $79.5 million of capital expenditures related to capital improvements and corporate capital expenditures primarily attributable to information technology improvements and $55.3 million for the redevelopment of existing sites to accommodate new tenant equipment. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2011, we spent $2,320.7 million to acquire approximately 8,620 communications sites in the United States, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ghana, Mexico and South Africa and approximately 2,150 property interests under communications sites in the United States. We plan to continue to allocate our available capital after our REIT distribution requirements among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria. Accordingly, we expect to continue to deploy our discretionary capital through our annual discretionary capital expenditure program, including land purchases and new site construction and through acquisitions. We expect that our 2013 total capital expenditures will be between approximately $550 million and $650 million, including between $130 million and $140 million for capital improvements and corporate capital expenditures, between $95 and $105 million for the redevelopment of existing communications sites, between $85 million and $105 million for ground lease purchases and between $240 million and $300 million for other discretionary capital projects including the construction of approximately 2,250 to 2,750 new communications sites. Cash Flows from Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2012, cash provided by financing activities was $1,170.4 million, as compared to $1,086.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2011. Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily due to (i) borrowings under the 2011 Credit Facility of $890.0 million, (ii) borrowings under the 2012 Credit Facility of $1,692.0 million, (iii) net proceeds from our 2012 Term Loan of $746.4 million, (iv) net proceeds from our registered offering of 4.70% Notes of $693.0 million, (v) proceeds from other long-term borrowings of $177.3 million, (vi) proceeds of $55.4 million from the exercise of stock options and (vii) net contributions from non-controlling interest holders of $52.8 million. 45 Table of Contents These borrowings were partially offset by repayment of (i) $1.0 billion under our $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), (ii) $700.0 million under the 2012 Credit Facility, (iii) $625.0 million under the 2011 Credit Facility (iv) $325.0 million of term loan commitments (the “2008 Term Loan”), and (v) net short-term borrowings of $55.3 million. In addition, we made distributions to our stockholders in the aggregate of $355.6 million and we paid $62.7 million for the repurchase of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash provided by financing activities was $1,086.1 million, as compared to cash provided by financing activities of approximately $910.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The $1,086.1 million of cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2011 partially relates to borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility of $925.0 million, net proceeds from our registered offering of the 5.90% senior notes due 2021 (the “5.90% Notes”) of $495.2 million, proceeds from other long-term borrowings of $212.8 million, proceeds from short-term borrowings of $128.1 million, proceeds from stock options, warrants and stock purchase plans of $85.6 million and borrowings under our other credit facilities of $80.0 million. These borrowings were partially offset by payments for the repurchase of our common stock of $437.4 million, which consisted of $426.1 million of stock repurchases under our stock repurchase programs ($423.9 million, including commissions and fees, and a decrease in accrued treasury stock of $2.2 million) and $11.2 million of amounts surrendered for the satisfaction of employee tax obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units, repayment of notes payable, amounts outstanding under our credit facilities and capital leases of $395.4 million and distributions to stockholders of $137.8 million in connection with the one-time special cash distribution to our stockholders in December 2011. Revolving Credit Facility and 2008 Term Loan. On January 31, 2012, we repaid and terminated the Revolving Credit Facility and repaid the 2008 Term Loan with proceeds from borrowings under the 2011 Credit Facility and the 2012 Credit Facility. 2011 Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2012, we had $265.0 million outstanding under the 2011 Credit Facility and had approximately $5.7 million of undrawn letters of credit. On January 8, 2013, we repaid the amount outstanding with net proceeds received from the offering of the 3.50% Notes. We continue to maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the 2011 Credit Facility in the ordinary course. The 2011 Credit Facility has a term of five years and matures on April 8, 2016. The current margin over London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) that we would incur on borrowings is 1.850% and the current commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the 2011 Credit Facility is 0.350%. As of February 11, 2013, there were no amounts outstanding under the 2011 Credit Facility. 2012 Credit Facility. On January 31, 2012, we entered into the 2012 Credit Facility. The 2012 Credit Facility has a term of five years and matures on January 31, 2017. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The 2012 Credit Facility may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. We have the option of choosing either a defined base rate or LIBOR as the applicable base rate for borrowings under the 2012 Credit Facility. The interest rate ranges between 1.075% to 2.400% above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.075% to 1.400% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based upon our debt ratings. A quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the 2012 Credit Facility is required, ranging from 0.125% to 0.450% per annum, based upon our debt ratings. The current margin over LIBOR that we would incur on borrowings is 1.625%, and the current commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the 2012 Credit Facility is 0.225%. The loan agreement contains certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply. Any failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreement would not only 46 Table of Contents prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds, but would constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. As of December 31, 2012, we had $992.0 million outstanding under the 2012 Credit Facility and had approximately $2.7 million of undrawn letters of credit. On January 8, 2013, we repaid $719.0 million of the amount outstanding with net proceeds received from the offering of the 3.50% Notes and cash on hand. We continue to maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the 2012 Credit Facility in the ordinary course. As of February 11, 2013, we had $422.0 million drawn under the 2012 Credit Facility. 2012 Term Loan. On June 29, 2012, we entered into the 2012 Term Loan. We received net proceeds of approximately $746.4 million, of which $632.0 million were used to repay certain existing indebtedness under the 2012 Credit Facility. The 2012 Term Loan has a term of five years and matures on June 29, 2017. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The 2012 Term Loan may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. We have the option of choosing either a defined base rate or LIBOR as the applicable base rate. The interest rate ranges between 1.25% to 2.50% above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.25% to 1.50% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based upon our debt ratings. As of December 31, 2012, the interest rate under the 2012 Term Loan is LIBOR plus 1.75%. The loan agreement contains certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply. Any failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreement would constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. As of December 31, 2012, we had $750.0 million outstanding under the 2012 Term Loan. Colombian Short-Term Credit Facility. The 141.1 billion Colombian Peso (“COP”) denominated short-term credit facility (the “Colombian Short-Term Credit Facility”) was executed by one of our Colombian subsidiaries (“ATC Sitios”), on July 25, 2011, to refinance the credit facility entered into in connection with the purchase of the exclusive use rights for towers from Telefónica S.A.’s Colombian subsidiary, Colombia Telecomunicaciones S.A. E.S.P. On November 30, 2012, the Colombian Short-Term Credit Facility was repaid in full with proceeds from the Colombian Long-Term Credit Facility, described below. Colombian Long-Term Credit Facility. On October 19, 2012, ATC Sitios entered into a loan agreement for a COP denominated long-term credit facility (the “Colombian Long-Term Credit Facility”), which it used to refinance the Colombian Short-Term Credit Facility on November 30, 2012. The Colombian Long-Term Credit Facility generally matures on November 30, 2020, subject to earlier maturity as a result of any mandatory prepayments. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The Colombian Long-Term Credit Facility may be prepaid in whole or in part, subject to certain limitations and prepayment consideration, at any time. Under the terms of the Colombian Long-Term Credit Facility, ATC Sitios paid the lenders a one-time structuring fee and upfront fee of 2.9 billion COP (approximately $1.6 million), including value added tax. Principal and interest are payable quarterly in arrears with principal due in accordance with the repayment schedule included in the loan agreement. Interest accrues at a per annum rate equal to 5% above the quarterly advanced Inter-bank Rate (“IBR”) in effect at the beginning of each Interest Period (as defined in the loan agreement). The interest rate in effect at December 31, 2012 was 9.10%. 47 Table of Contents The Colombian Long-Term Credit Facility is secured by, among other things, liens on towers owned by ATC Sitios. The loan agreement contains certain reporting, information, financial ratios and operating covenants. Failure to comply with certain of the financial and operating covenants would constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. The loan agreement also requires that ATC Sitios manage exposure to variability in interest rates on at least fifty percent of the amounts outstanding under the Colombian Long-Term Credit Facility for the first four years of the loan, and seventy-five percent thereafter. Accordingly, ATC Sitios entered into interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of 101.3 billion COP (approximately $57.3 million) with certain of the lenders under the Colombian Long-Term Credit Facility on December 5, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, 135.0 billion COP (approximately $76.3 million) were outstanding under the Colombian Long-Term Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2012, the interest rate, after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements, was 10.36%. Colombian Bridge Loans. In connection with the acquisition of communications sites from Colombia Movil S.A. E.S.P., another of our Colombian subsidiaries entered into five COP denominated bridge loans. As of December 31, 2012, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under these bridge loans was 94.0 billion COP (approximately $53.2 million). As of December 31, 2012, the bridge loans had an interest rate of 7.99% and mature on June 22, 2013. Colombian Loan. In connection with the establishment of our joint venture with Millicom International Cellular S.A. (“Millicom”) and the acquisition of certain communications sites in Colombia, ATC Colombia B.V., a 60% owned subsidiary of American Tower, entered into a U.S. Dollar-denominated shareholder loan agreement (the “Colombian Loan”), as the borrower, with our wholly owned subsidiary (the “ATC Colombian Subsidiary”), and a wholly owned subsidiary of Millicom (the “Millicom Subsidiary”), as the lenders. The Colombian Loan accrues interest at 8.30% and matures on February 22, 2022. The portion of the Colombian Loan made by the ATC Colombian Subsidiary is eliminated in consolidation, and the portion of the Colombian Loan made by the Millicom Subsidiary is reported as outstanding debt of American Tower. As of December 31, 2012, an aggregate of $19.2 million was payable to the Millicom Subsidiary. South African Facility. Our 1.2 billion South African Rand (“ZAR”) denominated credit facility (“South African Facility”) was executed in November 2011 to refinance the bridge loan entered into in connection with the acquisition of communications sites from Cell C (Pty) Limited by our local South African subsidiaries (“SA Borrower”). The South African Facility is secured by, among other things, liens on towers owned by one of our South African subsidiaries. On August 8, 2012 and September 14, 2012, we borrowed an additional 123.0 million ZAR (approximately $15.1 million) and 24.2 million ZAR (approximately $2.9 million), respectively. The South African Facility generally matures on March 31, 2020, subject to earlier maturity resulting from repayment increases tied either to SA Borrower’s excess cash flows or permitted distributions to SA Borrower’s parent. Principal and interest are payable quarterly in arrears with principal due in accordance with the repayment schedule included in the loan agreement. Interest accrues at a rate equal to 3.75% per annum, plus the three month Johannesburg Interbank Agreed Rate (“JIBAR”). The interest rate in effect at December 31, 2012 was 8.88%. We entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to variability in interest rates. As of December 31, 2012, 834.3 million ZAR (approximately $98.5 million) was outstanding under the South African Facility, and after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements, the facility accrues interest at a weighted average rate of 9.84%. Ghana Loan. In connection with the establishment of our joint venture with MTN Group Limited (“MTN Group”) and acquisitions of communications sites in Ghana, Ghana Tower Interco B.V., a 51% owned subsidiary of American Tower, entered into a U.S. Dollar-denominated shareholder loan agreement (“Ghana Loan”), as the borrower, with our wholly owned subsidiary (“ATC Ghana Subsidiary”) and Mobile Telephone Networks (Netherlands) B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of MTN Group (the “MTN Ghana Subsidiary”), as the lenders. Pursuant to the terms of the Ghana Loan, loans were made to the joint venture in connection with the acquisition of communications sites from MTN Ghana. The Ghana Loan accrues interest at 9.0% and matures on May 4, 48 Table of Contents 2016. The portion of the loans made by the ATC Ghana Subsidiary is eliminated in consolidation and the portion of the loans made by the MTN Ghana Subsidiary is reported as outstanding debt of American Tower. As of December 31, 2012, an aggregate of $131.0 million was payable to the MTN Ghana Subsidiary. Uganda Loan. In connection with the establishment of our joint venture with MTN Group and acquisitions of communications sites in Uganda, Uganda Tower Interco B.V., a 51% owned subsidiary of American Tower, entered into a U.S. Dollar-denominated shareholder loan agreement (the “Uganda Loan”), as the borrower, with our wholly owned subsidiary (the “ATC Uganda Subsidiary”), and a wholly owned subsidiary of MTN Group (the “MTN Uganda Subsidiary”), as the lenders. The Uganda Loan matures on June 29, 2019 and accrues interest at 5.30% above LIBOR, reset annually, which as of December 31, 2012 was 6.368%. The portion of the Uganda Loan made by the ATC Uganda Subsidiary is eliminated in consolidation, and the portion of the Uganda Loan made by the MTN Uganda Subsidiary is reported as outstanding debt of American Tower. As of December 31, 2012, an aggregate of $61.0 million was payable to the MTN Uganda Subsidiary. Senior Notes Offerings. On March 12, 2012, we completed a registered public offering of $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.70% Notes. The net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately $693.0 million, after deducting commissions and expenses. We used the net proceeds to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness incurred under the 2011 Credit Facility and the 2012 Credit Facility, which had been used to fund recent acquisitions. On January 8, 2013, we completed a registered public offering of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our 3.50% Notes. The net proceeds to us from the offering were approximately $983.4 million, after deducting commissions and expenses. We used $265.0 million of the net proceeds to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the 2011 Credit Facility and $718.4 million to partially repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the 2012 Credit Facility. The 4.70% Notes mature on March 15, 2022, and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15. We began making interest payments on the 4.70% Notes on September 15, 2012. The 3.50% Notes mature on January 31, 2023, and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 31 and July 31 of each year. We will begin making interest payments on the 3.50% Notes on July 31, 2013. We may redeem the 4.70% Notes or the 3.50% Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date. Interest on the 4.70% Notes began to accrue on March 12, 2012 and interest on the 3.50% Notes began to accrue on January 8, 2013, and each is computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. If we undergo a change of control and ratings decline (each as defined in the indentures governing the 4.70% Notes and the 3.50% Notes), we will be required to offer to repurchase all of the 4.70% Notes and 3.50% Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to but not including the repurchase date. Each of the 4.70% Notes and the 3.50% Notes rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries. The indentures contain certain covenants that restrict our ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and our (together with our subsidiaries’) ability to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that we and our subsidiaries may incur certain liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness, if the aggregate amount of such liens does not exceed 3.5x Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the indentures. Stock Repurchase Program. In March 2011, our Board of Directors approved the 2011 Buyback, pursuant to which we are authorized to purchase up to $1.5 billion of common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we repurchased 872,005 shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $62.7 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the 2011 Buyback. As of December 31, 2012, we had repurchased a total of approximately 4.3 million shares of our common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $243.9 million, including commissions and fees. 49 Table of Contents Between January 1, 2013 and January 21, 2013, we repurchased an additional 15,790 shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $1.2 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the 2011 Buyback. As of January 21, 2013, we had repurchased a total of approximately 4.3 million shares of our common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $245.2 million, including commissions and fees. Under the 2011 Buyback, we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. To facilitate repurchases, we make purchases pursuant to trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, which allow us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. We expect to continue to manage the pacing of the remaining $1.3 billion under the 2011 Buyback in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors. In the near term, we expect to fund any further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Purchases under the 2011 Buyback are subject to us having available cash to fund repurchases. Sales of Equity Securities. We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plans. For the year ended December 31, 2012, we received an aggregate of $55.4 million in proceeds from sales of shares pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan and upon exercises of stock options. Distributions. As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income so as to not be subject to income tax or excise tax on undistributed REIT taxable income. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions, however, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will be declared based upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain REIT status and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we paid an aggregate of $355.6 million in regular cash distributions to our stockholders, which included our fourth quarter distribution of approximately $94.8 million to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 17, 2012. For detail on the other regular cash distributions paid to our stockholders during 2012, see Item 5 of this Annual Report under the caption “Dividends.” We will accrue distributions on unvested restricted stock unit awards granted subsequent to January 1, 2012, which will be payable upon vesting. As of December 31, 2012, we had accrued $0.7 million of distributions payable upon the vesting of restricted stock units. 50 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations. Our contractual obligations relate primarily to the Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-1 issued in our May 2007 securitization transaction (the “Securitization”), borrowings under our credit facilities, our outstanding notes and our operating leases related to the ground under our towers. The following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations payable in cash as of December 31, 2012 (in thousands): Contractual Obligations 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter Total Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-1(1) $ — $ 1,750,000 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 1,750,000 2011 Credit Facility(2) — — — 265,000 — — 265,000 2012 Credit Facility(2) — — — — 992,000 — 992,000 2012 Term Loan — — — — 750,000 — 750,000 Unison Notes, Series 2010-1 Class C, Series 2010-2 Class C and Series 2010-2 Class F notes(3) — — — — 67,000 129,000 196,000 Colombian Long-Term CreditFacility(4) — 763 3,054 10,689 12,216 49,625 76,347 Colombian Bridge Loans(5) 53,169 — — — — — 53,169 Colombian Loan(6) — — — — — 19,176 19,176 South African Facility(7) 2,461 5,957 11,322 15,753 17,722 45,241 98,456 Ghana Loan(6) — — — 130,951 — — 130,951 Uganda Loan(6) — — — — — 61,023 61,023 4.625% senior notes — — 600,000 — — — 600,000 7.00% senior notes — — — — 500,000 — 500,000 4.50% senior notes — — — — — 1,000,000 1,000,000 7.25% senior notes — — — — — 300,000 300,000 5.05% senior notes — — — — — 700,000 700,000 5.90% senior notes — — — — — 500,000 500,000 4.70% senior notes — — — — — 700,000 700,000 Long-term obligations, excluding capital leases 55,630 1,756,720 614,376 422,393 2,338,938 3,504,065 8,692,122 Cash interest expense 398,000 342,000 295,000 284,000 214,000 448,000 1,981,000 Capital lease payments (including interest) 8,242 7,316 5,377 5,485 4,897 164,520 195,837 Total debt service obligations 461,872 2,106,036 914,753 711,878 2,557,835 4,116,585 10,868,959 Operating leasepayments(8) 364,427 352,624 343,478 328,826 317,533 2,878,866 4,585,754 Other non-current liabilities(9)(10) 506 21,895 4,967 18,690 1,632 1,541,956 1,589,646 Total $ 826,805 $ 2,480,555 $ 1,263,198 $ 1,059,394 $ 2,877,000 $ 8,537,407 $ 17,044,359 (1) Anticipated repayment date; final legal maturity date is April 2037. (2) On January 8, 2013, we repaid $265.0 million outstanding under our 2011 Credit Facility and $719.0 million outstanding under our 2012 Credit Facility with proceeds from the 3.50% Notes and cash on hand. 51 Table of Contents (3) The Unison Notes, Series 2010-1 Class C, Series 2010-2 Class C and Series 2010-2 Class F notes were assumed by us in connection with the Unison Acquisition, and have anticipated repayment dates of April 15, 2017, April 15, 2020 and April 15, 2020, respectively, and a final maturity date of April 15, 2040. (4) The Colombian Long-Term Credit Facility is denominated in Colombian Pesos. (5) The Colombian Bridge Loans are denominated in Colombian Pesos. The maturity dates may be extended from time to time. (6) Denominated in U.S. Dollars. (7) The South African Facility is denominated in South African Rand. (8) Operating lease payments include payments to be made under non-cancellable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that we will renew the lease. (9) Primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other non-current liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily our straight-line rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash. (10) Other non-current liabilities exclude $34.3 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and $28.7 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled. Settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe. However, based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements, we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Interest Rate Swap Agreements. As of December 31, 2012, we held ten interest rate swap agreements, all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges, and which had an aggregate notional amount of $107.3 million, interest rates ranging from 5.78% to 7.25% and expiration dates through November 2020. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Internally Generated Funds. Because the majority of our tenant leases are multi-year contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management operations as of the end of 2012 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites. Restrictions Under Loan Agreements Relating to the 2011 Credit Facility, the 2012 Credit Facility and the 2012 Term Loan. The loan agreements for the 2011 Credit Facility, the 2012 Credit Facility and the 2012 Term Loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and all of our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreements also contain covenants that establish three financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage, senior secured leverage and interest coverage, as set forth below. Where we designate 52 Table of Contents certain of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries in accordance with the respective agreements, those subsidiaries are excluded for purposes of the covenant calculations. As of December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. • Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (each as defined in the loan agreements) of 6.00 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the 12 months ended December 31, 2012, we could incur approximately $2.5 billion of additional indebtedness and still remain in compliance with this ratio. In addition, if we maintain our existing debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $412 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. • Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of Senior Secured Debt (as defined in the loan agreements) to Adjusted EBITDA of 3.00 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the 12 months ended December 31, 2012, we could incur approximately $3.4 billion of additional Senior Secured Debt and still remain in compliance with this ratio, (effectively, however, this ratio would be limited to $2.5 billion to remain in compliance with other covenants). In addition, if we maintain our existing Senior Secured Debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $1.1 billion and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. • Interest Coverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we maintain a ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense (as defined in the loan agreements) of not less than 2.50 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the 12 months ended December 31, 2012, our interest expense, which was $391 million for that period, could increase by approximately $356 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. In addition, if our interest expense does not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $891 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. The loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants. Any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but would constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for the credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next twelve months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. Restrictions Under Loan Agreement Relating to the Securitization. The loan agreement related to the Securitization involves assets related to 5,295 broadcast and wireless communications towers owned by two special purpose subsidiaries of the Company (the “Borrowers”), through a private offering of $1.75 billion of Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-1 (the “Certificates”). As of December 31, 2012, 5,278 broadcast and wireless communications towers are owned by the two special purpose subsidiaries. The Securitization loan agreement includes certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the Borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets. The Borrowers’ organizational documents contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities, including the requirement that the Borrowers maintain at least two independent 53 Table of Contents directors. The Securitization loan agreement also contains certain covenants that require the Borrowers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets, promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the Securitization loan agreement and other agreements related to the towers subject to the Securitization, and allow the trustee reasonable access to the towers, including the right to conduct site investigations. Under the terms of the Securitization loan agreement, the loan will be paid solely from the cash flows generated by the towers subject to the Securitization, which must be deposited, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the Securitization loan. The Borrowers are required to make monthly payments of interest on the Securitization loan. On a monthly basis, all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, to fund required reserves, to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the Securitization loan, referred to as excess cash flow, is to be released to the Borrowers for distribution to us. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Borrowers distributed excess cash to us of approximately $576.8 million. In order to distribute this excess cash flow to us, the Borrowers must maintain several specified ratios with respect to their debt service coverage (“DSCR”). For this purpose, DSCR is tested as of the last day of each calendar quarter and is generally defined as four times the Borrowers’ net cash flow for that quarter divided by the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees that the Borrowers must pay over the succeeding 12 months on the Securitization loan. Pursuant to one such test, if the DSCR as of the end of any calendar quarter were 1.75x or less (the “Cash Trap DSCR”), then all excess cash flow would be placed in a reserve account and would not be released to the Borrowers for distribution to us until the DSCR exceeded the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. Additionally, while the anticipated repayment date is not until April 2014, excess cash flow would be applied to principal during an “Amortization Period” under the Securitization loan until April 2014. An “Amortization Period” would commence under the Securitization loan if the DSCR as of the end of any calendar quarter fell below 1.45x (the “Minimum DSCR”). In such a case, all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve account because the Cash Trap DSCR was not met would be applied to pay principal of the Securitization loan on each monthly payment date until the DSCR exceeded the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Consequently, a failure to comply with the covenants in the Securitization loan agreement could prevent the Borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers. Additionally, a failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent the Borrowers from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our discretionary expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions, pay REIT distribution requirements and fund our stock repurchase program. In addition, if the Borrowers were to default on the loan related to the Securitization, the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the Securitization, in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers. As of December 31, 2012, the Borrowers’ DSCR was 3.89x. Based on the Borrowers’ net cash flow for the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2012 and the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding 12 months on the Securitization loan, the Borrowers could endure a reduction of approximately $211.3 million in net cash flow before triggering a Cash Trap DSCR, and approximately $240.9 million in net cash flow before triggering an Amortization Period. As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness. In addition, in order to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and fund our stock repurchase program, we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities. If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to 54 Table of Contents raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements, refinance our existing indebtedness or fund our stock repurchase program. In addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under the caption “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and, consequently, a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to impairment of assets, asset retirement obligations, accounting for acquisitions, revenue recognition, rent expense, stock-based compensation and income taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2012. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. • Impairment of Assets—Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization: We review long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable. We review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indications of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements. To the extent that cash flows generated under this approach are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the towers, an impairment charge is recognized for the towers and network location intangible assets. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment. We monitor our customer-related intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indications of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts, or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of the customer-related intangible assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows. If we determine that the carrying value of the customer-related intangible asset may not be recoverable, we measure any impairment based on the fair value of the asset as determined by the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset, as compared to the asset’s carrying value. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment. 55 Table of Contents • Impairment of Assets—Goodwill: We review goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is recorded in our domestic and international rental and management segments and network development services segment. We utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment. When conducting this test, we employ a discounted cash flow analysis. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. Under the first step of this test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying value of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we conduct the second step of this test, in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized. During the year ended December 31, 2012, no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test. The fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying value and passed with a substantial margin; except for two reporting units, whose fair value exceed the carrying value by approximately $87.2 million. For these two reporting units, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that none of the following negative changes in our assumptions individually, which we determined to be reasonable, would impact our conclusions: • A 5% reduction in projected net income, or a 110 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital, or a 15% reduction in terminal sales growth rate. The goodwill recorded in these two reporting units approximated $41.9 million as of December 31, 2012, and is the result of recently completed acquisitions. Accordingly, the sensitivity of projections to changes in the various assumptions is due, in part, to the timing of the underlying acquisitions(s), current levels of cash flows and amounts of cash flows generated in excess of the planned amounts. Due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the measurement date, the fair value of intangible assets and goodwill used to test for impairment is in line with the fair value used to initially measure the business. • Asset Retirement Obligations: We recognize asset retirement obligations associated with our obligation to retire tangible long-lived assets and the related asset retirement costs, which are principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of our tower assets are located, in the period in which they are incurred, if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made, and we accrete such liability through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. The associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives or captured as a component of purchase accounting. We updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of $6.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2012. The change in 2012 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows, and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense. The significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary. 56 Table of Contents • Acquisitions: For those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, we allocate the purchase price, including any contingent consideration, to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition with any excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. For those transactions that do not meet the definition of a business combination, we allocate the purchase price to property and equipment for the fair value of the towers and to identifiable intangible assets (primarily acquired customer-related and network location intangibles). The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future customer cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition. The determination of the final purchase price and acquisition-date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed may extend over more than one period and result in adjustments to the preliminary estimate recognized. • Revenue Recognition: Rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned and when collectability is reasonably assured, regardless of whether the payments from the tenants are received in equal monthly amounts. Fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease agreements, excluding those tied to the Consumer Price Index or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants are recognized on a straight-line basis over the fixed, non-cancellable terms of the applicable leases. Total rental and management straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 approximated $165.8 million, $144.0 million and $105.2 million, respectively. Amounts billed up-front for certain services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases. Amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition has been met. We derive the largest portion of our revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, and approximately 51% of our revenues are derived from four tenants in the industry. In addition, we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. We mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of our borrowers and tenants. In recognizing customer revenue we must assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectability of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense. Accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured. • Rent Expense: Many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time. We calculate straight-line ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. Certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease, if the tenant exercises its renewal option. For towers with these types of tenant leases at the inception of the ground lease, we calculate our straight-line ground rent over the term of the ground lease, including all renewal options required 57 Table of Contents to fulfill the tenant lease obligation. In addition to the straight-line ground rent expense recorded, we also record an associated straight-line rent liability in other non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Leases may contain complex terms that often are subject to interpretation. • Stock-Based Compensation: We measure stock-based compensation cost at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and the fair value is recognized as an expense over the service period, which generally represents the vesting period. The expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will not fully vest and be forfeited. The fair value of a stock option is determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that takes into account a number of assumptions at the accounting measurement date including the stock price, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock, the expected distributions, and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. These assumptions are highly subjective and could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the compensation expense. The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. We recognize stock-based compensation in either selling, general, administrative and development expense, costs of operations or as part of the costs associated with the construction of our tower assets. • Income Taxes: We will elect to be taxed as a REIT under the Code effective January 1, 2012, and will generally not be subject to federal and state income taxes on our QRSs’ taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders provided we meet certain organization and operating requirements. However, even as a REIT, we will remain obligated to pay income taxes on earnings from our TRS assets. In addition, our international assets and operations continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted. Accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes. To the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for book purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax purposes, deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns, which may differ from the current rate. At December 31, 2011, we reversed deferred tax assets and liabilities related to our REIT activities as a result of a reduction of the expected tax rate. As a REIT, we will not pay federal income tax on our QRSs, because a dividends paid deduction will be available to offset our taxable income. Additionally, we will be permitted to use NOLs to offset our REIT taxable income. We do not expect to pay federal taxes on our REIT taxable income. We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2012, we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $95.6 million on deferred tax assets for certain of our subsidiaries, which primarily relates to foreign NOLs. We have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax asset, primarily our foreign and federal NOLs related to other TRS entities, as we believe that we will have sufficient taxable income to realize these NOLs during the applicable carryforward period. Valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability. The recoverability of our U.S. federal net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing projections based on our current operations. Accordingly, the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material asset sales or other non-routine transactions. Based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period, management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future, we will be required to reassess our deferred tax assets and consider an adjustment to our valuation allowances. 58 Table of Contents Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination, which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe, or if the applicable statute of limitations lapses. We believe that the amount of the change could range from zero to $1.3 million. As of December 31, 2012, we have classified approximately $34.3 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions as other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. We also classified approximately $28.7 million of accrued income tax-related interest and penalties as other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2012. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws, regulations and administrative practices in a multitude of jurisdictions across our operations. From time to time, we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations, and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations. We believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through December 31, 2012. We consider the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. We have not recorded a deferred tax liability related to the U.S. federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $101 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside of the United States. Should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, we may have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside of the United States. 59 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

As of December 31, 2012, fixed rate debt consisted of: the Certificates issued in the Securitization ($1.75 billion); Unison Notes ($196.0 million principal amount due at maturity, the balance as of December 31, 2012 was $207.2 million); the 7.25% senior notes due 2019 ($300.0 million principal amount due at maturity, the balance as of December 31, 2012 was $296.3 million); the 7.00% senior notes due 2017 ($500.0 million); the 4.625% senior notes due 2015 ($600.0 million principal amount due at maturity, the balance as of December 31, 2012 was $599.6 million); the 5.05% senior notes due 2020 ($700.0 million principal amount due at maturity, the balance as of December 31, 2012 was $699.3 million); the 4.50% senior notes due 2018 ($1.0 billion principal amount due at maturity, the balance as of December 31, 2012 was $999.4 million); the 5.90% Notes ($500.0 million principal amount due at maturity, the balance as of December 31, 2012 was $499.4 million); the 4.70% Notes ($700.0 million principal amount due at maturity, the balance as of December 31, 2012 was $698.8 million), and other debt of $260.6 million (including the Colombian Bridge Loans, Colombian Loan and Ghana Loan and other debt including capital leases). Interest on the 2011 Credit Facility, the 2012 Credit Facility and the 2012 Term Loan is payable in accordance with the applicable LIBOR agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2012 for the 2011 Credit Facility, the 2012 Credit Facility and the 2012 Term Loan was 1.92%. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the weighted average interest rate under the 2011 Credit Facility, the 2012 Credit Facility and the 2012 Term Loan was 1.82%. Interest on the South African Facility is payable in accordance with the applicable JIBAR agreement and accrues at JIBAR plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2012, after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements in South Africa, was 9.84%. Interest on the Colombian Long-Term Credit Facility is payable in accordance with the applicable IBR agreement and accrues at IBR plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2012, after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements in Colombia, was 10.36%. Interest on the Uganda Loan is payable in accordance with the applicable LIBOR plus margin (as defined). The Uganda Loan accrued interest at 6.368% at December 31, 2012. 60 Table of Contents (b) Represents the weighted average fixed rate of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts. (c) As of December 31, 2011, variable rate debt consisted of our Revolving Credit Facility ($1.0 billion drawn) and the 2008 Term Loan ($325.0 million) included above which originally matured on June 8, 2012, but we repaid on January 31, 2012 with $625.0 million in proceeds from the 2011 Credit Facility, which matures on April 8, 2016, and $700 million in proceeds from the 2012 Credit Facility, which matures on January 31, 2017. Variable rate debt also includes $84.9 million of indebtedness outstanding under our South African Facility which matures on March 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2011, fixed rate debt consisted of: the Certificates issued in the Securitization ($1.75 billion); Unison Notes ($196.0 million principal amount due at maturity, the balance as of December 31, 2011 was $209.3 million); the 7.25% senior notes due 2019 ($300.0 million principal amount due at maturity, the balance as of December 31, 2011 was $295.8 million); the 7.00% senior notes due 2017 ($500.0 million); the 4.625% senior notes due 2015 ($600.0 million principal amount due at maturity, the balance as of December 31, 2011 was $599.5 million); the 5.05% senior notes due 2020 ($700.0 million principal amount due at maturity, the balance as of December 31, 2011 was $699.3 million); the 4.50% senior notes due 2018 ($1.0 billion principal amount due at maturity, the balance as of December 31, 2011 was $999.3 million); the 5.90% Notes ($500.0 million principal amount due at maturity, the balance as of December 31, 2011 was $499.3 million); and other debt of $273.9 million (including the Colombian Bridge Loan, Colombian Short-Term Credit Facility and Ghana Loan). Interest on the Revolving Credit Facility and the 2008 Term Loan was payable in accordance with the applicable LIBOR agreement or quarterly and accrued at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The weighted-average interest rate in effect at December 31, 2011 for the Revolving Credit Facility and the 2008 Term Loan was 0.95%. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the weighted average interest rate under the Revolving Credit Facility and the 2008 Term Loan was 1.71%. As of December 31, 2012, we held ten interest rate swap agreements, all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges, and which had an aggregate notional amount of $107.3 million, interest rates ranging from 5.78% to 7.25% and expiration dates through November 2020. Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2012, was comprised of $265.0 million under the 2011 Credit Facility, $992.0 million under the 2012 Credit Facility, $750.0 million under the 2012 Term Loan, $61.0 million under the Uganda Loan, $48.5 million under the South African Facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements in South Africa and $19.1 million under the Colombian Long-Term Credit Facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements in Colombia. A 10% increase in current interest rates would result in an additional $4.8 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012. We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar is reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity and as a component of comprehensive income (loss). We may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions in order to minimize the risk of currency fluctuations. For the year ended December 31, 2012, approximately 30% of our revenues and approximately 39% of our operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies, as compared to 26% and 34% respectively, during the same period in 2011. We have performed sensitivity analyses assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2012 and 2011. As of December 31, 2012, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate by less than 5%. As of December 31, 2011, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate by less than 4%. As of December 31, 2012, we have incurred a substantial amount of additional intercompany debt, which is not considered to be permanently reinvested, and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As this debt had not been designated as being of long-term investment in nature, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. An adverse 61 Table of Contents change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in approximately $188.8 million of unrealized gains or losses that would be included in other (expense) income in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012.",2023-12-30 19:23:18.329369
1053507,AMT,AMERICAN TOWER CORP /MA/,2014,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements herein and the accompanying notes thereto, and the information set forth under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” below. Our continuing operations are reported in three segments, domestic rental and management, international rental and management and network development services. Among other factors, management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit in its assessment of operating performance in each business segment. We define segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in costs of operations; Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expense. We define segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. Segment gross margin and segment operating profit for the international rental and management segment also include Interest income, TV Azteca, net (see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included herein). These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before Interest income, Interest expense, Loss on retirement of long-term obligations, Other income (expense), Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest, Income (loss) on equity method investments and Income tax provision (benefit). Executive Overview Our primary business is leasing antenna space on multi-tenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data and data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. We refer to this business as our rental and management operations, which accounted for approximately 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 and includes our domestic rental and management segment and our international rental and management segment. Through our network development services, we offer tower-related services domestically, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services, which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. We began operating as a REIT for federal income tax purposes effective January 1, 2012. 28 Table of Contents The following table details the number of communications sites we owned or operated as of December 31, 2013: Country Number ofOwned Sites Number ofOperated Sites(1) United States 20,795 7,224 International: Brazil 6,609 155 Chile 1,154 — Colombia 2,755 706 Costa Rica 456 — Germany 2,031 — Ghana 1,979 — India 11,542 — Mexico 8,194 199 Panama 57 — Peru 498 — South Africa 1,900 — Uganda 1,164 — (1) All of the communications sites we operate are held pursuant to long-term capital leases, including those subject to purchase options. The majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers have an initial non-cancellable term of five to ten years, with multiple five-year renewal terms. Accordingly, nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended December 31, 2013 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2013, we expect to generate approximately $23 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, absent the impact of straight-line lease accounting. Most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually based on a fixed escalation (approximately 3.0%-3.5% in the United States) or an inflationary index in our international markets. The revenues generated by our rental and management operations may also be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multi-year contracts, which typically are non-cancellable; however in some instances, a lease may be canceled upon the payment of a termination fee. Revenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their terms or rent negotiations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management operations. During the year ended December 31, 2013, loss of annual revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented less than 1.5% of our rental and management operations revenues. Rental and Management Operations Revenue Growth. Our rental and management revenue growth is comprised of (i) growth in organic revenue, which is revenue from sites that existed in our portfolio as of the beginning of the prior year period (“legacy sites”) and (ii) growth from sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior year period (“new sites”). The primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our domestic and international rental and management segments are: • Recurring revenues from tenant leases generated from legacy sites; • Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of cancellations; • New revenue generated from leasing additional space on our legacy sites; and • New revenue generated from new sites. 29 Table of Contents We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for wireless real estate by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our legacy sites, which increases these sites’ utilization and profitability. In addition, we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers. Our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks, while also deploying next generation wireless technologies. In addition, consistent with our strategic acquisition of MIPT, we intend to continue to supplement the organic growth on our legacy sites by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk adjusted return on investment criteria. Rental and Management Operations Organic Revenue Growth. Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our legacy sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through collocation and lease amendments. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services, the penetration of advanced wireless devices, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital, and general economic conditions. The following key trends within each market that we serve provide opportunities for organic revenue growth: • Domestic. As a result of the rapid subscriber adoption of bandwidth-intensive wireless data applications and advanced wireless devices, wireless service providers in the United States continue to invest in their wireless networks by adding new cell sites as well as additional equipment to their existing cell sites. Growth in wireless data demand has driven wireless providers in the United States to deploy increasing levels of annual wireless capital investment and as a result, we have experienced strong demand for our communications sites. We expect the following key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us: • The deployment of advanced wireless technology across existing wireless networks will provide higher speed data services and enable fixed broadband substitution. As a result, we expect our tenants to continue to deploy additional equipment across their existing networks. • Wireless service providers compete based on the overall capacity and coverage of their existing wireless networks. To maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases, our tenants continue to deploy additional equipment across their existing sites while also adding new cell sites. We anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years, as existing network infrastructure is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage. • Wireless service providers are also investing in reinforcing their networks through incremental backhaul and the utilization of on-site generators, which typically results in additional equipment leased at the tower site, and incremental revenue. • Wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum, and as a result are expected to add additional equipment to their network as they seek to optimize their network configuration. We have entered into holistic master lease agreements with three of our four largest tenants in the United States, which provide for consistent, long-term revenue and a reduction in the likelihood of churn. Typically, these agreements include built-in annual escalators, fixed annual charges which permit our tenants to place a pre-determined amount of equipment on certain of our sites and provisions for incremental lease payments if the equipment levels are exceeded. Our holistic master lease agreements build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced collocation cycle times, thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites. 30 Table of Contents • International. As part of our international expansion initiatives, we have targeted markets in three distinct stages of network development in order to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term. In addition, we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers such as MTN, Telefónica and Vodafone as part of our expansion efforts. We believe that consistent carrier investments in their networks across our international markets position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward. In emerging markets such as India, Ghana and Uganda, wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the United States, and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in underdeveloped areas. In more developed urban locations within these markets, early-stage data network deployments are also underway. Carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while also investing in initial data networks as wireless data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate. In markets with rapidly evolving network technology, such as South Africa and most of the countries in Latin America where we do business, initial voice networks, for the most part, have already been built out, and carriers are focused on third generation (3G) network build outs, with select investments in fourth generation (4G) technology. Recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks. Smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are growing rapidly, which mandates that carriers continue to invest in their networks in order to maintain and augment their quality of service. Finally, in markets with more mature network technology such as Germany and Panama, carriers are focused on deploying 4G data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage. With a more mature customer base, higher smartphone penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage, carrier investment in networks is focused on 4G coverage and capacity. We believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the United States, which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years, will ultimately be replicated in our less advanced international markets. As a result, we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 39,400 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier customers to drive sustainable, long-term growth. Rental and Management Operations New Site Revenue Growth. The results of operations of MIPT have been included in our consolidated results of operations since October 1, 2013, the date of the acquisition. During the period from October 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013, MIPT generated total revenues of $84.1 million and gross margin of $65.0 million. In addition to the approximately 5,370 sites acquired through the acquisition of MIPT, during the year ended December 31, 2013, we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 7,700 sites. In a majority of our international markets, the acquisition or construction of new sites results in increased pass-through revenues (such as ground rent or fuel costs) and expenses. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire larger communications real estate portfolios, both domestically and internationally, to determine whether they meet our risk adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio. New Sites (Acquired or Constructed) 2013 2012 2011 Domestic 5,260 960 470 International(1) 7,810 7,850 10,000 (1) The majority of sites acquired or constructed in 2013 were in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, India, Mexico and South Africa; in 2012 were in Brazil, Germany, India and Uganda; and in 2011 were in Brazil, Colombia, Ghana, India, Mexico and South Africa. 31 Table of Contents Network Development Services Segment Revenue Growth. As we continue to focus on growing our rental and management operations, we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a relatively small percentage of our total revenues. Through our network development services segment, we offer tower-related services, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services, which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites, including in connection with provider network upgrades. Rental and Management Operations Expenses. Direct operating expenses incurred by our domestic and international rental and management segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent, property taxes, repairs and maintenance, security and power and fuel costs, some of which may be passed through to our tenants. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled Selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our domestic and international rental and management segments’ selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow. We may incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on expanding our portfolio. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (“Adjusted EBITDA”), Funds From Operations, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT FFO”), and Adjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO”). We define Adjusted EBITDA as Net income before Income (loss) on discontinued operations, net; Income (loss) on equity method investments; Income tax provision (benefit); Other income (expense); Loss on retirement of long-term obligations; Interest expense; Interest income; Other operating income (expense); Depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense. NAREIT FFO is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges and real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interest. We define AFFO as NAREIT FFO before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) the non-cash portion of our tax provision; (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion; (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges; (vi) other income (expense); (vii) loss on retirement of long-term obligations; (viii) other operating income (expense); and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interest, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO and AFFO are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Neither NAREIT FFO nor AFFO represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO and AFFO are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a 32 Table of Contents key measure used by our management team for purposes of decision making and for evaluating the performance of our operating segments; (2) Adjusted EBITDA is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain debt covenants; (3) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the tower industry to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4) each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (5) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies. Our measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO and AFFO may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO and AFFO to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included below. Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands, except percentages) Revenue Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2013 2012 Rental and management Domestic $ 2,189,365 $ 1,940,689 $ 248,676 13 % International 1,097,725 862,801 234,924 27 Total rental and management 3,287,090 2,803,490 483,600 17 Network development services 74,317 72,470 1,847 3 Total revenues $ 3,361,407 $ 2,875,960 $ 485,447 17 % Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 17% to $3,361.4 million. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in both of our rental and management segments, including organic revenue growth attributable to our legacy sites and revenue growth attributable to the approximately 21,880 new sites that we have constructed or acquired since January 1, 2012. Approximately $84.1 million of the increase was attributable to revenues generated by MIPT. Domestic rental and management segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 13% to $2,189.4 million. This growth was comprised of: • Revenue growth from legacy sites of approximately 7%, which includes approximately 6% due to incremental revenue primarily generated from new tenant leases and amendments to existing tenant leases on our legacy sites and approximately 2% attributable to contractual rent escalations, net of tenant lease cancellations, partially offset by approximately 1% due to a tenant billing settlement and a lease termination settlement during the year ended December 31, 2012, which totaled $15.6 million; • Revenue growth of approximately 4% attributable to the addition of approximately 4,860 domestic sites, as well as managed sites, rooftops and land interests under third-party sites in connection with our acquisition of MIPT; • Revenue growth from new sites (excluding MIPT) of approximately 3%, resulting from the construction or acquisition of approximately 1,360 new sites, as well as land interests under third-party sites since January 1, 2012; and • A decrease of approximately 1% from the impact of straight-line lease accounting. 33 Table of Contents International rental and management segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 27% to $1,097.7 million. This growth was comprised of: • Revenue growth from new sites (excluding MIPT) of approximately 22%, resulting from the construction or acquisition of approximately 15,150 new sites since January 1, 2012; • Revenue growth from legacy sites of approximately 12%, which includes approximately 11% due to incremental revenue primarily generated from new tenant leases and amendments to existing tenant leases on our legacy sites and approximately 2% attributable to contractual rent escalations, net of tenant lease cancellations, partially offset by less than 1% for the reversal of revenue reserves during the year ended December 31, 2012; • Revenue growth of less than 1% attributable to the addition of approximately 510 sites in Costa Rica and Panama in connection with our acquisition of MIPT; and • A decrease of approximately 7% attributable to the negative impact from foreign currency translation, which includes, among others, the negative impact of approximately 3% related to fluctuations in Brazilian Reais (“BRL”), approximately 2% related to fluctuations in South African Rand (“ZAR”) and approximately 2% related to fluctuations in Indian Rupees (“INR”). Network development services segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 3% to $74.3 million. The growth was primarily attributable to an increase in structural engineering services and site acquisition, zoning and permitting services as a result of an increase in tenant lease applications, which are primarily associated with certain tenants’ next generation technology network upgrade projects during the year ended December 31, 2013.

The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our international rental and management segment and other SG&A. Domestic rental and management segment SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 21% to $104.0 million. The increase was primarily driven by increasing personnel costs and professional fees to support our business. International rental and management segment SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 29% to $123.3 million. The increase was primarily due to increases in personnel costs and professional fees to support the growth in our international markets, including Uganda and Germany, which commenced operations in 2012. Network development services segment SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 37% to $9.3 million. The increase was primarily attributable to a reversal of $1.4 million of bad debt expense during the year ended December 31, 2012 upon the receipt of tenant payments for amounts previously reserved, as well as incremental costs to support our business. Other SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 28% to $179.0 million. The increase was primarily due to a $16.4 million increase in SG&A related stock-based compensation expense, which included an incremental $7.8 million due to the timing of recognition of expense associated with awards granted to retirement eligible employees. In addition, other SG&A increased $23.2 million, which included, among other things, an increase of $26.9 million in corporate expenses, partially offset by a $3.7 million non-recurring state tax item recorded during the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in corporate expenses included approximately $14.8 million of legal expenses. 35 Table of Contents Operating Profit Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2013 2012 Rental and management Domestic $ 1,679,957 $ 1,497,471 $ 182,486 12 % International 574,276 453,147 121,129 27 Total rental and management 2,254,233 1,950,618 303,615 16 Network development services 34,496 30,896 3,600 12 % Domestic rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 12% to $1,680.0 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2013, we received a payment from TV Azteca, which included $28.0 million of principal on the notes receivable from TV Azteca, related interest and a prepayment penalty of $4.9 million. In addition, we recorded additional interest income of $2.7 million related to the write-off of a portion of the unamortized discount associated with the original notes receivable. Interest Expense Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2013 2012 Interest expense $ 458,296 $ 401,665 $ 56,631 14 % Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 14% to $458.3 million. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our average debt outstanding of approximately $2.9 billion, which was primarily used to fund our acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in our annualized weighted average cost of borrowing from 5.37% to 4.40%. The weighted average contractual interest rate was 3.84% at December 31, 2013. Loss on Retirement of Long-Term Obligations Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2013 2012 Loss on retirement of long-term obligations $ 38,701 $ 398 $ 38,303 9,624 % During the year ended December 31, 2013, loss on retirement of long-term obligations increased to $38.7 million. We recorded a loss of $35.3 million due to the repayment of the $1.75 billion outstanding balance of the Certificates and incurred prepayment consideration and recorded the acceleration of deferred financing costs. In addition, we recorded a loss of $3.4 million related to the acceleration of the remaining deferred financing costs associated with our $1.0 billion unsecured credit facility entered into in April 2011 (the “2011 Credit Facility”) and the 2012 Term Loan.

The increase was primarily a result of an increase in unrealized foreign currency losses of $177.4 million. During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we recorded unrealized foreign currency losses of approximately $211.7 million and $34.3 million, respectively, resulting primarily from fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates associated with our intercompany notes and similar unaffiliated balances denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The increase in unrealized foreign currency losses is primarily due to the negative impact associated with fluctuations in the Ghanaian Cedi and the Brazilian Reais. Income Tax Provision Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2013 2012 Income tax provision $ 59,541 $ 107,304 $ (47,763 ) (45 )% Effective tax rate 11.0 % 15.3 % 37 Table of Contents The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased 45% to $59.5 million. The effective tax rate (“ETR”) for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased to 11.0% from 15.3%. The ETR during the year ended December 31, 2012 included an increase of 8% due to a valuation allowance recorded on certain previously unreserved deferred tax assets. The ETR during the year ended December 31, 2013 included an increase of 4% due to the restructuring of our domestic TRSs. As a REIT, we may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated in our QRSs. In addition, we are able to offset income in both our TRSs and QRSs by utilizing our NOLs, subject to specified limitations. The ETR on income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT effective as of January 1, 2012 and adjustments for foreign items.

The increase in our operating profit of $307.2 million, as described above, was partially offset by increases in corporate SG&A, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, interest expense and a loss on retirement of long-term obligations recorded during the year ended December 31, 2013. In addition, the increase in our operating profit was partially offset by an increase in other expenses, primarily due to unrealized foreign currency losses. Net income was positively impacted by a decrease in our income tax provision. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 15% to $2,176.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin of $355.8 million, and was partially offset by an increase in SG&A of $71.9 million, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense. 38 Table of Contents Net Income/NAREIT FFO/AFFO Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2013 2012 Net income $ 482,208 $ 594,025 $ (111,817 ) (19 )% Real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion 701,292 562,298 138,994 25 Losses from sale or disposal of real estate and real estate related impairment charges 32,475 23,650 8,825 37 Adjustments for unconsolidated affiliates and noncontrolling interest 41,000 20,238 20,762 103 NAREIT FFO $ 1,256,975 $ 1,200,211 $ 56,764 5 % Straight-line revenue (147,664 ) (165,806 ) (18,142 ) (11 ) Straight-line expense 29,732 33,700 (3,968 ) (12 ) Stock-based compensation expense 68,138 51,983 16,155 31 Non-cash portion of tax provision 7,865 38,027 (30,162 ) (79 ) Non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion 98,853 81,978 16,875 21 Amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges 22,955 21,008 1,947 9 Other expense(1) 207,500 38,300 169,200 442 Loss on retirement of long-term obligations 38,701 398 38,303 9,624 Other operating expenses(2) 39,064 38,535 529 1 Capital improvement capital expenditures (81,218 ) (75,444 ) 5,774 8 Corporate capital expenditures (30,383 ) (20,047 ) 10,336 52 Adjustments for unconsolidated affiliates and noncontrolling interest (41,000 ) (20,238 ) 20,762 103 AFFO $ 1,469,518 $ 1,222,605 $ 246,913 20 % (1) Primarily includes unrealized loss on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

The increase was attributable to an increase in both of our rental and management segments, as well as an increase in our Other SG&A. Domestic rental and management segment SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 11% to $85.7 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the impact of initiatives that we launched during 2011, designed to drive growth and to support a growing portfolio, including increased staffing in field operations, sales and finance and other functions supporting the expansion of our business. International rental and management segment SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 16% to $95.6 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the launch of operations in our new markets as well as our continued investments in international expansion initiatives in foreign operations, partially offset by the reversal of approximately $3.8 million of bad debt expense in Mexico for amounts previously reserved. Network development services segment SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased 14% to $6.7 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to the reversal of bad debt expense upon the receipt of a customer payment for amounts previously reserved, partially offset by higher personnel related costs. Other SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 14% to $139.3 million. The increase was primarily due to a $12.4 million increase in corporate expenses and a $5.1 million increase in SG&A related stock-based compensation expense. The increase in corporate expenses was primarily attributable to incremental employee costs of approximately $8.7 million associated with supporting a growing global organization and a $3.7 million non-recurring state tax expense.

International rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 34% to $453.1 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our international rental and management segment gross margin (31%) as described above, and was partially offset by increases in our international rental and management segment SG&A (16%), as described above. Network development services segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 54% to $30.9 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in network development services segment gross margin and the decrease in SG&A, as described above. 42 Table of Contents Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2012 2011 Depreciation, amortization and accretion $ 644,276 $ 555,517 $ 88,759 16 % Depreciation, amortization and accretion for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 16% to $644.3 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the depreciation, amortization and accretion associated with the acquisition or construction of approximately 19,280 sites since January 1, 2011, which resulted in an increase in property and equipment.

This change was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately $17.0 million in impairment charges and loss on disposal of assets, which included an impairment charge of $10.8 million of one of our outdoor DAS networks, upon the termination of a tenant lease during the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately $12.9 million in acquisition related costs and non-recurring consulting and legal costs incurred in 2011 associated with our conversion to a REIT. Interest Expense Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2012 2011 Interest expense $ 401,665 $ 311,854 $ 89,811 29 % Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 29% to $401.7 million. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our average debt outstanding of approximately $1.6 billion, which was primarily used to fund our recent acquisitions, and an increase in our annualized weighted average cost of borrowing from 5.32% to 5.37%. Other Expense Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2012 2011 Other expense $ 38,300 $ 122,975 $ (84,675 ) (69 )% Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased 69% to $38.3 million. The decrease was primarily a result of a decline in unrealized currency losses of $96.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recorded unrealized foreign currency losses of approximately $34.3 million resulting primarily from fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates associated with our intercompany notes and similar unaffiliated balances denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies and other expenses of approximately $4.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded unrealized foreign currency losses of approximately $131.1 million and other miscellaneous income of $8.1 million. 43 Table of Contents Income Tax Provision Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2012 2011 Income tax provision $ 107,304 $ 125,080 $ (17,776 ) (14 )% Effective tax rate 15.3 % 24.7 % The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased 14% to $107.3 million. The ETR for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased to 15.3% from 24.7%. This decrease was primarily attributable to our dividend paid deduction and decreased state taxes during the year ended December 31, 2012, partially offset by an increase in foreign taxes and valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. The deferred tax assets arose primarily as a result of purchase accounting and existing NOLs, which were generated partly from interest on intercompany debt. The ETR on income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT effective as of January 1, 2012 and to adjustments for foreign items.

The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our rental and management segments operating profit, as described above, as well as decreases in unrealized foreign currency losses and income tax provision, partially offset by increases in depreciation, amortization and accretion and interest expense. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased 19% to $1,892.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our rental and management segments gross margin, and was partially offset by an increase in SG&A. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview During the year ended December 31, 2013, we raised capital, thereby increasing our financial flexibility and our ability to return value to our stockholders. Our significant 2013 financing transactions included: • The completion of the Securitization involving assets related to the Secured Towers, which are owned by two of our special purpose subsidiaries, through a private offering of $1.8 billion of the Securities. We used the net proceeds from the Securitization to repay the $1.75 billion of the Certificates. 44 Table of Contents • The completion of a registered public offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.40% Notes and $500 million aggregate principal amount of the 5.00% Notes. We used a portion of the net proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under the 2013 Credit Facility. • The completion of a registered public offering of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 3.50% Notes. We used the net proceeds to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the 2011 Credit Facility and a portion of the outstanding indebtedness incurred under our $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility entered into in January 2012 (the “2012 Credit Facility”). • The refinancing of our credit facilities, including the termination of the 2011 Credit Facility upon entering into the 2013 Credit Facility and the repayment and termination of the 2012 Term Loan upon the entering into the 2013 Term Loan. We also increased our borrowing capacity by entering into the Short-Term Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately $2.3 billion of total liquidity. In January 2014, we repaid $88.0 million under the 2012 Credit Facility and $710.0 million under the 2013 Credit Facility with proceeds from the issuance of $250 million aggregate principal amount of reopened 3.40% Notes and $500 million aggregate principal amount of reopened 5.00% Notes and cash on hand. As a result, our liquidity increased by $798.0 million in January 2014. Summary cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 is set forth below (in thousands): 2013 2012 2011 Net cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 1,599,047 $ 1,414,391 $ 1,165,942 Investing activities (5,173,337 ) (2,558,385 ) (2,790,812 ) Financing activities 3,525,565 1,170,366 1,086,095 Net effect of changes in exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (26,317 ) 12,055 (14,997 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (75,042 ) $ 38,427 $ (553,772 ) We use our cash flows to fund our operations and investments in our business, including tower maintenance and improvements, communications site construction and managed network installations, and tower and land acquisitions, such as our acquisition of MIPT. Additionally, we use our cash flows to make distributions of our REIT taxable income in order to maintain our REIT qualification under the Code and fund our stock repurchase program. We fund our international expansion efforts primarily through a combination of cash on hand, intercompany debt and equity contributions. As of December 31, 2013, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $14.5 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and debt service obligations, as well as our required REIT distributions. We believe the cash generated by operations during the year ending December 31, 2014 will be sufficient to fund our REIT distribution requirements, capital expenditures and our debt service (interest and principal repayments) obligations for 2014. If our pending acquisitions, capital expenditures or debt repayments exceed the cash generated by our operations, we believe we have sufficient borrowing capacity under our credit facilities to fund our activities. As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately $211.3 million of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $61.7 million was held by our joint ventures. Historically, it has not been our practice to repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs. However, in the event that we do repatriate any funds, we may be required to accrue and pay taxes. 45 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2013, cash provided by operating activities was $1,599.0 million, an increase of $184.7 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the operating profit of our rental and management segments as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, partially offset by increases in Other SG&A and cash paid for interest and a decrease in cash provided by working capital. Working capital was positively impacted by the receipt of capital contributions from tenants and partially offset by an increase in prepaid assets. For the year ended December 31, 2012, cash provided by operating activities was $1,414.4 million, an increase of $248.4 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the operating profit of our rental and management segments and an increase in cash provided by working capital. This increase was partially offset by an increase in cash paid for interest and income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2012. Cash Flows from Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2013, cash used for investing activities was $5,173.3 million, an increase of approximately $2,615.0 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Our significant investing transactions in 2013 included the following: • We spent $724.5 million for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities, including (i) $381.6 million of capital expenditures for discretionary capital projects, such as completion of the construction of approximately 2,370 communications sites and the installation of approximately 1,310 shared generators domestically, (ii) $83.8 million spent to acquire land under our towers that was subject to ground agreements (including leases), (iii) $111.6 million of capital expenditures related to capital improvements primarily attributable to our communications sites and corporate capital expenditures primarily attributable to information technology improvements, (iv) $120.8 million for the redevelopment of existing communications sites to accommodate new tenant equipment and (v) $26.7 million of capital expenditures related to start-up capital projects primarily attributable to acquisitions and new market launches and costs that are contemplated in the business cases for these investments. • We completed the acquisition of MIPT for an estimated purchase price of approximately $4.9 billion, funded by cash payments of $3.3 billion and the assumption of approximately $1.5 billion of existing MIPT debt. In addition, we spent $1.2 billion to acquire approximately 5,330 communications sites in our legacy markets, primarily in Mexico and Brazil. For the year ended December 31, 2012, cash used for investing activities was $2,558.4 million, a decrease of approximately $232.4 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.

We plan to continue to allocate our available capital after our REIT distribution requirements among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria. Accordingly, we expect to continue to deploy our capital through our annual capital expenditure program, including land purchases and new site construction, and through acquisitions. We expect that our 2014 total capital expenditures will be between approximately $850 million and $950 million, including: (i) between $120 million and $130 million for capital improvements, which includes spending related to a lighting and monitoring system upgrade in the United States of approximately $15 million, and corporate capital expenditures, (ii) between $40 million and $50 million for start-up capital projects, (iii) between $170 and $180 million for the redevelopment of existing communications sites, (iv) between $105 million and $115 million for ground lease purchases and (v) between $415 million and $475 million for other discretionary capital projects including the construction of approximately 2,250 to 2,750 new communications sites.

Our significant financing transactions in 2012 included the increase of our borrowing capacity by entering into the 2012 Credit Facility and the 2012 Term Loan; the completion of a registered public offering of $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.70% senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the “4.70% Notes”); the repurchase of 872,005 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $62.7 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to our stock repurchase program; and the payment of an aggregate of $355.6 million in distributions to our stockholders of record. In addition to the transactions noted above, our financing activities included borrowings and repayments under our credit facilities and other long-term borrowings. Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-1A and Series 2013-2A. On March 15, 2013, we completed the Securitization involving assets related to the Secured Towers owned by two of our special purpose subsidiaries, through a private offering of $1.8 billion of the Securities. The net proceeds of the transaction were $1.78 billion. The Securities were issued by American Tower Trust I (the “Trust”), a trust established by American Tower Depositor Sub, LLC (the “Depositor”), our indirect wholly owned special purpose subsidiary. The assets of the Trust consist of a nonrecourse loan (the “Loan”) to American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (the “Borrowers”), pursuant to a First Amended and Restated Loan 47 Table of Contents and Security Agreement dated as of March 15, 2013 (the “Loan Agreement”). The Borrowers are special purpose entities formed solely for the purpose of holding the Secured Towers subject to a securitization. The Securities were issued in two separate series of the same class pursuant to a First Amended and Restated Trust and Servicing Agreement (the “Trust Agreement”), with terms identical to the Loan. The Series 2013-1A Securities have an expected life of five years with a final repayment date in March 2043 and an interest rate of 1.551%. The Series 2013-2A Securities have an expected life of ten years with a final repayment date in March 2048 and an interest rate of 3.070%. The effective weighted average life and interest rate of the Securities was 8.6 years and 2.648%, respectively, as of the date of issuance. The Borrowers may prepay the Loan in whole or in part at any time, provided it is accompanied by applicable prepayment consideration. If the prepayment occurs within twelve months of the anticipated repayment date for the Series 2013-1A Securities or eighteen months of the anticipated repayment date for the Series 2013-2A Securities, no prepayment consideration is due. The entire unpaid principal balance of the component of the Loan related to the Series 2013-1A Securities and the Series 2013-2A Securities will be due in March 2043 and March 2048, respectively. The Loan may be defeased in whole at any time prior to the anticipated repayment date for any component of the Loan then outstanding. The Loan is secured by (1) mortgages, deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the Secured Towers, (2) a pledge of the Borrowers’ operating cash flows from the Secured Towers, (3) a security interest in substantially all of the Borrowers’ personal property and fixtures and (4) the Borrowers’ rights under the tenant leases and the management agreement entered into in connection with the Securitization. American Tower Holding Sub, LLC, whose only material assets are its equity interests in each of the Borrowers, and American Tower Guarantor Sub, LLC, whose only material asset is its equity interest in American Tower Holding Sub, LLC, each have guaranteed repayment of the Loan and pledged their equity interests in their respective subsidiary or subsidiaries as security for such payment obligations. American Tower Guarantor Sub, LLC, American Tower Holding Sub, LLC, the Depositor and the Borrowers each were formed as special purpose entities solely for purposes of entering a securitization transaction, and the assets and credit of these entities are not available to satisfy the debts and other obligations of us or any other person, except as set forth in the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement includes operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the Borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the Loan Agreement). The organizational documents of the Borrowers contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities, including the requirement that the Borrowers maintain at least two independent directors. The Loan Agreement also contains certain covenants that require the Borrowers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets, promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the Loan Agreement and other agreements related to the Secured Towers, and allow the trustee reasonable access to the Secured Towers, including the right to conduct site investigations. A failure to comply with the covenants in the Loan Agreement could prevent the Borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the Secured Towers, and could prevent the Borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of the Secured Towers to us. If the Borrowers were to default on the Loan, the servicer could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the Secured Towers, in which case we could lose the Secured Towers and the revenue associated with those assets. Under the Loan Agreement, the Borrowers are required to maintain reserve accounts, including for ground rents, real estate and personal property taxes and insurance premiums, and to reserve a portion of advance rents from tenants on the Secured Towers. Based on the terms of the Loan Agreement, all rental cash receipts received for each month are reserved for the succeeding month and held in an account controlled by the trustee and then 48 Table of Contents released. The $103.2 million held in the reserve accounts as of December 31, 2013 was classified as Restricted cash on our accompanying consolidated balance sheet. GTP Notes. In connection with our acquisition of MIPT, we assumed approximately $1.49 billion principal amount of existing indebtedness under the GTP Notes. The Series 2010-1 notes were issued by GTP Towers Issuer, LLC (“GTP Towers”), the Series 2011-1 notes, Series 2011-2 notes and Series 2013-1 notes were issued by GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC (“GTP Partners”) and the Series 2012-1 notes and Series 2012-2 notes were issued by GTP Cellular Sites, LLC (“GTP Cellular Sites,” and together with GTP Towers and GTP Partners, the “GTP Issuers”). The following table sets forth certain terms of the GTP Notes.

The GTP Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time beginning two years after the date of issuance, provided such payment is accompanied by applicable prepayment consideration. If the prepayment occurs within six months of the anticipated repayment date, with respect to the Series 2010-1 notes, or one year of the anticipated repayment date with respect to the other GTP Notes, no prepayment consideration is due. As of December 31, 2013, the GTP Notes were secured by, among other things, an aggregate of 3,893 sites and 1,717 property interests owned by subsidiaries of the GTP Issuers and other related assets (the “GTP Secured Towers”). Amounts due under the GTP Notes will be paid from the cash flows generated by the GTP Secured Towers that secure the applicable series of GTP Notes. These funds in turn will be used to service the payment of interest on the applicable series of GTP Notes and for any other payments required by the indentures governing the GTP Notes (the “GTP Indentures”). The GTP Indentures include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for note offerings subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the GTP Issuers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary exceptions for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the GTP Indentures). The GTP Indentures also contain certain covenants that require the GTP Issuers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports, operating budgets and budgets for capital improvements not included in annual financial statements in accordance with GAAP, promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the GTP Indentures and other agreements related to the GTP Secured Towers, and allow the trustee reasonable access to the GTP Secured Towers, including the right to conduct site investigations. 49 Table of Contents A failure to comply with the covenants in the GTP Indentures could prevent the GTP Issuers from taking certain actions with respect to the GTP Secured Towers and could prevent the GTP Issuers from distributing excess cash flow to us. In addition, upon occurrence and during an event of default, the trustee may, in its discretion or at direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of GTP Notes, declare such series of GTP Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such GTP Notes. Furthermore, if the GTP Issuers were to default on a series of the GTP Notes, the trustee may demand, collect, take possession of, receive, settle, compromise, adjust, sue for, foreclose or realize upon all or any portion of the GTP Secured Towers securing such series, in which case we could lose the GTP Secured Towers and the revenue associated with those assets. Under the GTP Indentures, the GTP Issuers are required to maintain reserve accounts, including for amounts received or due from tenants related to future periods, property taxes, insurance, ground rents, certain expenses and debt service. The $26.8 million held in the reserve accounts as of December 31, 2013 was classified as Restricted cash on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Costa Rica Loan. In connection with our acquisition of MIPT, we assumed $32.6 million of secured debt in Costa Rica (the “Costa Rica Loan”). The Costa Rica Loan would have matured on February 16, 2019 and bore interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 5.50%. On February 12, 2014, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the Costa Rica Loan. Colombian Bridge Loans. In connection with the acquisition of communications sites in Colombia, one of our Colombian subsidiaries entered into five Colombian Peso (“COP”) denominated bridge loans for an aggregate principal amount outstanding of 94.0 billion COP (approximately $48.8 million), and on August 6, 2013, entered into an additional 14.0 billion COP bridge loan (approximately $7.3 million). As of December 31, 2013, the bridge loans had an aggregate principal amount outstanding of 108.0 billion COP (approximately $56.1 million), mature on April 22, 2014 and have an interest rate of 7.94%. Mexican Loan. On November 1, 2013, in connection with the acquisition of towers in Mexico from NII, one of our Mexican subsidiaries entered into the Mexican Loan. On November 5, 2013, our Mexican subsidiary borrowed approximately 4.9 billion MXN (approximately $374.7 million). Our Mexican subsidiary maintains the ability to draw down the remaining 0.3 billion MXN under the Mexican Loan until February 28, 2014. The Mexican Loan matures on May 1, 2015 and bears interest at a margin over the Equilibrium Interbank Interest Rate (“TIIE”). The interest rate will range between 0.25% and 1.50% above TIIE, pursuant to a schedule set forth in the credit agreement. As of December 31, 2013, 4.9 billion MXN (approximately $377.5 million) was outstanding under the Mexican Loan and the margin over TIIE was 0.25%. South African Facility. In connection with our expansion initiatives in South Africa, one of our subsidiaries entered into a 1.2 billion ZAR denominated credit facility (the “South African Facility”) in November 2011. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the subsidiary borrowed an additional 116.3 million ZAR (approximately $12.0 million) and repaid 23.8 million ZAR (approximately $2.5 million). On September 30, 2013, the subsidiary’s ability to draw on the South African Facility expired. As of December 31, 2013, 926.9 million ZAR (approximately $88.3 million) was outstanding under the South African Facility. Indian Working Capital Facility. On April 29, 2013, one of our Indian subsidiaries (“ATC India”) entered into a working capital facility agreement (the “Indian Working Capital Facility”), which allows ATC India to borrow an amount not to exceed the INR equivalent of $10.0 million. Any advances made pursuant to the Indian Working Capital Facility will be payable on the earlier of demand or six months following the borrowing date and the interest rate will be determined at the time of advance by the bank. As of December 31, 2013, ATC India had no amounts outstanding under the Indian Working Capital Facility. ATC India maintains the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the Indian Working Capital Facility in the ordinary course. 50 Table of Contents 2011 Credit Facility. On June 28, 2013, we terminated the 2011 Credit Facility upon entering into the 2013 Credit Facility at our option without penalty or premium. The 2011 Credit Facility was undrawn at the time of termination. The 2011 Credit Facility had a term of five years and would have matured on April 8, 2016. 2012 Credit Facility. On September 26, 2013, we borrowed $963.0 million under the 2012 Credit Facility to partially fund our acquisition of MIPT. On October 29, 2013, we repaid $800.0 million with net proceeds from the 2013 Term Loan and cash on hand. On December 30, 2013, we repaid an additional $75.0 million. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2013, we had $88.0 million outstanding under the 2012 Credit Facility and had approximately $7.5 million of undrawn letters of credit. In January 2014, we repaid all amounts outstanding with proceeds from the offering of reopened 3.40% Notes and reopened 5.00% Notes. We maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under our 2012 Credit Facility in the ordinary course. The 2012 Credit Facility has a term of five years and matures on January 31, 2017. The current margin over LIBOR that we incur on borrowings is 1.625%, and the current commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the 2012 Credit Facility is 0.225%. On September 20, 2013, we entered into an amendment agreement with respect to the 2012 Credit Facility, which (i) amended the definition of “Total Debt” to be net of unrestricted domestic cash and cash equivalents and (ii) increased the permitted ratio of Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (as defined therein) from 6.00 to 1.00 to 6.50 to 1.00 from September 30, 2013 to September 30, 2014. On December 10, 2013, we entered into a second amendment agreement with respect to the 2012 Credit Facility. The second amendment (i) increased the limitation on indebtedness of, and guaranteed by, our subsidiaries from $600 million in the aggregate to $800 million in the aggregate, (ii) added a representation and warranty and a covenant regarding our and our subsidiaries’ compliance with sanctions laws and regulations, (iii) provided that compliance with the interest expense ratio is only required in the event that our debt ratings are below investment grade and (iv) increased the threshold for certain defaults with respect to judgments, attachments or acceleration of indebtedness from $200 million to $250 million. 2013 Credit Facility. On June 28, 2013, we entered into the 2013 Credit Facility, which initially allowed us to borrow up to $1.5 billion, and includes a $1.0 billion sublimit for multicurrency borrowings, a $200.0 million sublimit for letters of credit, a $50.0 million sublimit for swingline loans and an expansion option allowing us to request additional commitments of up to $500.0 million, which we exercised on September 20, 2013. As a result, we may borrow up to $2.0 billion under the 2013 Credit Facility. The 2013 Credit Facility has a term of five years, matures on June 28, 2018 and includes two one-year renewal periods at our option. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at final maturity. The 2013 Credit Facility does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. We have the option of choosing either a defined base rate or LIBOR as the applicable base rate for borrowings under the 2013 Credit Facility. The interest rate ranges between 1.125% to 2.000% above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or between 0.125% to 1.000% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based upon our debt ratings. A quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the 2013 Credit Facility is required, ranging from 0.125% to 0.400% per annum, based upon our debt ratings. The current margin over LIBOR that we incur on borrowings is 1.250% and the current commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the new credit facility is 0.150%. The loan agreement contains certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply. Any failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreement would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds, but would constitute a default, which could result in, 51 Table of Contents among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. On September 20, 2013, we entered into an amendment agreement with respect to the 2013 Credit Facility, which (i) amended the definition of “Total Debt” to be net of unrestricted domestic cash and cash equivalents, (ii) increased the permitted ratio of Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (as defined therein) from 6.00 to 1.00 to 6.50 to 1.00 from September 30, 2013 to September 30, 2014 and (iii) added an additional expansion feature permitting us to request an additional increase of the commitments under the 2013 Credit Facility from time to time up to an aggregate additional $750.0 million, including in the form of a term loan, from any of the lenders or other eligible lenders that elect to make such increases available, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. On September 26, 2013, we borrowed $1,853.0 million under the 2013 Credit Facility to partially fund our acquisition of MIPT. As of December 31, 2013, we had $1,853.0 million outstanding under the 2013 Credit Facility and had approximately $2.8 million of undrawn letters of credit. In January 2014, we used proceeds from the offering of reopened 3.40% Notes and reopened 5.00% Notes, together with cash on hand, to repay $710.0 million of existing indebtedness and, as a result, we have $1,143.0 million outstanding under the 2013 Credit Facility. We maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the 2013 Credit Facility in the ordinary course. Short-Term Credit Facility. On September 20, 2013, we entered into the Short-Term Credit Facility. The Short-Term Credit Facility does not require amortization of payments and may be repaid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. The unutilized portion of the commitments under the Short-Term Credit Facility may be irrevocably reduced or terminated by us in whole or in part without penalty. The Short-Term Credit Facility matures on September 19, 2014. Amounts borrowed under the Short-Term Credit Facility will bear interest, at our option, at a margin above LIBOR or the defined base rate. For LIBOR based borrowings, interest rates will range from 1.125% to 2.000% above LIBOR. For base rate borrowings, interest rates will range from 0.125% to 1.000% above the defined base rate. In each case, the applicable margin is based upon our debt ratings. In addition, the loan agreement provides for a quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the Short-Term Credit Facility ranging from 0.125% to 0.400% per annum, based upon our debt ratings. The current margin over LIBOR that we would incur (should we choose LIBOR) on borrowings is 1.250% and the current commitment fee on the undrawn portion is 0.150%. The loan agreement contains certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply. Any failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds, but would constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. As of December 31, 2013, we had no amounts outstanding under the Short-Term Credit Facility. We maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the Short-Term Credit Facility in the ordinary course. 2012 Term Loan. On October 29, 2013, we repaid the 2012 Term Loan without penalty or premium upon entering into the 2013 Term Loan. The 2012 Term Loan had a term of five years and would have matured on June 29, 2017. On September 20, 2013, we entered into an amendment agreement with respect to the 2012 Term Loan, which (i) amended the definition of “Total Debt” to be net of unrestricted domestic cash and cash equivalents and (ii) increased the permitted ratio of Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (as defined therein) from 6.00 to 1.00 to 6.50 to 1.00. 2013 Term Loan. On October 29, 2013, we entered into the $1.5 billion 2013 Term Loan, and together with cash on hand, repaid all amounts outstanding under the 2012 Term Loan and $800.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under the 2012 Credit Facility. 52 Table of Contents The 2013 Term Loan includes an expansion option allowing us to request additional commitments of up to $500 million. The 2013 Term Loan matures on January 3, 2019. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The 2013 Term Loan may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. We have the option of choosing either a defined base rate or LIBOR as the applicable base rate. The interest rate ranges between 1.125% to 2.250% above LIBOR or between 0.125% to 1.250% above the defined base rate, in each case based upon our debt ratings. The current margin over LIBOR is 1.25%. The loan agreement contains certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply. Any failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreement would constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. Senior Notes Offerings. On January 8, 2013, we completed a registered public offering of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 3.50% Notes. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $983.4 million, after deducting commissions and expenses. We used $265.0 million of the net proceeds to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the 2011 Credit Facility and $718.4 million to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness incurred under the 2012 Credit Facility. The 3.50% Notes mature on January 31, 2023, and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 31 and July 31 of each year, commencing on July 31, 2013. Interest on the notes began to accrue on January 8, 2013 and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. On August 19, 2013, we completed a registered public offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.40% Notes and $500 million aggregate principal amount of the 5.00% Notes. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $1,238.7 million, after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. We used a portion of the proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness under the 2013 Credit Facility. On January 10, 2014, we completed a registered public offering of $250.0 million principal amount of reopened 3.40% Notes and $500.0 million principal amount of reopened 5.00% Notes. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $763.8 million, after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. We used a portion of the proceeds, together with cash on hand, to repay $88.0 million of indebtedness under the 2012 Credit Facility and $710.0 million of indebtedness under the 2013 Credit Facility. As of January 10, 2014, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of each of the 3.40% Notes and 5.00% Notes was $1.0 billion. The 3.40% Notes mature on February 15, 2019 and the 5.00% Notes mature on February 15, 2024. Accrued and unpaid interest on the 3.40% Notes and the 5.00% Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2014. Interest on the 3.40% Notes and the 5.00% Notes began to accrue from August 19, 2013 and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. We may redeem the 3.50% Notes, the 3.40% Notes or the 5.00% Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such notes, plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date. If we undergo a change of control and ratings decline, each as defined in the supplemental indenture governing such notes, we may be required to repurchase all of the 3.50% Notes, the 3.40% Notes or the 5.00% Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if any), up to but not including the repurchase date. 53 Table of Contents The 3.50% Notes, the 3.40% Notes and the 5.00% Notes rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries. The supplemental indenture contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and our (together with our subsidiaries’) ability to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that we, and our subsidiaries, may incur certain liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness, if the aggregate amount of such liens does not exceed 3.5x Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the supplemental indenture. Stock Repurchase Program. In March 2011, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to purchase up to $1.5 billion of common stock (the “2011 Buyback”). During the year ended December 31, 2013, we repurchased 1,938,021 shares of our common stock for an aggregate of $145.0 million, including commissions and fees, pursuant to the 2011 Buyback. On September 6, 2013, we temporarily suspended repurchases following the signing of our agreement to acquire MIPT. As of December 31, 2013, we had repurchased a total of approximately 6.3 million shares of our common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $389.0 million, including commissions and fees. Under the 2011 Buyback, we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at prevailing prices in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements, and subject to market conditions and other factors. To facilitate repurchases, we make purchases pursuant to trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. We continue to manage the pacing of the remaining $1.1 billion under the 2011 Buyback in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors, including our financial policies. We expect to fund any further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Purchases under the 2011 Buyback are subject to us having available cash to fund repurchases. Sales of Equity Securities. We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plans. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we received an aggregate of $45.5 million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and from our employee stock purchase plan. Distributions. As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income so as to not be subject to income tax or excise tax on undistributed REIT taxable income. The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions, however, will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will be declared based upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain REIT status and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we declared an aggregate of $434.5 million in regular cash distributions to our stockholders, which included our fourth quarter distribution of approximately $114.5 million on December 31, 2013 to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 16, 2013. For more details on the regular cash distributions paid to our stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2013, see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. 54 Table of Contents We accrue distributions on unvested restricted stock unit awards granted subsequent to January 1, 2012, which are payable upon vesting. As of December 31, 2013, we accrued $1.9 million of distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we paid $0.2 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units. Contractual Obligations.

(4) Assumed by us in connection with the Unison Acquisition, and have anticipated repayment dates of April 15, 2017, April 15, 2020 and April 15, 2020, respectively, and a final maturity date of April 15, 2040. (5) Denominated in COP. The maturity dates for the Colombian bridge loans may be extended from time to time. (6) Denominated in U.S. Dollars.

(12) Operating lease payments include payments to be made under non-cancellable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option, which we expect to renew because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases. (13) Primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other non-current liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily our straight-line rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash. (14) Other non-current liabilities exclude $30.5 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and $30.9 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled. Settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe. However, based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements, we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Interest Rate Swap Agreements. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to variability in interest rates on debt in Colombia, Costa Rica and South Africa. All of our interest rate swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges and have an aggregate notional amount of $139.3 million, interest rates ranging from 1.62% to 7.83% and expiration dates through November 2020. On February 12, 2014, we repaid the Costa Rica Loan and subsequently terminated the associated interest rate swap agreements. Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Internally Generated Funds. Because the majority of our tenant leases are multi-year contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management operations as of the end of 2013 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to 56 Table of Contents generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites. Restrictions Under Loan Agreements Relating to Our Credit Facilities. The loan agreements for the 2012 Credit Facility, the 2013 Credit Facility, the Short-Term Credit Facility and the 2013 Term Loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreements also contain covenants that establish three financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage, senior secured leverage and interest coverage, as set forth below. As of December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (each as defined in the loan agreements) of 6.50 to 1.00 through September 30, 2014, and of 6.00 to 1.00 thereafter. Based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, we could incur approximately $1.2 billion of additional indebtedness and still remain in compliance with this ratio. In addition, if we maintain our existing debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $185 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of Senior Secured Debt (as defined in the loan agreements) to Adjusted EBITDA of 3.00 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, we could incur approximately $3.4 billion of additional Senior Secured Debt and still remain in compliance with the current ratio (effectively, however, this ratio would be limited to $1.2 billion to remain in compliance with other covenants). In addition, if we maintain our existing Senior Secured Debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $1.1 billion and we would still remain in compliance with the current ratio. Interest Coverage Ratio: In the event our debt ratings fall below investment grade, we will be required to maintain a ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense (as defined in the loan agreements) of not less than 2.50 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, our interest expense, which was $447 million for that period, could increase by approximately $500 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. In addition, if our interest expense does not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $1.2 billion and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. The loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants. Any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but would constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next twelve months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. Restrictions Under Agreements Relating to the Securitization and the GTP Notes. The Loan Agreement related to the Securitization and the GTP Indentures include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and 57 Table of Contents other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, the Borrowers and GTP Issuers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the Loan Agreement and GTP Indentures). Under the terms of the agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the Loan or the GTP Notes (as applicable), which must be deposited, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of the assets securing the Loan or the GTP Notes are released to the Borrowers or the applicable GTP Issuer, which can then be distributed to, and used by, us. Since the inception of the Loan in March 2013 through December 31, 2013, the Borrowers have distributed excess cash to us of approximately $496.1 million. Since our assumption of the GTP Notes on October 1, 2013, through December 31, 2013, the GTP Issuers have distributed excess cash to us of approximately $48.8 million. In order to distribute this excess cash flow to us, the Borrowers and the GTP Issuers must maintain a specified debt service coverage ratio (“DSCR”), calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the Loan Agreement or the applicable GTP Indenture) to the amount of interest required to be paid over the succeeding twelve months on the principal amount of the Loan or the principal amount of the GTP Notes that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination, plus the amount of the payable trustee and servicing fees. If the DSCR with respect to the Securities or any series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Towers or GTP Partners is equal to or below 1.30x (the “Cash Trap DSCR”) at the end of any calendar quarter and it continues for two consecutive calendar quarters, or if the DSCR with respect to any series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Cellular Sites is equal to or below the Cash Trap DSCR at the end of any calendar month and it continues for two consecutive calendar months, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required with respect to the particular series of Securities or GTP Notes under the Loan Agreement or GTP Indentures, as applicable, will be deposited into reserve accounts instead of being released to the Borrowers or the GTP Issuers. The funds in the reserve accounts will not be released to the Borrowers, GTP Towers or GTP Partners for distribution to us unless the DSCR with respect to such series of Securities or GTP Notes exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. Likewise, the funds in the reserve account will not be released to GTP Cellular Sites for distribution to us unless the DSCR with respect to such series of GTP Notes exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar months. Additionally, an “amortization period,” commences as of the end of any calendar quarter with respect to the Securities and the series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Towers and GTP Partners, and as of the end of any calendar month with respect to the series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Cellular Sites, if the DSCR of such series equals or falls below 1.15x (the “Minimum DSCR”). The “amortization period” will continue to exist until the end of any calendar quarter with respect to the Securities and the series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Towers and GTP Partners for which the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. Similarly, the “amortization period” will continue to exist until the end of any calendar month with respect to the series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Cellular Sites, for which the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar months. If on the anticipated repayment date, the outstanding principal amount with respect to any series of the GTP Notes or the component of the Loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of the Securities has not been paid in full, an “amortization period” will continue until such principal amount of the applicable series of GTP Notes or the component of the Loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of Securities is repaid in full. During an amortization period, all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve accounts because the Cash Trap DSCR was not met would be applied to pay principal of the applicable subclass of Securities or series of GTP Notes on each monthly payment date, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Further, 58 Table of Contents additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any subclass of the Securities or series of GTP Notes from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the Loan Agreement or Indentures, as applicable. Consequently, a failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent the Borrowers or GTP Issuers from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions, meet REIT distribution requirements and fund our stock repurchase program. If the Borrowers were to default on the Loan, the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the Secured Towers, in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers. In addition, upon occurrence and during an event of default, the trustee may, in its discretion or at direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of GTP Notes, declare such series of GTP Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such GTP Notes. Furthermore, if the GTP Issuers were to default on a series of the GTP Notes, the trustee may demand, collect, take possession of, receive, settle, compromise, adjust, sue for, foreclose or realize upon all or any portion of the GTP Secured Towers securing such series, in which case we could lose the GTP Secured Towers and the revenue associated with those assets. As of December 31, 2013, the Borrowers’ DSCR was 9.34x. Based on the Borrowers’ net cash flow for the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2013 and the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the Loan, the Borrowers could endure a reduction of approximately $383 million in net cash flow before triggering the Cash Trap DSCR, and approximately $390 million in net cash flow before triggering the Minimum DSCR. As of December 31, 2013, the DSCR of GTP Towers, GTP Partners and GTP Cellular Sites were 3.53x, 2.84x and 2.48x, respectively. Based on the net cash flow of GTP Towers, GTP Partners and GTP Cellular Sites for the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2013 and the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the applicable series of GTP Notes, GTP Towers, GTP Partners and GTP Cellular Sites could endure a reduction of approximately $29.0 million, $66.8 million and $15.7 million, respectively, in net cash flow before triggering the Cash Trap DSCR, and approximately $31.0 million, $73.3 million and $17.7 million, respectively, in net cash flow before triggering the Minimum DSCR. As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness. In addition, in order to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and fund our stock repurchase program, we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities. If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements, refinance our existing indebtedness or fund our stock repurchase program. In addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and, consequently, a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to impairment of assets, asset retirement 59 Table of Contents obligations, accounting for acquisitions, revenue recognition, rent expense, stock-based compensation and income taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2013. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. • Impairment of Assets—Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization: We review long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable. We review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows under this approach is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. If the carrying value were to exceed the undiscounted cash flows, measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment. We monitor our customer-related intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts, or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of the customer-related intangible assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows. If we determine that the carrying value of the customer-related intangible asset may not be recoverable, we measure any impairment based on the fair value of the asset as determined by the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset, as compared to the asset’s carrying value. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment. • Impairment of Assets—Goodwill: We review goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is recorded in our domestic and international rental and management segments and network development services segment. We utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment and we employ a discounted cash flow analysis. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. Under the first step of this test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying value of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we conduct the second step of this test, in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. 60 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2013, no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test. The fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying value and passed with a substantial margin; except for one reporting unit, whose fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately $14.3 million. For this reporting unit, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that none of (i) a 2% reduction in projected revenues, (ii) a 60 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital or (iii) a 20% reduction in terminal sales growth rate, individually, which we determined to be reasonable, would impact our conclusions. The goodwill recorded in this reporting unit approximated $15.4 million as of December 31, 2013, and is the result of recently completed acquisitions. Accordingly, the sensitivity of projections to changes in the various assumptions is due, in part, to the timing of the underlying acquisition, current levels of cash flows and amounts of cash flows generated in excess of the planned amounts. Due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the measurement date, the fair value of intangible assets and goodwill used to test for impairment is in line with the fair value used to initially measure the business. • Asset Retirement Obligations: We recognize the fair value of obligations to remove our tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of our tower assets are located. The associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. We updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net decrease in the estimated obligation of $10.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2013. The change in 2013 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion in the consolidated statements of operations. The significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary. • Acquisitions: For those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, we allocate the purchase price, including any contingent consideration, to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition with any excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. For those transactions that do not meet the definition of a business combination, we allocate the purchase price to property and equipment for the fair value of the towers and to identifiable intangible assets (primarily acquired customer-related and network location intangibles). The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future customer cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition. The determination of the final purchase price and acquisition-date fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed may extend over more than one period and result in adjustments to the preliminary estimate recognized. • Revenue Recognition: Rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned and when collectibility is reasonably assured, regardless of whether the payments from the tenants are received in equal monthly amounts. Fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease agreements, excluding those tied to the Consumer Price Index or other 61 Table of Contents inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants are recognized on a straight-line basis over the fixed, non-cancellable terms of the applicable leases. Total rental and management straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 approximated $147.7 million, $165.8 million and $144.0 million, respectively. Amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases. Amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met. We derive the largest portion of our revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, and approximately 55% of our revenues are derived from four tenants in the industry. In addition, we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. We mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of our borrowers and tenants. In recognizing customer revenue we must assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense. Accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured. • Rent Expense: Many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time. We calculate straight-line ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. Certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease, if the tenant exercises its renewal option. For towers with these types of tenant leases at the inception of the ground lease, we calculate our straight-line ground rent over the term of the ground lease, including all renewal options to fulfill the tenant lease obligation. In addition to the straight-line ground rent expense recorded, we also record an associated straight-line rent liability in Other non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Leases may contain complex terms that often are subject to interpretation. • Stock-Based Compensation: We measure stock-based compensation cost at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and recognize an expense over the service period, which generally represents the vesting period. Effective January 1, 2013, our Compensation Committee adopted a death, disability and retirement benefits program in connection with equity awards granted on or after January 1, 2013 that provides for accelerated vesting and extended exercise periods of stock options and restricted stock units upon an employee’s death or permanent disability, or upon an employee’s qualified retirement, provided certain eligibility criteria are met. Accordingly, for grants made on or after January 1, 2013, we recognize compensation expense for all stock-based compensation over the shorter of (i) the four-year vesting period or (ii) the period from the date of grant to the date the employee becomes eligible for such retirement benefits, which may occur upon grant. The expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will not fully vest and be forfeited. The fair value of a stock option is determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that takes into account a number of assumptions at the accounting measurement date including the stock price, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock, the expected distributions, and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. These assumptions are highly subjective and could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the compensation expense. The fair value of restricted stock units is 62 Table of Contents based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. We recognize stock-based compensation in either selling, general, administrative and development expense, costs of operations or as part of the costs associated with the construction of our tower assets. • Income Taxes: We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code effective January 1, 2012, and are generally not subject to federal and state income taxes on our QRSs’ taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders provided that we meet certain organizational and operating requirements. However, even as a REIT, we will remain obligated to pay income taxes on earnings from our TRS assets. In addition, our international assets and operations continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted. Accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes. To the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes, deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns, which may differ from the current rate. We do not expect to pay federal taxes on our REIT taxable income. We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. Valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability. We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination, which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit. We consider the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. Should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, we may have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside of the United States. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued additional guidance on comprehensive income which adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) by component. This guidance enhances the transparency of changes in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and items transferred out of AOCI in the financial statements and it does not amend any existing requirements for reporting net income or OCI in the financial statements. Since the guidance relates only to presentation and disclosure of information, the adoption did not have a material effect on our financial statements. In February 2013, the FASB issued guidance that clarifies the scope of transactions subject to disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities. The guidance requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position. This guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after 63 Table of Contents January 1, 2013 on a retrospective basis. Since the guidance relates only to presentation and disclosure of information, the adoption did not have a material effect on our financial statements. In July 2013, the FASB issued guidance that requires an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, to be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, with certain exceptions. The amendment is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial statements. 64 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.

(b) Variable rate debt included the 2012 Credit Facility ($88.0 million), which matures on January 31, 2017, the 2013 Credit Facility ($1.9 billion), which matures on June 28, 2018 and the 2013 Term Loan ($1.5 billion), which matures on January 3, 2019. Variable rate debt also included $88.3 million of indebtedness outstanding under the South African Facility, which amortizes through March 31, 2020, $66.9 million of indebtedness under the Uganda loan, which matures on June 29, 2019, $70.1 million of indebtedness under the Colombian long-term credit facility, which amortizes through November 30, 2020, $377.5 million of indebtedness under the Mexican Loan, which matures on May 1, 2015 and $32.6 million of indebtedness under the Costa Rica Loan, which would have amortized through February 16, 2019 (on February 12, 2014, we repaid the Costa Rica Loan). Interest on the 2012 Credit Facility, the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2013 Term Loan is payable in accordance with the applicable LIBOR agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The interest rate in effect at December 31, 2013 for the 2012 Credit Facility, the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2013 Term Loan was 1.795%, 1.42% and 1.42%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the weighted average interest rate under the 2011 Credit Facility, the 2012 Credit Facility, the 2013 Credit Facility, the 2012 Term Loan and the 2013 Term Loan was 1.73%. Interest on the South African Facility is payable in accordance with the applicable Johannesburg Interbank Agreed Rate (“JIBAR”) agreement and accrues at JIBAR plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2013, after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements in South Africa, was 9.89%. Interest on the Uganda loan is payable in accordance with the applicable LIBOR plus margin (as defined). The Uganda loan accrued interest at 5.98% at December 31, 2013. Interest on the Colombian long-term credit facility is payable in accordance with the applicable Inter-bank Rate (“IBR”) agreement and accrues at IBR plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2013, after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements in Colombia, was 10.13%. Interest on the Mexican Loan is payable in accordance with the applicable TIIE plus margin (as defined). The Mexican Loan accrued interest at 4.04% at December 31, 2013. Interest on the Costa Rica Loan is payable in accordance with LIBOR plus the applicable margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2013, after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements in Costa Rica, was 6.90%. (c) Based on rates effective as of December 31, 2013. (d) Represents the weighted average fixed rate of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts. 65 Table of Contents We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to variability in interest rates on debt in Colombia, Costa Rica and South Africa. All of our interest rate swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges and have an aggregate notional amount of $139.3 million, interest rates ranging from 1.62% to 7.83% and expiration dates through November 2020. On February 12, 2014, we repaid the Costa Rica Loan and subsequently terminated the associated interest rate swap agreements. Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2013, was comprised of $88.0 million under the 2012 Credit Facility, $1,853.0 million under the 2013 Credit Facility, $1,500.0 million under the 2013 Term Loan, $66.9 million under the Uganda loan, $43.6 million under the South African Facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements, $17.5 million under the Colombian long-term credit facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements, $377.5 million under the Mexican Loan and $5.6 million under the Costa Rica Loan after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements. A 10% increase in current interest rates would result in an additional $7.4 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013. We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar is reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity and as a component of comprehensive income (loss). We may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions in order to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations. For the year ended December 31, 2013, approximately 33% of our revenues and approximately 40% of our operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2013, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate by approximately 3%. As of December 31, 2013, we have incurred a substantial amount of additional intercompany debt, which is not considered to be permanently reinvested, and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As this debt had not been designated as being of long-term investment in nature, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. An adverse change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in approximately $228.6 million of unrealized gains or losses that would be included in Other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013.",2023-12-30 19:23:16.437792

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the accompanying notes, and the information set forth under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” below. Our continuing operations are reported in three segments: domestic rental and management, international rental and management and network development services. In evaluating operating performance in each business segment, management uses, among other factors, segment gross margin and segment operating profit. We define segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in costs of operations; Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expense. We define segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. Segment gross margin and segment operating profit for the international rental and management segment also include Interest income, TV Azteca, net (see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before Interest income, Interest expense, Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, Other income (expense), Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest, Income (loss) on equity method investments and Income tax benefit (provision). Executive Overview We are a global independent owner, operator and developer of communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on multi-tenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data and data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. We refer to this business as our rental and management operations, which accounted for approximately 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 and includes our domestic rental and management segment and our international rental and management segment. Through our network development services, we offer tower-related services domestically, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services, which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites, including in connection with provider network upgrades. We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 28 Table of Contents The following table details the number of communications sites, excluding managed sites, we owned or operated as of December 31, 2014: Country Number ofOwned Sites Number ofOperated Sites(1) United States 21,722 7,164 International(2): Brazil 9,642 2,268 Chile 1,161 Colombia 2,884 706 Costa Rica 464 Germany 2,031 Ghana 2,049 India 12,999 Mexico 8,551 199 Peru 571 South Africa 1,918 Uganda 1,265 (1) All of the communications sites we operate are held pursuant to long-term capital leases, including those subject to purchase options. (2) In September 2014, we completed the sale of the operations in Panama. On February 5, 2015, we signed a definitive agreement for the Proposed Verizon Transaction, pursuant to which we expect to acquire the exclusive right to lease, acquire or otherwise operate and manage up to 11,489 wireless communications sites in the United States for $5.056 billion in cash at closing, subject to certain conditions and limited adjustments. The majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers have an initial non-cancellable term of ten years, with multiple renewal terms. Accordingly, nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended December 31, 2014 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2014, we expect to generate approximately $27 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, absent the impact of straight-line lease accounting. Most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually based on a fixed escalation (approximately 3.0% in the United States) or an inflationary index in our international markets, or a combination of both. In addition, certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs. The revenues generated by our rental and management operations may also be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multi-year contracts, which typically are non-cancellable; however in some instances, a lease may be canceled upon the payment of a termination fee. Revenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their terms or rent negotiations historically has not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management operations. During the year ended December 31, 2014, loss of revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented approximately 1.5% of our rental and management operations revenues. Rental and Management Operations Revenue Growth. Due to our diversified communications site portfolio, our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount and type of tenant equipment on the tower, ground space required by the tenant, remaining tower capacity and 29 Table of Contents tower location. We measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. In many instances, tower capacity can be increased through tower augmentation. The primary factors affecting the revenue growth in our domestic and international rental and management segments are: • Recurring organic revenue, which is revenue from tenant leases attributable to sites that existed in our portfolio as of the beginning of the prior year period (“legacy sites”); • Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of cancellations; • New revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our legacy sites; and • New revenue attributable to sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior year period (“new sites”). We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our wireless real estate. By adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, we are able to increase these sites’ utilization and profitability. We believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers. Our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks, while also deploying next generation wireless technologies. In addition, consistent with our signing of a definitive agreement for the Proposed Verizon Transaction, we intend to continue to supplement the organic growth on our legacy sites by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and in new markets where we can achieve our risk-adjusted return on investment objectives. In a majority of our international markets, revenue also includes the reimbursement of direct costs such as ground rent or power and fuel costs. Rental and Management Operations Organic Revenue Growth. Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our legacy sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through collocation and lease amendments. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services, the penetration of advanced wireless devices, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital, and general economic conditions. The following key trends within each market that we serve provide opportunities for organic revenue growth: • Domestic. As a result of the rapid subscriber adoption of bandwidth-intensive wireless data applications and advanced wireless devices, wireless service providers in the United States continue to invest in their wireless networks by adding new cell sites as well as additional equipment to their existing cell sites. Growth in wireless data demand has driven wireless providers in the United States to deploy increasing levels of annual wireless capital investment and as a result, we have experienced strong demand for our communications sites. Based on industry research and projections, we expect the following key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us: • The deployment of advanced wireless technology across existing wireless networks will provide higher speed data services and enable fixed broadband substitution. As a result, we expect our tenants to continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks. • Wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their existing wireless networks, which is driven by capacity and coverage. To maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases, our tenants continue deploying additional equipment across their 30 Table of Contents existing sites while also adding new cell sites. We anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years, as existing network infrastructure is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage. • Wireless service providers are also investing in reinforcing their networks through incremental backhaul and the utilization of on-site generators, which typically results in additional equipment or space leased at the tower site, and incremental revenue. • Wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum, and as a result are expected to add additional sites and equipment to their network as they seek to optimize their network configuration. We have entered into holistic master lease agreements with three of our four largest tenants in the United States, which provide for consistent, long-term revenue and a reduction in the likelihood of churn. Typically, these agreements include built-in annual escalators, fixed annual charges which permit our tenants to place a pre-determined amount of equipment on certain of our sites and provisions for incremental lease payments if the equipment levels are exceeded. Our holistic master lease agreements build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced collocation cycle times, thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites. • International. As part of our international expansion initiatives, we have targeted markets in various stages of network development in order to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term. In addition, we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers such as MTN Group Limited, Telefónica S.A., Vodafone Group PLC and Bharti Airtel Limited. We believe that consistent carrier investments in their networks across our international markets position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward. In emerging markets such as Ghana, India and Uganda, wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the United States, and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in underdeveloped areas. In more developed urban locations within these markets, early-stage data network deployments are underway. Carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while also investing in initial data networks as wireless data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate. In markets with rapidly evolving network technology, such as South Africa and most of the countries in Latin America where we do business, initial voice networks, for the most part, have already been built out, and carriers are focused on third generation (3G) network build outs and augmentations, with select initial investments in fourth generation (4G) technology. Recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks. Smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are growing rapidly, which mandates that carriers continue to invest in their networks in order to maintain and augment their quality of service. Finally, in markets with more mature network technology such as Germany, carriers are focused on deploying 4G data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage. With a more mature customer base, higher smartphone penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage, carrier investment in networks is focused on 4G coverage and capacity. We believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the United States, which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years, will ultimately be replicated in our less advanced international markets. As a result, we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 46,700 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier customers to drive sustainable, long-term growth. 31 Table of Contents Rental and Management Operations New Site Revenue Growth. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 8,450 sites. In a majority of our international markets, the acquisition or construction of new sites results in increased pass-through revenues (such as ground rent or power and fuel costs) and expenses. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios, both domestically and internationally, to determine whether they meet our risk-adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio. New Sites (Acquired or Constructed) 2014 2013 2012 Domestic 900 5,260 960 International(1) 7,550 7,810 7,850 (1) The majority of sites acquired or constructed in 2014 were in Brazil, India and Mexico; in 2013 were in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, India, Mexico and South Africa; and in 2012 were in Brazil, Germany, India and Uganda. Rental and Management Operations Expenses. Direct operating expenses incurred by our domestic and international rental and management segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs, some of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes, repairs and maintenance. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled Selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our domestic and international rental and management segments’ selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow. We may, however, incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on expanding our portfolio. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities. Network Development Services Segment Revenue Growth. As we continue to focus on growing our rental and management operations, we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (“Adjusted EBITDA”), Funds From Operations, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT FFO”) and Adjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO”). We define Adjusted EBITDA as Net income before Income (loss) on discontinued operations, net; Income (loss) on equity method investments; Income tax benefit (provision); Other income (expense); Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; Interest expense; Interest income; Other operating income (expense); Depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense. NAREIT FFO is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends declared on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interest. 32 Table of Contents We define AFFO as NAREIT FFO before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) the non-cash portion of our tax provision; (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion; (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges; (vi) other income (expense); (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; (viii) other operating income (expense); and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interest, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO and AFFO are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Neither NAREIT FFO nor AFFO represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO and AFFO are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for purposes of decision making and for evaluating the performance of our operating segments; (2) Adjusted EBITDA is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain debt covenants; (3) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the tower industry to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4) each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (5) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies. Our measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO and AFFO may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO and AFFO to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included below.

The increase in international rental and management segment SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to the impact of increased personnel costs to support our business, including additional costs associated with acquisitions, partially offset by decreases attributable to impacts of foreign currency fluctuations, as well as the reversal of bad debt expense for amounts previously reserved. The increase in network development services segment SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to higher personnel costs related to the additional site acquisition, zoning and permitting services associated with certain tenants’ next generation technology network upgrade projects, including an increase in volume as a result of the additional sites acquired as part of the acquisition of MIPT. 35 Table of Contents The decrease in other SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in corporate SG&A of $15.5 million, which was partially offset by an increase of $11.7 million related to stock-based compensation expense. The decrease in corporate SG&A was primarily related to a reduction in legal expenses of $22.5 million, including the recovery of expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014, and the reversal of a $2.8 million reserve associated with a non-recurring state tax item. The decrease in corporate SG&A was partially offset by an increase in personnel costs to support our business.

Other SG&A for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 28% to $179.0 million. The increase was primarily due to a $16.4 million increase in SG&A related stock-based compensation expense, which included an incremental $7.8 million due to the timing of recognition of expense associated with awards granted to retirement eligible employees. In addition, other SG&A increased $23.2 million, which included, among other things, an increase of $26.9 million in corporate expenses, partially offset by a $3.7 million non-recurring state tax item recorded during the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase in corporate expenses included approximately $14.8 million of legal expenses.

The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our domestic rental and management segment gross margin (13%), as described above, and was partially offset by increases in our domestic rental and management segment SG&A (21%), as described above. International rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 27% to $574.3 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our international rental and management segment gross margin (27%), as described above, and was partially offset by increases in our international rental and management segment SG&A (29%), as described above. Network development services segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 12% to $34.5 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the increase in network development services segment gross margin (16%), as described above, and was partially offset by an increase in our network development services segment SG&A (37%), as described above. 42 Table of Contents Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2013 2012 Depreciation, amortization and accretion $ 800,145 $ 644,276 $ 155,869 24 % Depreciation, amortization and accretion for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 24% to $800.1 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the depreciation, amortization and accretion associated with the acquisition or construction of approximately 21,880 sites since January 1, 2012, which resulted in an increase in property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization. Other Operating Expenses Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2013 2012 Other operating expenses $ 71,539 $ 62,185 $ 9,354 15 % Other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 15% to $71.5 million primarily due to an increase of approximately $11.9 million in acquisition related costs. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately $1.9 million in losses from the sale or disposal of assets and impairment charges.

During the year ended December 31, 2013, we received a payment from TV Azteca, which included $28.0 million of principal on the notes receivable from TV Azteca, related interest and a prepayment penalty of $4.9 million. In addition, we recorded additional interest income of $2.7 million related to the write-off of a portion of the unamortized discount associated with the original notes receivable.

The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our average debt outstanding of approximately $2.9 billion, which was primarily used to fund our acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in our annualized weighted average cost of borrowing from 5.37% to 4.40%. The weighted average contractual interest rate was 3.84% at December 31, 2013. Loss on Retirement of Long-Term Obligations Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2013 2012 Loss on retirement of long-term obligations $ 38,701 $ 398 $ 38,303 9,624 % 43 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2013, loss on retirement of long-term obligations increased to $38.7 million. We recorded a loss of $35.3 million due to the repayment of the $1.75 billion outstanding balance of the Certificates and incurred prepayment consideration and recorded the acceleration of deferred financing costs. In addition, we recorded a loss of $3.4 million related to the acceleration of the remaining deferred financing costs associated with the 2011 Credit Facility, which was terminated in June 2013, and the 2012 Term Loan, which was terminated in October 2013. Other Expense Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2013 2012 Other expense $ 207,500 $ 38,300 $ 169,200 442 % During the year ended December 31, 2013, other expense increased to $207.5 million. The increase was primarily a result of an increase in unrealized foreign currency losses of $177.4 million. During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we recorded unrealized foreign currency losses of approximately $211.7 million and $34.3 million, respectively, resulting primarily from fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates associated with our intercompany notes and similar unaffiliated balances denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The increase in unrealized foreign currency losses is primarily due to the negative impact associated with fluctuations in GHS and BRL. Income Tax Provision Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2013 2012 Income tax provision $ 59,541 $ 107,304 $ (47,763 ) (45 )% Effective tax rate 11.0 % 15.3 % The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased 45% to $59.5 million. The ETR for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased to 11.0% from 15.3%. The ETR during the year ended December 31, 2012 included an increase of 8% due to a valuation allowance recorded on certain previously unreserved deferred tax assets. The ETR during the year ended December 31, 2013 included an increase of 4% due to the restructuring of our domestic TRSs. As a REIT, we may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated in our QRSs. In addition, we are able to offset income in both our TRSs and QRSs by utilizing our NOLs, subject to specified limitations. The ETR on income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to our qualification for taxation as a REIT effective as of January 1, 2012 and adjustments for foreign items. 44 Table of Contents Net Income/Adjusted EBITDA Year Ended December 31, Amount ofIncrease(Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2013 2012 Net income $ 482,208 $ 594,025 $ (111,817 ) (19 )% Income on equity method investments — (35 ) (35 ) (100 ) Income tax provision 59,541 107,304 (47,763 ) (45 ) Other expense 207,500 38,300 169,200 442 Loss on retirement of long-term obligations 38,701 398 38,303 9,624 Interest expense 458,296 401,665 56,631 14 Interest income (9,706 ) (7,680 ) 2,026 26 Other operating expenses 71,539 62,185 9,354 15 Depreciation, amortization and accretion 800,145 644,276 155,869 24 Stock-based compensation expense 68,138 51,983 16,155 31 Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,176,362 $ 1,892,421 $ 283,941 15 % Net income for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased 19% to $482.2 million. The increase in our operating profit of $307.2 million, as described above, was partially offset by increases in corporate SG&A, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, interest expense and a loss on retirement of long-term obligations recorded during the year ended December 31, 2013. In addition, the increase in our operating profit was partially offset by an increase in other expenses, primarily due to unrealized foreign currency losses. Net income was positively impacted by a decrease in our income tax provision. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 15% to $2,176.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin of $355.8 million, and was partially offset by an increase in SG&A of $71.9 million, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense.

AFFO for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased 20% to $1,469.5 million as compared to $1,222.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. AFFO growth was primarily attributable to the increase in our operating profit and a decrease in cash paid for income taxes, partially offset by an increase in corporate SG&A, cash paid for interest and capital improvement and corporate capital expenditures. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview During the year ended December 31, 2014, we raised capital, thereby increasing our financial flexibility and our ability to grow our business while reducing our leverage, consistent with our long-term financial policies. Our significant 2014 financing transactions included: • The completion of registered public offerings (i) through a reopening of the 3.40% Notes and a reopening of the 5.00% Notes, in aggregate principal amounts of $250.0 million and $500.0 million, respectively and (ii) of the 3.450% Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $650.0 million. We used the net proceeds from each offering to repay certain indebtedness under our existing credit facilities. • The completion of a registered public offering of 6,000,000 shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. We used the net proceeds of $582.9 million to fund acquisitions initially funded by indebtedness incurred under the 2013 Credit Facility. • The amendment and restatement of our 2012 Credit Facility, which, among other things, increased the commitments thereunder to $1.5 billion and extended the maturity date to January 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $2.7 billion of total liquidity, comprised of approximately $313.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and the ability to borrow up to $2.4 billion, net of outstanding letters of credit, under the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility. Summary cash flow information for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 is set forth below (in thousands): 2014 2013 2012 Net cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 2,134,589 $ 1,599,047 $ 1,414,391 Investing activities (1,949,548 ) (5,173,337 ) (2,558,385 ) Financing activities (134,591 ) 3,525,565 1,170,366 Net effect of changes in exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (30,534 ) (26,317 ) 12,055 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 19,916 $ (75,042 ) $ 38,427 We use our cash flows to fund our operations and investments in our business, including tower maintenance and improvements, communications site construction and managed network installations, and tower and land acquisitions. Additionally, we use our cash flows to make distributions, including distributions of our REIT taxable income to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We may also repurchase our existing indebtedness from time to time. We typically fund our international expansion efforts primarily through a combination of cash on hand, intercompany debt and equity contributions. As of December 31, 2014, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $14.6 billion, with a current portion of $897.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and debt service obligations, as well as our required REIT 46 Table of Contents distributions. We believe the cash generated by operating activities during the year ending December 31, 2015, together with our increased borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and bridge loan commitment, will be sufficient to fund our required distributions, capital expenditures, debt service obligations (interest and principal repayments) and signed acquisitions. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $185.8 million of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $67.1 million was held by our joint ventures. Historically, it has not been our practice to repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs. However, in the event that we do repatriate any funds, we may be required to accrue and pay taxes. Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the year ended December 31, 2014, cash provided by operating activities increased $535.5 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the operating profit of our rental and management segments, cash provided by working capital and a decrease in restricted cash, partially offset by increases in cash paid for interest and taxes. Working capital was positively impacted by the receipt of capital contributions from tenants and a value added tax refund, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2013, cash provided by operating activities increased $184.7 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the operating profit of our rental and management segments as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, partially offset by increases in Other SG&A and cash paid for interest and a decrease in cash provided by working capital. Working capital was positively impacted by the receipt of capital contributions from tenants and partially offset by an increase in prepaid assets. Cash Flows from Investing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2014, cash used for investing activities decreased approximately $3,223.8 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Our significant investing activities in 2014 included the following: • We spent $974.4 million for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities, including (i) $521.6 million of capital expenditures for discretionary capital projects, such as completion of the construction of approximately 3,133 communications sites and the installation of approximately 530 shared generators domestically, (ii) $133.7 million spent to acquire land under our towers that was subject to ground agreements (including leases), (iii) $99.2 million of capital expenditures related to capital improvements primarily attributable to our communications sites and corporate capital expenditures primarily attributable to information technology improvements, (iv) $194.4 million for the redevelopment of existing communications sites to accommodate new tenant equipment and (v) $25.5 million of capital expenditures related to start-up capital projects primarily attributable to acquisitions and new market launches and costs that are contemplated in the business cases for these investments. • We completed the acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of BR Towers for an estimated preliminary purchase price of approximately $568.9 million, net of debt assumed and outstanding preferred stock. • We spent $441.7 million for the acquisition of an aggregate of approximately 400 communications sites in Brazil, Ghana, Mexico, Uganda and the United States, as well as to satisfy obligations related to sites acquired during the year ended December 31, 2013 in Brazil, South Africa and the United States. 47 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2013, cash used for investing activities increased approximately $2,615.0 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Our significant investing transactions in 2013 included the following: • We spent $724.5 million for purchases of property and equipment and construction activities, including (i) $381.6 million of capital expenditures for discretionary capital projects, such as completion of the construction of approximately 2,370 communications sites and the installation of approximately 1,310 shared generators domestically, (ii) $83.8 million spent to acquire land under our towers that was subject to ground agreements (including leases), (iii) $111.6 million of capital expenditures related to capital improvements primarily attributable to our communications sites and corporate capital expenditures primarily attributable to information technology improvements, (iv) $120.8 million for the redevelopment of existing communications sites to accommodate new tenant equipment and (v) $26.7 million of capital expenditures related to start-up capital projects primarily attributable to acquisitions and new market launches and costs that are contemplated in the business cases for these investments. • We completed the acquisition of MIPT for a purchase price of approximately $4.9 billion, funded by cash payments of $3.3 billion and the assumption of approximately $1.5 billion of existing MIPT debt. In addition, we spent $1.2 billion to acquire approximately 5,330 communications sites in our legacy markets, primarily in Mexico and Brazil. We plan to continue to allocate our available capital, after satisfying our distribution requirements, among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria. Accordingly, we expect to continue to deploy our capital through our annual capital expenditure program, including land purchases and new site construction, and through acquisitions. We expect that our 2015 total capital expenditures will be between approximately $800 million and $900 million, including: (i) between $105 million and $115 million for capital improvements and corporate capital expenditures, (ii) between $30 million and $40 million for start-up capital projects, (iii) between $155 million and $175 million for the redevelopment of existing communications sites, (iv) between $170 million and $190 million for ground lease purchases and (v) between $340 million and $380 million for other discretionary capital projects including the construction of approximately 2,750 to 3,250 new communications sites.

Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock Offering. On May 12, 2014, we completed a registered public offering of 6,000,000 shares of our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. The net proceeds of the offering 48 Table of Contents were $582.9 million after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. We used the net proceeds from this offering to fund acquisitions, including the acquisition from Richland, initially funded by indebtedness incurred under the 2013 Credit Facility. Unless converted earlier, each share of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically convert on May 15, 2017, into between 0.9174 and 1.1468 shares of common stock, depending on the applicable market value of the common stock and subject to anti-dilution adjustments. Dividends on shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock are payable on a cumulative basis when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors (or an authorized committee thereof) at an annual rate of 5.25% on the liquidation preference of $100.00 per share, on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing on August 15, 2014 to, and including, May 15, 2017. We may pay dividends in cash or, subject to certain limitations, in shares of common stock or any combination of cash and shares of common stock. The terms of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock provide that, unless full cumulative dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock for all prior dividend periods, no dividends may be declared or paid on common stock. GTP Notes. In connection with our acquisition of MIPT, we assumed approximately $1.49 billion principal amount of existing indebtedness issued by certain subsidiaries of GTP in several securitization transactions. GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC (“GTP Partners”) issued the Series 2011-1 notes, Series 2011-2 notes and Series 2013-1 notes, and GTP Cellular Sites, LLC (“GTP Cellular Sites,” and together with GTP Partners, the “GTP Issuers”) issued the Series 2012-1 notes and Series 2012-2 notes. In August 2014, we repaid in full the aggregate principal amount outstanding of $250.0 million under the Series 2010-1 Class C Notes and the Series 2010-1 Class F Notes issued by GTP Towers Issuer, LLC (together, the “Series 2010-1 Notes”).

BR Towers Debt. In connection with the acquisition of BR Towers, we assumed approximately 671.5 million BRL (approximately $261.1 million based on exchange rates at the date of closing) aggregate principal amount of existing indebtedness consisting of (i) 323.4 million of BRL denominated privately issued simple debentures (“BR Towers Private Debentures”) (with an original principal amount of 330.0 million BRL), (ii) 313.1 million BRL of denominated publicly issued simple debentures (“BR Towers Debentures”) (with an original principal amount of 300.0 million BRL) issued by a subsidiary of BR Towers (the “BRT Issuer”), and (iii) a BRL denominated credit facility with Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social, which 49 Table of Contents allows a subsidiary of BR Towers (the “BRT Borrower”) to borrow up to 48.1 million BRL through an intermediary bank (the “BR Towers Credit Facility”). On December 11, 2014, we repaid all amounts outstanding under the BR Towers Private Debentures, which included a prepayment penalty of 3.2 million BRL (approximately $1.2 million on the date of repayment). The BR Towers Debentures were issued on October 15, 2013, and have a maturity date of October 15, 2023. The BR Towers Debentures bear interest at a rate of 7.40%. The aggregate principal amount of the BR Towers Debentures may be adjusted periodically relative to changes in the National Extended Consumer Price Index. Any such increase in the principal amount will be capitalized in a manner consistent with the agreement governing the BR Towers Debentures (the “Debenture Agreement”). Payments of principal and interest are made quarterly, beginning on January 15, 2014, in accordance with the amortization schedule set forth in the Debenture Agreement. We may redeem the BR Towers Debentures beginning on October 15, 2018 at the then outstanding principal amount plus a surcharge, calculated in accordance with the Debenture Agreement, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon. As of December 31, 2014, we had 315.3 million BRL (approximately $118.7 million) aggregate principal amount outstanding under the BR Towers Debentures. The BR Towers Debentures are secured by (i) 100% of the shares of the BRT Issuer and (ii) all proceeds and rights from the issuance of the BR Towers Debentures, including amounts in a Resource Account (as defined in the applicable agreement). The Debenture Agreement includes contractual covenants and other restrictions customary for public debentures. Among other things, the Debenture Agreement requires that (i) the BRT Issuer maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.10, (ii) the risk rating of the BR Towers Debentures not be downgraded by two or more notches, (iii) the BRT Issuer meet certain conditions to distribute dividends or interest on the issuer’s own capital, (iv) the issuer not incur additional indebtedness in an aggregate amount greater than 5.0 million BRL (which amount is subject to adjustment as set forth in the agreement) and (v) the issuer maintain a leverage index (as defined in the Debenture Agreement) of at least 30%. The BR Towers Credit Facility consists of three sublimits of 20.2 million BRL, 27.6 million BRL and 0.2 million BRL, respectively. The sublimits mature between July 15, 2020 and January 15, 2022 and had interest rates between 3.50% and 10.80% as of December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, 43.5 million BRL (approximately $16.4 million) was outstanding under the BR Towers Credit Facility and the BRT Borrower maintains the ability to draw down the remaining 4.6 million BRL (approximately $1.7 million) until June 26, 2015. The BR Towers Credit Facility is secured by the conditional assignment of receivables. Mexican Loan. In connection with the acquisition of towers in Mexico from NII Holdings, Inc. (“NII”) during the fourth quarter of 2013, one of our Mexican subsidiaries entered into a 5.2 billion MXN denominated unsecured bridge loan (the “Mexican Loan”) and subsequently borrowed approximately 4.9 billion MXN (approximately $374.7 million at the date of borrowing). Our Mexican subsidiary’s ability to further draw under the Mexican Loan expired in February 2014. The Mexican Loan bears interest at a margin over the Equilibrium Interbank Interest Rate (“TIIE”). During the year ended December 31, 2014, our Mexican subsidiary repaid 1.1 billion MXN (approximately $80.4 million on the date of repayment) of the outstanding indebtedness using cash on hand. As of December 31, 2014, the current margin over TIIE was 1.50%. Ghana Loan and 2014 Ghana Loan. During the year ended December 31, 2014, our joint venture in Ghana with MTN Group Limited converted $175.2 million of existing notes under the U.S. Dollar-denominated shareholder loan (the “Ghana Loan”) into a new 220.9 million GHS (approximately $68.7 million) denominated shareholder loan (the “2014 Ghana Loan”), as the borrower, with one of our wholly owned subsidiaries (the “ATC Ghana Subsidiary”) and a wholly owned subsidiary of MTN Ghana (the “MTN Ghana Subsidiary”), as the 50 Table of Contents lenders. The 2014 Ghana Loan accrues interest at 21.87% per annum and matures on December 31, 2019. The portion of the loans made by the ATC Ghana Subsidiary is eliminated in consolidation and the portion of the loans made by the MTN Ghana Subsidiary is reported as outstanding debt. Colombian Credit Facility. On October 14, 2014, one of our Colombian subsidiaries (“ATC Sitios”) entered into a loan agreement for a new 200.0 billion COP (approximately $96.8 million at the date of borrowing) denominated long-term credit facility (the “Colombian Credit Facility”). On October 24, 2014, ATC Sitios used borrowings under the Colombian Credit Facility, together with cash on hand, to repay the Colombian Long-Term Credit Facility, as well as to repay six COP denominated bridge loans, which one of our Colombian subsidiaries had entered into in connection with the acquisition of communications sites in Colombia. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity. The Colombian Credit Facility may be prepaid in whole or in part, subject to certain limitations and prepayment consideration, at any time. Principal and interest are payable quarterly in arrears with principal due in accordance with the repayment schedule included in the loan agreement. Interest accrues at a per annum rate equal to 4.00% above the three-month Inter-bank Rate (“IBR”) in effect at the beginning of each Interest Period (as defined in the loan agreement). The loan agreement also requires that ATC Sitios manage exposure to variability in interest rates on certain of the amounts outstanding under the Colombian Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2014, the interest rate, after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements, is 9.05%. The Colombian Credit Facility is secured by, among other things, liens on towers owned by ATC Sitios. The loan agreement contains certain reporting, information, financial ratios and operating covenants. Failure to comply with certain of the financial and operating covenants would constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. Colombian Loan. In connection with the establishment of our joint venture with Millicom International Cellular SA (“Millicom”) and the acquisition of certain communications sites in Colombia, ATC Colombia B.V., our majority owned subsidiary, entered into a U.S. Dollar-denominated shareholder loan agreement (the “Colombian Loan”), as the borrower, with our wholly owned subsidiary (the “ATC Colombian Subsidiary”), and a wholly owned subsidiary of Millicom (the “Millicom Subsidiary”), as the lenders. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the joint venture borrowed an additional $3.0 million under the Colombian Loan, which was subsequently converted from debt to equity. In July 2014, we purchased Millicom’s interest in the joint venture and the Colombian Loan using proceeds from borrowings under the 2013 Credit Facility. Costa Rica Loan. In connection with our acquisition of MIPT, we assumed $32.6 million of secured debt in Costa Rica (the “Costa Rica Loan”), which we repaid in full in February 2014. Richland Notes. In connection with our acquisition of entities holding a portfolio of communications sites from Richland, we assumed approximately $196.5 million of secured debt (the “Richland Notes”), which we repaid in full in June 2014. Short-Term Credit Facility. In September 2013, we entered into a $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Short-Term Credit Facility”), which matured on September 19, 2014. The Short-Term Credit Facility was undrawn at the time of maturity. 2013 Credit Facility. In June 2013, we entered into the 2013 Credit Facility. The 2013 Credit Facility has a term of five years and includes two optional one-year renewal periods. The current margin over the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) that we incur on borrowings (should we choose LIBOR Advances) is 1.250% and the current commitment fee on the undrawn portion is 0.150%. 51 Table of Contents On September 19, 2014, we entered into an amendment agreement with respect to the 2013 Credit Facility, which (i) amended the limitation on indebtedness of, and guaranteed by, our subsidiaries to the greater of (x) $800.0 million and (y) 50% of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the 2013 Credit Facility) on a consolidated basis as of the last day of the most recently completed fiscal quarter and (ii) permitted indebtedness owed by certain of our subsidiaries to our joint venture partners. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we borrowed $912.0 million and repaid an aggregate of $2.8 billion of revolving indebtedness under the 2013 Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2014, we had no amounts outstanding and approximately $3.2 million of undrawn letters of credit under the 2013 Credit Facility. In February 2015, we borrowed a net amount of $115.0 million under the 2013 Credit Facility. We maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the 2013 Credit Facility in the ordinary course. 2013 Term Loan. In October 2013, we entered into a $1.5 billion unsecured term loan (the “2013 Term Loan”). The 2013 Term Loan includes an expansion option allowing us to request additional commitments of up to $500.0 million. On September 19, 2014, we entered into an amendment agreement with respect to the 2013 Term Loan, which (i) amended the limitation on indebtedness of, and guaranteed by, our subsidiaries to the greater of (x) $800.0 million and (y) 50% of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the 2013 Term Loan) on a consolidated basis as of the last day of the most recently completed fiscal quarter and (ii) permitted indebtedness owed by certain of our subsidiaries to our joint venture partners. The 2013 Term Loan matures on January 3, 2019, and the current margin over LIBOR is 1.250%. 2014 Credit Facility. On September 19, 2014, we entered into the 2014 Credit Facility, which amended and restated the 2012 Credit Facility to, among other things, (i) increase the commitments thereunder to $1.5 billion, including a $50.0 million sublimit for swingline loans and a $200.0 million sublimit for letters of credit, (ii) extend the maturity date to January 31, 2020, including up to two optional renewal periods, (iii) amend the limitation on indebtedness of, and guaranteed by, our subsidiaries to the greater of (x) $800.0 million and (y) 50% of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the 2014 Credit Facility) on a consolidated basis as of the last day of the most recently completed fiscal quarter, (iv) permit indebtedness owed by certain of our subsidiaries to our joint venture partners and (v) add an expansion feature, which allows us to request up to an aggregate of $500.0 million in additional commitments upon satisfaction of certain conditions. Amounts borrowed under the 2014 Credit Facility will bear interest, at our option, at a margin above LIBOR or the Base Rate. For LIBOR based borrowings, interest rates will range from 1.125% to 2.000% above LIBOR. For Base Rate borrowings, interest rates will range from 0.125% to 1.000% above the Base Rate. In each case, the applicable margin is based upon our debt ratings. In addition, the 2014 Credit Facility requires a quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the commitments ranging from 0.125% to 0.400% per annum, based upon our debt ratings. The current margin over LIBOR that we incur on borrowings is 1.250%, and the current commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the commitments is 0.150%. The 2014 Credit Facility does not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. The loan agreement contains certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply. Any failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreement would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds, but would constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we borrowed $1.3 billion and repaid an aggregate of $263.0 million of revolving indebtedness under the 2014 Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2014, we had $1.1 billion 52 Table of Contents outstanding and approximately $8.0 million of undrawn letters of credit. We maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the 2014 Credit Facility in the ordinary course. Amendments to Bank Facilities. On February 5, 2015 and February 20, 2015, we entered into amendment agreements with respect to the 2013 Term Loan, the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility. After giving effect to these amendments, our permitted ratio of Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the loan agreements for each of the facilities) is (i) 6.00 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2014 through the end of the fiscal quarter ending immediately prior to the closing of the Proposed Verizon Transaction, (ii) 7.25 to 1.00 for the first and second fiscal quarters ending on or after the closing of the Proposed Verizon Transaction, (iii) 7.00 to 1.00 for the two subsequent fiscal quarters and (iii) 6.00 to 1.00 thereafter. In addition, the maximum Incremental Term Loan Commitments (as defined in the agreement governing the 2013 Term Loan) was increased to $1.0 billion and the maximum Revolving Loan Commitments, after giving effect to any Incremental Commitments (each as defined in the loan agreements for each of the revolving credit facilities) was increased to $3.5 billion and $2.5 billion under the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility, respectively. Effective February 20, 2015, we received incremental commitments for an additional $500.0 million under each of the 2013 Term Loan and 2014 Credit Facility and $750.0 million under the 2013 Credit Facility. As a result, we have $2.0 billion outstanding under the 2013 Term Loan and may borrow up to $2.0 billion and $2.75 billion under the 2014 Credit Facility and the 2013 Credit Facility, respectively. Bridge Facility. In connection with the signing of a definitive agreement for the Proposed Verizon Transaction, we entered into a commitment letter (the “Commitment Letter”), dated February 5, 2015, with Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC (collectively, the “Commitment Parties”), pursuant to which the Commitment Parties have committed to provide up to $5.05 billion in bridge loans (the “Bridge Loan Commitment”) to ensure financing for the Proposed Verizon Transaction. Effective February 20, 2015, the Bridge Loan Commitment was reduced to $3.3 billion as a result of an aggregate of $1.75 billion of additional committed amounts under our existing bank facilities, as described above. The Commitment Letter contains, and the credit agreement in respect of the Bridge Loan Commitment, if any, will contain, certain customary conditions to funding, including, without limitation, (i) no material adverse effect with respect to Verizon’s land interests, towers, certain related improvements and tower related assets associated with each communications site having occurred since December 31, 2014, (ii) the execution and delivery of definitive financing agreements for the Bridge Loan Commitment and (iii) other customary closing conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter. We will pay certain customary commitment fees and, in the event we make any borrowings, funding and other fees in connection with the Bridge Loan Commitment. Senior Notes Offerings 3.40% Senior Notes and 5.00% Senior Notes Offering. On January 10, 2014, we completed a registered public offering of reopened 3.40% Notes and reopened 5.00% Notes in aggregate principal amounts of $250.0 million and $500.0 million, respectively. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $763.8 million, after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. As a result, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of each of the 3.40% Notes and the 5.00% Notes is $1.0 billion. We used a portion of the proceeds, together with cash on hand, to repay $88.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under the 2014 Credit Facility and $710.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under the 2013 Credit Facility. The reopened 3.40% Notes issued on January 10, 2014 have identical terms as, are fungible with and are part of a single series of senior debt securities with the 3.40% Notes issued on August 19, 2013. The reopened 5.00% Notes issued on January 10, 2014 have identical terms as, are fungible with and are part of a single series of senior debt securities with the 5.00% Notes issued on August 19, 2013. The 3.40% Notes mature on February 15, 2019 and bear interest at a rate of 3.40% per annum. The 5.00% Notes mature on February 15, 2024 and bear interest at a rate of 5.00% per annum. Accrued and unpaid interest on the 3.40% Notes and the 5.00% Notes is payable in U.S. Dollars semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning 53 Table of Contents on February 15, 2014. Interest on the 3.40% Notes and the 5.00% Notes accrues from August 19, 2013 and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. 3.450% Senior Notes Offering. On August 7, 2014, we completed a registered public offering of the 3.450% Notes, in an aggregate principal amount of $650.0 million. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $641.1 million, after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. We used the proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under the 2013 Credit Facility. The 3.450% Notes mature on September 15, 2021 and bear interest at a rate of 3.450% per annum. Accrued and unpaid interest on the 3.450% Notes is payable in U.S. Dollars semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2015. Interest on the 3.450% Notes accrues from August 7, 2014 and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. We may redeem the 3.40% Notes, the 5.00% Notes and the 3.450% Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such notes, plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date. If we undergo a change of control and ratings decline, each as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture governing such notes, we may be required to repurchase all of the 3.40% Notes, the 5.00% Notes or the 3.450% Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if any), up to but not including the repurchase date. The 3.40% Notes, the 5.00% Notes and the 3.450% Notes rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries. Each of the applicable supplemental indentures for the 3.40% Notes, the 5.00% Notes and the 3.450% Notes contain certain covenants that restrict our ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and its (together with our subsidiaries’) ability to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that we and our subsidiaries may incur certain liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness, if the aggregate amount of such liens shall not exceed 3.5x Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in each of the supplemental indentures. Redemption of 4.625% Senior Notes. On February 11, 2015, we redeemed all of the outstanding 4.625% senior notes due 2015 (the “4.625% Notes”). In accordance with the redemption provisions and the indenture for the 4.625% Notes, the 4.625% Notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100.5898% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, February 11, 2015, for an aggregate purchase price of $613.6 million, including approximately $10.0 million of accrued and unpaid interest, which was funded with borrowings under the 2013 Credit Facility. Upon completion of this redemption, none of the 4.625% Notes remained outstanding. Stock Repurchase Program. In March 2011, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to purchase up to $1.5 billion of common stock (the “2011 Buyback”). In September 2013, we temporarily suspended repurchases in connection with our acquisition of MIPT. Sales of Equity Securities. We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plans. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we received an aggregate of $62.3 million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and from our employee stock purchase plan. Distributions. As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we have distributed, and expect to continue to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income after taking into consideration our utilization of NOLs. Since our conversion to a REIT in 2012, we have distributed an aggregate of approximately $1.3 billion to our common stockholders, which is primarily taxed as ordinary income. 54 Table of Contents The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will be declared based upon various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we declared an aggregate of $554.6 million in regular cash distributions to our common stockholders, which included our fourth quarter distribution of $0.38 per share (approximately $150.7 million) payable on January 13, 2015 to common stockholders of record at the close of business on December 16, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we declared an aggregate of $23.9 million in cash distributions to our preferred stockholders, which included a dividend of $1.3125 per share (approximately $7.9 million), payable on February 16, 2015 to preferred stockholders of record at the close of business on February 1, 2015. We accrue distributions on unvested restricted stock unit awards granted subsequent to January 1, 2012, which are payable upon vesting. As of December 31, 2014, the amount accrued for distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units was $3.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we paid $0.7 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units. For more details on the regular cash distributions paid to our common stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2014, see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.

(2) Represents anticipated repayment date; final legal maturity date is March 15, 2048. (3) In connection with our acquisition of MIPT on October 1, 2013, we assumed approximately $1.49 billion aggregate principal amount of secured notes, $250.0 million of which we repaid in August 2014. The GTP Notes have anticipated repayment dates beginning June 15, 2016. (4) Assumed in connection with our acquisition of BR Towers and denominated in BRL. The BR Towers Debenture amortizes through October 2023. The BR Towers Credit Facility amortizes through January 15, 2022. (5) Assumed by us in connection with the Unison Acquisition, and have anticipated repayment dates of April 15, 2017, April 15, 2020 and April 15, 2020, respectively, and a final maturity date of April 15, 2040.

(9) Reflects balances owed to our joint venture partners in Ghana and Uganda. The Ghana loan is denominated in GHS and the Uganda loan is denominated in USD. (10) On February 11, 2015, we redeemed all of the outstanding 4.625% Notes in accordance with the terms thereof. (11) Includes payments under non-cancellable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option, which we expect to renew because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases. (12) Primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other non-current liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily our straight-line rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash. (13) Excludes $26.6 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and $24.9 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled. Settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations. We expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe. However, based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements, we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes, if any, to previously recorded uncertain tax positions. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Interest Rate Swap Agreements. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to variability in interest rates on debt in Colombia and South Africa. All of our interest rate swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges and have an aggregate notional amount of $79.9 million, interest rates ranging from 5.74% to 7.83% and expiration dates through April 2021. In February 2014, we repaid the Costa Rica Loan and subsequently terminated the associated interest rate swap agreements. Additionally, in connection with entering into the Colombian Credit Facility in October 2014, we terminated our pre-existing interest rate 56 Table of Contents swap agreement and entered into a new interest rate swap agreement with an aggregate notional value of 100.0 billion COP (approximately $41.8 million). Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Our liquidity is dependent on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities, borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness. We believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants, our compliance with which would be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity. Internally Generated Funds. Because the majority of our tenant leases are multi-year contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management operations as of the end of 2014 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites. Restrictions Under Loan Agreements Relating to Our Credit Facilities. The loan agreements for the 2014 Credit Facility, the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2013 Term Loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreements also contain covenants that establish three financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to (i) total leverage, (ii) senior secured leverage and (iii) interest coverage, as set forth below. As of December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (each as defined in the loan agreements) of 6.00 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we could incur approximately $1.7 billion of additional indebtedness and still remain in compliance with this ratio. In addition, if we maintain our existing debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $291 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. On February 20, 2015, we entered into amendments to the 2013 Term Loan, 2013 Credit Facility and 2014 Credit Facility, pursuant to which this ratio will be increased upon the closing of the Proposed Verizon Transaction. Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio: This ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of Senior Secured Debt to Adjusted EBITDA (each as defined in the loan agreements) of 3.00 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, we could incur approximately $4.5 billion of additional Senior Secured Debt and still remain in compliance with the current ratio (effectively, however, this ratio would be limited to $1.7 billion to remain in compliance with other covenants). In addition, if we maintain our existing Senior Secured Debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $1.5 billion and we would still remain in compliance with the current ratio. Interest Coverage Ratio: In the event our debt ratings fall below investment grade, we will be required to maintain a ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense (each as defined in the loan agreements) of not less than 2.50 to 1.00. Based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, our interest expense, which was $549 million for that period, could increase by approximately $532 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. In addition, if our expenses do not change materially from current levels, our revenues could decrease by approximately $1.3 billion and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio. 57 Table of Contents The loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants. Any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but would constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next twelve months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. Restrictions Under Agreements Relating to the Securitization and the GTP Notes. The First Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement related to the Securitization (the “Loan Agreement”) and indentures governing the GTP Notes (the “GTP Indentures”) include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (the “Borrowers”), and the GTP Issuers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the Loan Agreement or the applicable GTP Indenture). Under the terms of the agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the nonrecourse loan relating to the Securitization (the “Loan”) or the GTP Notes (as applicable), which must be deposited, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of the assets securing the Loan or the GTP Notes are released to the Borrowers or the applicable GTP Issuer, which can then be distributed to, and used by, us. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Borrowers distributed excess cash to us of $715.7 million and the GTP Issuers have distributed excess cash to us of $164.1 million. In order to distribute this excess cash flow to us, the Borrowers and the GTP Issuers must maintain a specified debt service coverage ratio (“DSCR”), calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the Loan Agreement or the applicable GTP Indenture) to the amount of interest required to be paid over the succeeding twelve months on the principal amount of the Loan or the principal amount of the GTP Notes that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination, plus the amounts payable for trustee and servicing fees. If the DSCR with respect to the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-1A and Series 2013-2A issued in our Securitization (the “Securities”) or any series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Partners is equal to or below 1.30x (the “Cash Trap DSCR”) at the end of any calendar quarter and it continues for two consecutive calendar quarters, or if the DSCR with respect to any series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Cellular Sites is equal to or below the Cash Trap DSCR at the end of any calendar month and it continues for two consecutive calendar months, then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required with respect to the particular series of Securities or GTP Notes under the Loan Agreement or GTP Indentures, as applicable, will be deposited into reserve accounts instead of being released to the Borrowers or the GTP Issuers. The funds in the reserve accounts will not be released to the Borrowers or GTP Partners for distribution to us unless the DSCR with respect to such series of Securities or GTP Notes exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. Likewise, the funds in the reserve account will not be released to GTP Cellular Sites for distribution to us unless the DSCR with respect to such series of GTP Notes exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar months. 58 Table of Contents Additionally, an “amortization period,” commences as of the end of any calendar quarter with respect to the Securities and the series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Partners, and as of the end of any calendar month with respect to the series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Cellular Sites, if the DSCR of such series equals or falls below 1.15x (the “Minimum DSCR”). The “amortization period” will continue to exist until the end of any calendar quarter with respect to the Securities and the series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Partners for which the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. Similarly, the “amortization period” will continue to exist until the end of any calendar month with respect to the series of GTP Notes issued by GTP Cellular Sites, for which the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar months. If on the anticipated repayment date, the outstanding principal amount with respect to any series of the GTP Notes or the component of the Loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of the Securities has not been paid in full, an “amortization period” will continue until such principal amount of the applicable series of GTP Notes or the component of the Loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of Securities is repaid in full. During an amortization period, all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve accounts because the Cash Trap DSCR was not met would be applied to pay principal of the applicable subclass of Securities or series of GTP Notes on each monthly payment date, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Further, additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any subclass of the Securities or series of GTP Notes from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the Loan Agreement or the GTP Indentures, as applicable. Consequently, a failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent the Borrowers or GTP Issuers from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions, meet REIT distribution requirements, make Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock dividend payments and fund our stock repurchase program. If the Borrowers were to default on the Loan, the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the 5,195 wireless and broadcast communications towers that secure the Loan (the “Secured Towers”), in which case we could lose the Secured Towers and the revenue associated with those towers. In addition, upon occurrence and during an event of default, the trustee may, in its discretion or at direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of GTP Notes, declare such series of GTP Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such GTP Notes. Furthermore, if the GTP Issuers were to default on a series of the GTP Notes, the trustee may demand, collect, take possession of, receive, settle, compromise, adjust, sue for, foreclose or realize upon all or any portion of the 2,845 towers and 1,035 property interests and other related assets that secure the GTP Notes (the “GTP Secured Sites”) securing such series of the GTP Notes, in which case we could lose the GTP Secured Sites and the revenue associated with those assets. As of December 31, 2014, the Borrowers’ DSCR was 10.22x. Based on the Borrowers’ net cash flow for the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2014 and the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the Loan, the Borrowers could endure a reduction of approximately $428.6 million in net cash flow before triggering the Cash Trap DSCR, and approximately $435.8 million in net cash flow before triggering the Minimum DSCR. As of December 31, 2014, the DSCR of GTP Partners and GTP Cellular Sites were 2.88x and 2.54x, respectively. Based on the net cash flow of GTP Partners and GTP Cellular Sites for the calendar quarter ended December 31, 2014 and the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the applicable series of GTP Notes, GTP Partners and GTP Cellular Sites could endure a reduction of approximately $68.7 million and $16.4 million, respectively, in net cash flow before triggering the Cash Trap DSCR, and approximately $75.2 million and $18.4 million, respectively, in net cash flow before triggering the Minimum DSCR. As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness. In addition, in order to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and satisfy our REIT distribution requirements, we may need to raise additional capital 59 Table of Contents through financing activities. If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements, pay Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock dividends or refinance our existing indebtedness. In addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and, consequently, a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2014. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. • Impairment of Assets—Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization: We review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable. We review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements. We review our customer-related intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts, or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the customer-related intangible assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment. • Impairment of Assets—Goodwill: We review goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. 60 Table of Contents Goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. We utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment and we employ a discounted cash flow analysis. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. Under the first step of this test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, we conduct the second step of this test, in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess. During the year ended December 31, 2014, no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test. The fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount by a substantial margin. • Asset Retirement Obligations: When required, we recognize the fair value of obligations to remove our tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of our tower assets are located. Generally, the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. We updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of $13.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The change in 2014 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion in the consolidated statements of operations. The significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary. • Acquisitions: For those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, we apply the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with those of the Company from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We continue to evaluate acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future customer cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition. • Revenue Recognition: Our revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is reasonably assured. Escalation clauses tied to the Consumer Price Index or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our 61 Table of Contents tenants are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total rental and management straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 approximated $123.7 million, $147.7 million and $165.8 million, respectively. Amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases. Amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met. We derive the largest portion of our revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, and approximately 56% of our revenues are derived from four tenants in the industry. In addition, we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. We mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of our borrowers and tenants. In recognizing customer revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense. Accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured. • Rent Expense: Many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time. In addition, certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. We calculate straight-line ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. • Stock-Based Compensation: The stock-based compensation expense recognized over the service period, which is generally the vesting period, is required to include an estimate of the awards that will not fully vest and be forfeited. The fair value of a stock option is determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that takes into account a number of assumptions at the accounting measurement date including the stock price, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock, the expected distributions, and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. These assumptions are highly subjective and could significantly impact the value of the option and the compensation expense. The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. We recognize stock-based compensation in either selling, general, administrative and development expense, costs of operations or as part of the costs associated with the construction of our tower assets. • Income Taxes: Accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes. To the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes, deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns, which may differ from the current rate. We do not expect to pay federal taxes on our REIT taxable income. We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be 62 Table of Contents realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes, if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability. We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination, which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit. We consider the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. Should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, we may have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside of the United States. Accounting Standards Update For a discussion of recent accounting standards updates, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. 63 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following table provides information as of December 31, 2014 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates.

(b) Variable rate debt included the 2013 Term Loan ($1.5 billion), which matures on January 3, 2019 and the 2014 Credit Facility ($1.1 billion), which matures on January 31, 2020. Variable rate debt also included $118.7 million of indebtedness under the BR Towers Debentures, which amortize through October 15, 2023, and $7.6 million of indebtedness under Sublimit A and Sublimit C under the BR Towers Credit Facility, which amortize through July 15, 2020, $263.4 million of indebtedness under the Mexican Loan, which matures on May 1, 2015, $69.0 million of indebtedness under the Uganda loan, which matures on June 29, 2019, $75.1 million of indebtedness outstanding under the South African Facility, which amortizes through March 31, 2020 and $83.6 million of indebtedness under the Colombian Credit Facility, which amortizes through April 24, 2021. Interest on the 2013 Credit Facility, the 2013 Term Loan and the 2014 Credit Facility is payable in accordance with the applicable LIBOR agreement or quarterly and accrues at our option either at LIBOR plus margin (as defined) or the base rate plus margin (as defined). The interest rate in effect at December 31, 2014 for both the 2013 Term Loan and the 2014 Credit Facility was 1.41%. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the weighted average interest rate under the 2013 Credit Facility, the 2014 Credit Facility and the 2013 Term Loan was 1.43%. The BR Towers Debentures bear interest at a rate of 7.40%, and any increase in the aggregate principal amount relative to changes in the National Extended Consumer Price Index will be capitalized pursuant to the Debenture Agreement. Interest on Sublimit A and Sublimit C under the BR Towers Credit Facility is payable in accordance with the Long-Term Interest Rate disclosed by the Central Bank of Brazil plus margin (as defined), which resulted in an interest rate of 10.80% and 5.90%, respectively, at December 31, 2014. Interest on the Mexican Loan is payable in accordance with the applicable TIIE plus margin (as defined). The Mexican Loan accrued interest at 4.82% at December 31, 2014. Interest on the Uganda loan is payable in accordance with the applicable LIBOR plus margin (as defined). The Uganda loan accrued interest at 5.84% at December 31, 2014. Interest on the South African Facility is payable in accordance with the applicable Johannesburg Interbank Agreed Rate (“JIBAR”) agreement and accrues at JIBAR plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2014, after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements in South Africa, was 10.34%. Interest on the Colombian Credit Facility is payable in accordance with the applicable Inter-bank Rate (“IBR”) agreement and accrues at IBR plus margin (as defined). The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2014, after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreement in Colombia, was 9.05%. (c) Based on rates effective as of December 31, 2014. (d) Represents the weighted average fixed rate of interest based on contractual notional amount as a percentage of total notional amounts. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to variability in interest rates on debt in Colombia and South Africa. In connection with entering into the Colombian Credit Facility in October 64 Table of Contents 2014, we terminated our pre-existing interest rate swap agreement and entered into a new interest rate swap agreement with an aggregate notional value of 100.0 billion COP (approximately $41.8 million). All of our interest rate swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges and have an aggregate notional amount of $79.9 million, interest rates ranging from 5.74% to 7.83% and expiration dates through April 2021. Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2014, was comprised of $1,500.0 million under the 2013 Term Loan, $1,100.0 million under the 2014 Credit Facility, $263.4 million under the Mexican Loan, $118.7 million under the BR Towers Debentures, $69.0 million under the Uganda loan, $37.1 million under the South African Facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements, $41.8 million under the Colombian Credit Facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements and $7.6 million under Sublimit A and Sublimit C under the BR Towers Credit Facility. A 10% increase in current interest rates would result in an additional $7.0 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014. We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar is reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of AOCI. We may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions in order to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations. For the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 33% of our revenues and approximately 39% of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate by approximately 3%. As of December 31, 2014, we have incurred intercompany debt, which is not considered to be permanently reinvested, and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As this debt had not been designated as being of long-term investment in nature, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. An adverse change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in approximately $18.5 million of unrealized gains or losses that would be included in Other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.",2023-12-30 19:23:25.900248
