63908,MCD,MCDONALDS CORP,2013,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OverviewDESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESSThe Company franchises and operates McDonald’s restaurants. Of the 34,480 restaurants in 119 countries at year-end 2012, 27,882 were franchised or licensed (including 19,869 franchised to conventional franchisees, 4,350 licensed to developmental licensees and 3,663 licensed to foreign affiliates (""affiliates"")—primarily Japan) and 6,598 were operated by the Company. Under our conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and décor of their restaurant business, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants. Under our developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market.We view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is important to delivering great, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. However, directly operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. In our Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. We continually review, and as appropriate adjust, our mix of Company-operated and franchised or licensed (conventional franchised, developmental licensed and foreign affiliated) restaurants to help optimize overall performance.The Company’s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms.The business is managed as distinct geographic segments. Significant reportable segments include the United States (""U.S.""), Europe, and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (""APMEA""). In addition, throughout this report we present “Other Countries & Corporate” that includes operations in Canada and Latin America, as well as Corporate activities. The U.S., Europe and APMEA segments account for 32%, 39% and 23% of total revenues, respectively. The United Kingdom (""U.K.""), France and Germany, collectively, account for 51% of Europe’s revenues; and China, Australia and Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), collectively, account for 56% of APMEA’s revenues. These six markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as “major markets” throughout this report and comprise 70% of total revenues.In analyzing business trends, management considers a variety of performance and financial measures, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth and returns.▪Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because we believe this better represents the Company’s underlying business trends.▪Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the Company’s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. Generally, the goal is to achieve a balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check.McDonald’s reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays and weekend days in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts. The Company refers to these impacts as calendar shift/trading day adjustments. In addition, the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts. These impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have the greatest effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal.▪Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company’s financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.▪Return on incremental invested capital (""ROIIC"") is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation.STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEThe strength of the alignment between the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the ""System"") has been key to McDonald's success. This business model enables McDonald's to consistently deliver locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve. In addition, it facilitates our ability to identify, implement and scale innovative ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. 10 McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual ReportMcDonald's customer-focused Plan to Win (""Plan"") provides a common framework for our global business while allowing for local adaptation. Through the execution of multiple initiatives surrounding the five pillars of our Plan—People, Products, Place, Price and Promotion—we have enhanced the restaurant experience for customers worldwide and grown global comparable sales and guest counts in each of the last nine years. This Plan, combined with financial discipline, has delivered strong results for our shareholders since its inception. To measure our performance as we continue to build the business, we have the following long-term, average annual constant currency financial targets:▪Systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5%; ▪Operating income growth of 6% to 7%;▪ROIIC in the high teens. Prior to 2012, we exceeded each of these financial targets every year since the Plan's implementation in 2003, after adjusting for the loss in 2007 from the Latin America developmental license transaction. These targets have enabled us to make the best decisions for the long-term benefit of our shareholders, and we believe they remain realistic and sustainable for a company of our size.In 2012, Systemwide sales growth was 3% (5% in constant currencies), operating income growth was 1% (4% in constant currencies), one-year ROIIC was 15.4% and three-year ROIIC was 28.6% (see reconciliation on page 24). Persistent global economic headwinds, heightened competitive activity and inflationary costs impacted results. In addition, planned strategic decisions, such as the 2012 London Olympics sponsorship, investing in technology and the biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator convention, also impacted results. In 2012, we continued to focus on customers' needs and remained aligned on our Plan and the three global growth priorities of optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience, and broadening accessibility to our brand. We believe these priorities are relevant and actionable, and combined with our competitive advantages, will drive long-term sustainable growth. Initiatives supporting these priorities resonated with customers and drove increases in global comparable sales and guest counts of 3.1% and 1.6%, respectively, despite challenging economies and a relatively flat or declining Informal Eating Out (""IEO"") segment in most markets. In 2012, we continued to grow market share in the U.S., Europe and APMEA, amid a more competitive global environment and a slight decline in our fourth quarter comparable guest counts.Comparable sales are impacted by guest counts, product mix shifts and menu pricing. Specific menu pricing actions across our system reflect local market conditions as well as other factors, notably food away from home and food at home inflation indices. In our Company-operated restaurants, we manage menu board prices to ensure value at all price points, increase profitability and mitigate inflation, all while trying to grow guest counts. In order to accomplish these objectives, we utilize a strategic pricing tool that balances price and product mix. Franchisees also have access to, and many utilize, this strategic pricing tool. In general, we believe franchisees employ a similar pricing strategy. We look to optimize product mix by utilizing a menu with entry-point value, core, premium and promotional offerings. We also introduce new products to meet customers' needs, which can expand average check and increase guest counts. In 2012, average prices increased at Company-operated restaurants in each area of the world, although increases varied by market and region.U.S.In the U.S., comparable sales increased for the tenth consecutive year, rising 3.3% in 2012, while comparable guest counts rose 1.9%. These results were achieved despite only modest growth in the IEO segment and heightened competitive activity. In the second half of the year, we experienced softer performance; therefore, we adjusted our plans to re-energize our all-day everyday value offerings while providing the menu variety customers expect from McDonald's. In 2012, we continued to highlight beverages, value, breakfast, and our classic core favorites. We expanded our McCafé beverage offerings with the Chocolate Chip Frappé and Cherry Berry Chiller. Limited-time offers, such as Chicken McBites and the Cheddar Bacon Onion premium sandwiches, complemented our core menu offerings.Modernizing the customer experience continued through our major remodeling initiative, which provides contemporary restaurant designs and retailing efforts. The enhanced appearance and functionality of our restaurants deliver a more relevant experience for our customers. Over 900 existing restaurants were remodeled during 2012 with the majority adding drive-thru capacity to capture additional guest counts. We broadened the accessibility of our convenient locations through extended hours and efficient drive-thru service. More than half of our restaurants use some form of multiple order points to maximize drive-thru capacity, including 1,500 with hand-held order takers to help improve customer service times. To further build on our competitive advantage, we focused on operations excellence initiatives to drive customer satisfaction as we strive to deliver fast, accurate and friendly service with every order.EuropeIn Europe, comparable sales rose 2.4%, marking the ninth consecutive year of comparable sales increases, while guest counts declined 0.5%. While low consumer confidence continues to negatively affect overall retail sales and the IEO segment, we outperformed the market and grew market share. Major contributors to comparable sales were the U.K. and Russia. Despite ongoing economic challenges, the segment's priority remains growing the overall business by balancing a strong focus on our unique value offerings, ongoing premium product innovation, and new products. Europe continued to see the benefit of providing a relevant, contemporary customer experience and completed almost 750 restaurant reimages. By the end of 2012, over 90% of restaurant interiors and approximately 50% of exteriors had been reimaged. Europe also invested in a roll-out of a new point-of-sale system, which allows us to continue to expand our menu offerings and improve order accuracy. By the end of 2012, over 2,200 restaurants had deployed this system.We expanded our coffee business and have over 1,600 McCafé locations, which in Europe are generally separate areas inside the restaurants that serve specialty coffees, desserts and snacks. In addition, we increased our accessibility and convenience with extended operating hours, self-order kiosks, optimized drive-thrus, and opened over 250 new restaurants. APMEAIn APMEA, comparable sales rose 1.4% and comparable guest counts rose 2.2%, despite a challenging year of economic pressures, partly due to Japan's uneven recovery and China's slower economic growth. Positive performance was driven by China, Australia and many other markets. Unique value platforms, great tasting premium menu selections, locally-relevant menu variety, and convenience and service enhancements differentiated the McDonald's experience. Australia launched the “Loose Change Menu,” which is a branded affordability menu, while China focused on breakfast, lunch, and dinner value platforms. Value initiatives were balanced with mid-tier offers, such as Bubble Tea in China, and premium limited-time offers, such as the Serious Lamb Burger and Wrap in Australia. McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report 11Our breakfast business has expanded and is offered in approximately 75% of APMEA restaurants. Desserts continued to play a meaningful role, particularly in China, where we remain one of the largest ice cream retailers. We opened over 750 new restaurants in APMEA, of which over 250 were in China, where we have made significant progress toward our goal of 2,000 restaurants by the end of 2013. Nearly two-thirds of APMEA restaurants are offering some form of extended operating hours and over 5,400 restaurants are open 24 hours. Delivery is offered in many APMEA markets and is now available in over 1,700 restaurants, including nearly 550 in China. Since Japan's natural disaster in March of 2011, the economy remains a challenge. Despite a declining IEO segment, McDonald's is gaining market share through a value platform of 100, 250, and 500 YEN offerings, and family sharing boxes, such as 15-piece Chicken McNuggets. Japan augmented its value platform with strategic couponing to encourage add-on and Extra Value Meal purchases.ConsolidatedGlobally, our approach to offering affordable value to our customers is complemented by a focus on driving operating efficiencies and leveraging our scale, supply chain infrastructure and our suppliers' risk management practices to manage costs. We were able to execute our strategies in every area of the world, grow comparable sales and control selling, general and administrative expenses. However, in 2012 we faced top- and bottom-line pressures, some a result of planned strategic decisions, and others driven by the external environment. As a result, combined operating margin (operating income as a percent of total revenues) was 31.2% in 2012, down 0.4 percentage points as compared to 2011. In 2012, cash from operations was nearly $7.0 billion. Our substantial cash flow, strong credit rating and continued access to credit provide us flexibility to fund capital expenditures as well as return cash to shareholders. Capital expenditures of approximately $3.0 billion were invested in our business primarily to reimage existing restaurants and open new restaurants. Across the System, over 1,400 restaurants were opened and about 2,400 existing locations were reimaged. In addition, we returned $5.5 billion to shareholders consisting of $2.9 billion in dividends and $2.6 billion in share repurchases. Cash from operations continues to benefit from our heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income received from owner/operators is a stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs. In addition, the franchise business model is less capital intensive than the Company-owned model. We believe locally-owned and operated restaurants maximize brand performance and are at the core of our competitive advantages, making McDonald's not just a global brand but also a locally– relevant one.HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE YEAR INCLUDED:▪Comparable sales grew 3.1% and guest counts rose 1.6%, building on 2011 increases of 5.6% and 3.7%, respectively.▪Revenues increased 2% (5% in constant currencies).▪Operating income increased 1% (4% in constant currencies).▪Diluted earnings per share was $5.36, an increase of 2% (5% in constant currencies).▪Cash provided by operations was nearly $7.0 billion.▪One-year ROIIC was 15.4% and three-year ROIIC was 28.6% for the period ended December 31, 2012. ▪The Company increased the quarterly cash dividend per share 10% to $0.77 for the fourth quarter—bringing our current annual dividend to $3.08 per share. ▪The Company returned $5.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.OUTLOOK FOR 2013 We will continue to build the business in 2013 and beyond by enhancing the customer experience across all pillars of our Plan and our three global growth priorities to optimize our menu, modernize the customer experience and broaden accessibility to our brand. We remain focused on seizing the long-term opportunities in the $1 trillion IEO segment by leveraging our competitive advantages. We have a brand advantage in convenience, menu variety and value, a resilient business model, and the experience and alignment throughout the McDonald's System to navigate the current environment.Our number one priority continues to be satisfying our customers' needs by serving great-tasting, high-quality food in contemporary restaurants. This focus on our customers is particularly critical in this uncertain environment, where ongoing volatility continues to negatively impact consumer sentiment and spending. We anticipate a continued flat to declining IEO segment in many of the markets where we operate. Growing market share will remain our focus to attain sustainable and profitable long-term growth. We will highlight promotions of our core menu favorites, while strategically expanding our menu with relevant new offerings across all dayparts, including premium products that can deliver a higher average check. We will place an even greater emphasis on scaling success quickly around the globe. For example, in many markets we will expand our innovative McBites line-up, introduce existing products like our blended ice beverages and large McWraps into new markets, and offer even more of the unique, flavor-based promotional food events that have been successful. We will emphasize our dayparts—like breakfast and extended hours—that are still growing globally in both established and emerging markets. We will enhance the customer experience by continuing to reimage our building interiors and exteriors and by providing our restaurant teams with the appropriate tools, training, and technology. The accessibility efforts will include increasing the level and variety of conveniences provided to our customers through new restaurant openings, extended operating hours, stronger value platforms, and faster, more accurate service through innovative order taking. With operational and financial discipline, we will execute these priorities to increase McDonald's brand relevance.We will continue to build customer trust through our commitment to sustainability—including nutrition and well-being, a sustainable supply chain, environmental responsibility, employee experience, and the community. U.S.In 2013, the U.S. business will focus on driving sales and guest counts by enhancing the entire customer experience through the pillars of the Plan and the three global priorities. Our menu pipeline is more balanced in 2013, with a continued focus on great taste, quality ingredients and variety. We will satisfy our customers' needs with the food they crave by balancing core favorites with limited time offers and innovative new products across the menu. Menu news will be augmented with brand messages that highlight our quality food ingredients, efforts around promoting children's well-being and community involvement. We will enhance our Dollar Menu and introduce new products to highlight McDonald's value at every price point, across all menu categories. We are continuing our major remodel program by updating about 800 locations in 2013. At the same time, we are continuing to improve 12 McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Reportrestaurant operations through appropriate staffing and a focus on friendly, accurate service as well as innovative order taking. In addition, we will increase the number of restaurants that operate 24 hours a day and strive to be our customers' favorite eating-out destination. EuropeIn Europe, we see growth opportunities in breakfast, core menu items, beverages, and extended hours. Our business plans are focused on building market share by emphasizing value across all dayparts and new restaurant growth. In some markets, our value offerings will evolve from a low-end entry price to multiple entry prices across our menu. This value menu evolution is intended to grow guest counts with compelling affordability and enhanced trade-up opportunities through an extended range of options. In 2013, we will reimage approximately 450 restaurants as we progress towards our goal of having 100% of our interiors and over 85% of our exteriors reimaged by the end of 2015. We will also open nearly 300 restaurants. We will leverage production and service enhancements by optimizing kitchen platforms and accelerating the deployment of technologies, such as updating the point-of-sale system and rolling out multiple order points via self-order kiosks, hand-held order devices and side-by-side drive-thrus. These initiatives will enhance the customer experience, help drive guest counts and improve labor efficiency. We will also continue to reduce our impact on the environment with energy management tools. Despite the near-term headwinds due to economic uncertainty and government-initiated austerity measures implemented in many countries, Europe offers significant long-term opportunity, and we are well-positioned to capitalize on this segment's potential. APMEAIn APMEA, we will advance efforts to become our customers' favorite place and way to eat and drink by reinvigorating our long-term value platforms, accelerating growth at breakfast, and focusing on menu variety and convenience. Value will continue to be a key strategy and growth driver to build traffic with a focus across the menu at all dayparts, combined with trade-up strategies to build average check. For example, Australia will evolve its Loose Change Menu, and Japan will focus on building average check through trade-up opportunities with promotional products and a focus on breakfast. We plan to grow breakfast traffic in APMEA through increased marketing efforts, value, accessibility and operations excellence. The markets will continue to balance core and limited-time offers and will execute a series of exciting food events that celebrate our core menu and the segment's all-time favorite product offerings. At the same time, we will continue to leverage the diversity of the segment to identify and scale new products and platforms. Convenience initiatives will focus on optimizing our drive-thru and delivery services through operation efficiencies and online capabilities. In China, for example, a new web-ordering system will enhance the customer experience and drive new demand through delivery. We will grow our business by opening approximately 850 new restaurants and reimaging about 225 existing restaurants while elevating our focus on service and operations. In China, we will continue to build a foundation for long-term growth by opening over 300 restaurants, consistent with our goal of reaching 2,000 restaurants by the end of 2013.ConsolidatedGlobally, we will maintain financial discipline by effectively managing spending. In making capital allocation decisions, our goal is to make investments that elevate the McDonald's experience and drive sustainable growth in sales and market share. We focus on markets that generate acceptable returns or have opportunities for long-term growth. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures) to shareholders over the long-term via dividends and share repurchases. McDonald's does not provide specific guidance on diluted earnings per share. The following information is provided to assist in analyzing the Company's results: ▪Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 2.5 percentage points to 2013 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies), most of which will be due to the 1,135 net traditional restaurants added in 2012. ▪The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point increase in comparable sales for either the U.S. or Europe would increase annual diluted earnings per share by about 4 cents. ▪With about 75% of McDonald's grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Company's commodity costs. For the full year 2013, the total basket of goods cost is expected to increase 1.5-2.5% in the U.S. and 3-4% in Europe. ▪The Company expects full-year 2013 selling, general and administrative expenses to increase approximately 2-3% in constant currencies, with fluctuations expected between the quarters. ▪Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full year 2013 to increase approximately 4-6% compared with 2012. ▪A significant part of the Company's operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 35% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 65% of the Company's operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Company's annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 25 cents.▪The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2013 to be 31% to 33%. Some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate that is outside the annual range. As a result of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, our income tax provision for the first quarter of 2013 will include a tax benefit of about $50 million reflecting the retroactive impact of certain tax benefits, which may result in a first quarter effective tax rate below the full year range. ▪The Company expects capital expenditures for 2013 to be approximately $3.2 billion. Over half of this amount will be used to open new restaurants. The Company expects to open between 1,500 - 1,600 restaurants including about 500 restaurants in affiliated and developmental licensee markets, such as Japan and Latin America, where the Company does not fund any capital expenditures. The Company expects net additions of between 1,200 - 1,300 traditional restaurants. The remaining capital will be used to reinvest in existing locations, in part through reimaging. More than 1,600 restaurants worldwide are expected to be reimaged, including locations in affiliated and developmental licensee markets that require no capital investment from the Company.

In 2011, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results driven by the stronger Euro and Australian Dollar, as well as most other currencies. In 2010, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results driven by stronger global currencies, primarily the Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, partly offset by the weaker Euro.

Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.17 per share on diluted earnings per share. Net income and diluted earnings per share growth in constant currencies were positively impacted by growth in franchised margin dollars, partly offset by a higher effective income tax rate and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. A decrease of 2% in diluted weighted average shares outstanding also contributed to the diluted earnings per share growth in 2012.In 2011, net income increased 11% (7% in constant currencies) to $5.5 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased 15% (11% in constant currencies) to $5.27. Foreign currency translation had a positive impact of $0.19 per share on diluted earnings per share. Net income and diluted earnings per share growth in 2011 in constant currencies were positively impacted by growth in franchised margin dollars, and to a lesser extent, Company-operated margin dollars, partly offset by a higher effective income tax rate. A decrease of 3% in diluted weighted average shares outstanding also contributed to the diluted earnings per share growth in 2011. The Company repurchased 28.1 million shares of its stock for $2.6 billion in 2012 and 41.9 million shares of its stock for $3.4 billion in 2011, driving reductions in weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods. REVENUESThe Company’s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees.In 2012 and 2011, constant currency revenue growth was driven primarily by positive comparable sales as well as expansion.Revenues Amount Increase/(decrease) Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation Dollars in millions 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2012 2011Company-operated sales: U.S. $4,530 $4,433 $4,229 2% 5% 2% 5%Europe 7,850 7,852 6,932 0 13 6 8APMEA 5,350 5,061 4,297 6 18 5 11Other Countries & Corporate 873 947 775 (8) 22 (7) 17Total $18,603 $18,293 $16,233 2% 13% 4% 8%Franchised revenues: U.S. $4,284 $4,096 $3,883 5% 5% 5% 5%Europe 2,977 3,034 2,637 (2) 15 5 9APMEA 1,041 958 769 9 25 9 14Other Countries & Corporate 662 625 553 6 13 11 8Total $8,964 $8,713 $7,842 3% 11% 6% 8%Total revenues: U.S. $8,814 $8,529 $8,112 3% 5% 3% 5%Europe 10,827 10,886 9,569 (1) 14 6 8APMEA 6,391 6,019 5,066 6 19 6 11Other Countries & Corporate 1,535 1,572 1,328 (2) 18 0 14Total $27,567 $27,006 $24,075 2% 12% 5% 8% In the U.S., the increase in revenues in 2012 was primarily due to positive comparable sales. Everyday value offerings, menu variety and the enhanced customer experience due to reimaging contributed positively to results, despite broad competitive activity. Revenues in 2011 were positively impacted by the ongoing appeal of our iconic core products and the success of new products, including additions to the McCafé beverage line, as well as continued focus on everyday value, convenience and modernizing the customer experience.Europe’s constant currency increases in revenues in 2012 and 2011 were primarily driven by positive comparable sales in the U.K. and Russia, the segment's two largest Company-operated restaurant markets, as well as expansion in Russia. Revenues in 2011 also benefited from comparable sales increases in France and Germany. In APMEA, the constant currency increase in revenues in 2012 was driven by positive comparable sales in China, Australia and many other markets. The constant currency increase in revenues in 2011 was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in China and most other markets. Expansion, primarily in China, also contributed to revenue growth in both periods.

Franchised margin dollars represented about two-thirds of the combined restaurant margins in 2012, 2011 and 2010. Franchised margin dollars increased $205 million or 3% (6% in constant currencies) in 2012 and $768 million or 12% (9% in constant currencies) in 2011. Positive comparable sales were the primary driver of the constant currency growth in franchised margin dollars in both years.

The increase in 2011 was primarily due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher occupancy expenses.In Europe, the franchised margin percent decrease in 2012 reflected positive comparable sales and higher occupancy costs. The increase in 2011 was primarily due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher occupancy expenses. 16 McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual ReportIn APMEA, the franchised margin percent decrease in 2012 was primarily due to Australia, which was partly impacted by the 2012 change in classification of certain amounts from revenues to restaurant occupancy expenses. Although the change in classification resulted in a decrease to the franchised margin percentage, there was no impact on the reported franchised margin dollars. The increase in 2011 was primarily due to a contractual escalation in the royalty rate for Japan in addition to positive comparable sales in most markets, partly offset by a negative impact from the strengthening of the Australian dollar. The franchised margin percent in APMEA and Other Countries & Corporate is higher relative to the U.S. and Europe due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed and/or affiliated restaurants where the Company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs.▪Company-operated marginsCompany-operated margin dollars represent sales by Company-operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. Company-operated margin dollars decreased $76 million or 2% (increased 1% in constant currencies) in 2012, and increased $282 million or 9% (5% in constant currencies) in 2011. In 2012, Company-operated margin dollars were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation of $97 million, primarily in Europe. On a constant currency basis, the increase in Company-operated margin dollars was due to positive performance in Europe, offset by lower results in APMEA and the U.S. as positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher costs. The growth in Company-operated margin dollars in 2011 was driven by positive comparable sales partly offset by higher costs, primarily commodity costs, in all segments. Foreign currency translation also had a positive impact on results.Company-operated marginsIn millions2012 2011 2010U.S.$883 $914 $902Europe1,501 1,514 1,373APMEA849 876 764Other Countries & Corporate146 151 134Total$3,379 $3,455 $3,173 Percent of sales U.S.19.5% 20.6% 21.3%Europe19.1 19.3 19.8APMEA15.9 17.3 17.8Other Countries & Corporate16.8 16.0 17.2Total18.2% 18.9% 19.6%In the U.S., the Company-operated margin percent decreased in 2012 primarily due to higher commodity and labor costs, partly offset by positive comparable sales. The margin percent decreased in 2011 due to higher commodity and occupancy costs, partly offset by positive comparable sales. Europe’s Company-operated margin percent decreased in 2012 primarily due to higher labor and commodity costs across several markets, despite positive comparable sales in Russia and the U.K. The margin percent decreased in 2011 as higher commodity, labor, and occupancy costs were partly offset by positive comparable sales. In APMEA, the Company-operated margin percent in 2012 decreased primarily due to higher labor and occupancy costs, partly offset by positive comparable sales. The margin percent decreased in 2011 as higher commodity, labor and occupancy costs were partly offset by positive comparable sales. Acceleration of new restaurant openings in China negatively impacted the margin percent in both periods. Similar to other markets, new restaurants in China initially open with lower margins that grow significantly over time. Supplemental information regarding Company-operated restaurantsWe continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance, profits and returns. In most cases, franchising is the best way to achieve these goals, but as previously stated, Company-operated restaurants are also important to our success.We report results for Company-operated restaurants based on their sales, less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs. We report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues, less associated occupancy costs. For this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure, we do not specifically allocate selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating (income) expenses to Company-operated or franchised restaurants. Other operating items that relate to the Company-operated restaurants generally include gains/losses on sales of restaurant businesses and write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements.We believe the following information about Company-operated restaurants in our most significant segments provides an additional perspective on this business. Management of the Company considers this information when evaluating restaurant ownership mix, subject to other relevant considerations.The following table seeks to illustrate the two components of our Company-operated margins. The first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations, which we refer to as “Store operating margin.” The second relates to the value of our brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties. We refer to this component as “Brand/real estate margin.” Both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties, although rent and royalties for Company-operated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation. Rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales, and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of McDonald’s investment in the restaurant. Royalty rates may also vary by market.As shown in the following table, in disaggregating the components of our Company-operated margins, certain costs with respect to Company-operated restaurants are reflected in Brand/real estate margin. Those costs consist of rent payable by McDonald’s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy & other operating expenses recorded in the Consolidated statement of income. Store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses, and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating Brand/real estate margin.While we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our Company-operated business, it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In particular, as noted previously, we do not allocate selling, general and administrative expenses to our Company-operated business. However, we believe that about $50,000 per restaurant, on average, is the typical cost to support this business in the U.S. The actual costs in markets outside theU.S. will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market. These costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant.

This adjustment is made to reflect expense in Store operating margin and income in Brand/real estate margin. Countries within Europe have varying economic profiles and a wide range of rent and royalty rates as a percentage of sales. SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSESConsolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3% (4% in constant currencies) in 2012 and increased 3% (flat in constant currencies) in 2011. The growth rate for 2012 was primarily due to higher employee costs, the 2012 London Olympics sponsorship, higher technology related costs and the 2012 Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention, partly offset by lower incentive-based compensation. The growth rate for 2011 was flat as higher employee and other costs were offset by lower incentive-based compensation and costs in 2010 related to the Vancouver Olympics and the Company’s 2010 Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales were 2.8% in 2012 and 2011, and 3.0% in 2010. Management believes that analyzing selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales, as well as revenues, is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support the overall McDonald's business.18 McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual ReportIMPAIRMENT AND OTHER CHARGES (CREDITS), NETImpairment and other charges (credits), netIn millions2012 2011 2010 Europe $7 $1APMEA $(4) 49Other Countries & Corporate 1 (21)Total $8 $(4) $29In 2010, the Company recorded expense of $29 million primarily related to its share of restaurant closing costs in McDonald’s Japan in conjunction with the strategic review of the market’s restaurant portfolio, partly offset by income related to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction.OTHER OPERATING (INCOME) EXPENSE, NETOther operating (income) expense, netIn millions2012 2011 2010Gains on sales of restaurant businesses$(152) $(82) $(79)Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates(144) (178) (164)Asset dispositions and other expense44 27 45Total$(252) $(233) $(198)▪Gains on sales of restaurant businessesGains on sales of restaurant businesses include gains from sales of Company-operated restaurants. The Company’s purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business. Gains on sales of restaurant businesses increased in 2012 due primarily to sales of restaurants in China to developmental licensees, as well as sales of restaurants in Europe and Canada. ▪Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliatesUnconsolidated affiliates and partnerships are businesses in which the Company actively participates, but does not control. The Company records equity in earnings from these entities representing McDonald’s share of results. For foreign affiliated markets—primarily Japan—results are reported after interest expense and income taxes. McDonald’s share of results for partnerships in certain consolidated markets such as the U.S. is reported before income taxes. These partnership restaurants are operated under conventional franchise arrangements and, therefore, are classified as conventional franchised restaurants. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased in 2012 due to lower operating results, primarily in Japan. Results in 2011 reflected a benefit from stronger foreign currencies, partly offset by the decline in the number of unconsolidated partnerships in the U.S. ▪Asset dispositions and other expenseAsset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for restaurant closings and uncollectible receivables, asset write-offs due to restaurant reinvestment, and other miscellaneous income and expenses. Asset dispositions and other expense increased in 2012 primarily due to lower gains on unconsolidated partnership dissolutions in the U.S. Results in 2011 reflected higher gains on unconsolidated partnership dissolutions in the U.S. OPERATING INCOMEOperating income Amount Increase/(decrease) Increase excluding currency translation Dollars in millions2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2012 2011U.S.$3,751 $3,666 $3,446 2% 6% 2% 6%Europe3,196 3,227 2,797 (1) 15 6 10APMEA1,566 1,526 1,200 3 27 3 17Other Countries & Corporate92 111 30 (17) nm 9 nmTotal$8,605 $8,530 $7,473 1% 14% 4% 10%nm Not meaningfulIn the U.S., results for 2012 increased due to higher franchised margin dollars, partly offset by lower other operating income and Company-operated margin dollars. Results for 2011 increased primarily due to higher combined restaurant margin dollars, mostly from franchised margin dollars.In Europe, results for 2012 were driven by strong operating performance in Russia and the U.K. The segment's constant currency operating results benefited from higher franchised margin dollars, and to a lesser extent, Company-operated margin dollars. These results also benefited from higher gains on sales of restaurants, primarily in France and Germany, partly offset by incremental selling, general and administrative expenses related to the 2012 London Olympics. Results for 2011 were driven by stronger operating performance in France, the U.K., Russia and Germany, and higher combined restaurant margin dollars, primarily franchised margin dollars. In APMEA, results for 2012 increased primarily due to higher franchised margin dollars and gains on sales of restaurants in China to developmental licensees, partly offset by lower Company-operated margin dollars and lower operating results in Japan. Results for 2011 increased due to stronger operating results in many markets. Impairment charges in 2010 also positively impacted the constant currency growth rate for 2011 by 4 percentage points. ▪Combined operating marginCombined operating margin is defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues. Combined operating margin for 2012, 2011 and 2010 was 31.2%, 31.6% and 31.0%, respectively. McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report 19INTEREST EXPENSEInterest expense increased 5% and 9% in 2012 and 2011, respectively, primarily due to higher average debt balances, partly offset by lower average interest rates.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXESIn 2012, 2011 and 2010, the reported effective income tax rates were 32.4%, 31.3% and 29.3%, respectively.In 2012, the effective income tax rate reflected the negative impact of certain tax benefits in the U.S. that had expired at December 31, 2011. In January 2013, the United States enacted the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (""Act""). The Act reinstated, retroactive to January 1, 2012, certain tax benefits that had previously expired. However, in accordance with the financial accounting standards for income taxes, the Company is required to account for the effects of changes in tax laws in the period the legislation is enacted. In 2011, the effective income tax rate reflected lower tax benefits related to certain foreign tax credits, partially offset by nonrecurring deferred tax benefits related to certain foreign operations.Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.5 billion in 2012 and 2011. Substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the U.S. and other profitable markets.ACCOUNTING CHANGES▪Fair value measurementsIn May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued an update to Topic 820 – Fair Value Measurement of the Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC""). This update provides guidance on how fair value accounting should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards and does not extend the use of fair value accounting. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2012, as required, and it did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. ▪Comprehensive IncomeIn June 2011, the FASB issued an update to Topic 220 – Comprehensive Income of the ASC. The update is intended to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income in the financial statements. The guidance requires that the Company presents components of comprehensive income in either one continuous statement or two separate consecutive statements. The Company adopted this new guidance in 2012, as required, and included a separate Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in this Form 10-K. Cash Flows The Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases.Cash provided by operations totaled $7.0 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $3.9 billion in 2012, while cash provided by operations totaled $7.2 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.4 billion in 2011. In 2012, cash provided by operations decreased $184 million or 3% compared with 2011 despite increased operating results, primarily due to higher income tax payments and the negative impact of foreign currency translation on operating results. In 2011, cash provided by operations increased $808 million or 13% compared with 2010 primarily due to higher operating results.Cash used for investing activities totaled $3.2 billion in 2012, an increase of $596 million compared with 2011. The increase primarily reflected higher capital expenditures, an increase in other investing activities related to short-term time deposits, and lower proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses. Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.6 billion in 2011, an increase of $515 million compared with 2010. This reflected higher capital expenditures, partly offset by higher proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses.Cash used for financing activities totaled $3.8 billion in 2012, a decrease of $683 million compared with 2011, primarily due to lower treasury stock purchases and higher net debt issuances, partly offset by higher dividend payments. Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.5 billion in 2011, an increase of $804 million compared with 2010, primarily due to higher treasury stock purchases, higher dividend payments and lower proceeds from stock option exercises, partly offset by higher net debt issuances.The Company’s cash and equivalents balance was $2.3 billion at year end 2012 and 2011. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements.RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURESIn 2012, the Company opened 1,404 traditional restaurants and 35 satellite restaurants (small, limited-menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 269 traditional restaurants and 200 satellite restaurants. In 2011, the Company opened 1,118 traditional restaurants and 32 satellite restaurants, and closed 246 traditional restaurants and 131 satellite restaurants. The majority of restaurant openings and closings occurred in the major markets in both years. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure.Systemwide restaurants at year end(1) 2012 2011 2010U.S.14,157 14,098 14,027Europe7,368 7,156 6,969APMEA9,454 8,865 8,424Other Countries & Corporate3,501 3,391 3,317Total34,480 33,510 32,737(1)Includes satellite units at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 as follows: U.S.—997, 1,084, 1,112; Europe—246, 240, 239; APMEA (primarily Japan)—871, 949, 1,010; Other Countries & Corporate—453, 459, 470.20 McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual ReportApproximately 65% of Company-operated restaurants and over 75% of franchised restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2012. Over 80% of the restaurants at year-end 2012 were franchised.Capital expenditures increased $319 million or 12% in 2012, and increased $595 million or 28% in 2011, primarily due to higher reinvestment in existing restaurants and higher investment in new restaurants. The higher reinvestment reflects the Company's commitment to grow sales through initiatives such as reimaging in many markets around the world. The increase related to new restaurants reflects our commitment to broaden accessibility to our brand.Capital expenditures invested in major markets, excluding Japan, represented about 70% of the total in 2012, 2011 and 2010. Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts.Capital expenditures In millions2012 2011 2010New restaurants$1,340 $1,193 $968Existing restaurants1,615 1,432 1,089Other(1)94 105 78Total capital expenditures$3,049 $2,730 $2,135Total assets$35,386 $32,990 $31,975(1)Primarily corporate equipment and other office-related expenditures.New restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long-term growth. Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, and leveraging best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonald’s restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $2.9 million in 2012.The Company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2012 and 2011.SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDSFor the last three years, the Company returned a total of $16.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends.Shares repurchased and dividends In millions, except per share data2012 2011 2010Number of shares repurchased28.1 41.9 37.8Shares outstanding at year end1,003 1,021 1,054Dividends declared per share$2.87 $2.53 $2.26 Treasury stock purchases (in Shareholders' equity)$2,605 $3,373 $2,648Dividends paid2,897 2,610 2,408Total returned to shareholders$5,502 $5,983 $5,056 In September 2009, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a $10 billion share repurchase program with no specified expiration date (""2009 Program""). As most of the amount authorized under the 2009 Program was utilized, the Company’s Board of Directors terminated the 2009 Program and replaced it with a new share repurchase program, effective August 1, 2012, that authorizes the purchase of up to $10 billion of the Company’s outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date. In 2012, approximately 8.4 million shares were repurchased for $748 million under the new program. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 37 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2012 full year dividend of $2.87 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.70 per share, with an increase to $0.77 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 10% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $3.08 per share annual dividend and reflects the Company’s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors.Financial Position and Capital Resources TOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNSTotal assets increased $2.4 billion or 7% in 2012. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total assets increased $2.0 billion in 2012. Over 75% of total assets were in major markets at year-end 2012. Net property and equipment increased $1.8 billion in 2012 and represented about 70% of total assets at year end. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net property and equipment increased $1.4 billion primarily due to capital expenditures, partly offset by depreciation.Operating income is used to compute return on average assets, while net income is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. 2012 2011 2010Return on average assets25.4% 26.0% 24.7%Return on average common equity37.5 37.7 35.3In 2012, return on average assets and return on average common equity decreased due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation primarily on operating income and net income. In 2011, return on average assets and return on average common equity benefited from strong global operating results and the positive impact of foreign currency translation. Operating income, as reported, does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. The inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by about two percentage points for all years presented. McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report 21FINANCING AND MARKET RISKThe Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2012 totaled $13.6 billion, compared with $12.5 billion at December 31, 2011. The net increase in 2012 was primarily due to net issuances of $1.2 billion.Debt highlights(1) 2012 2011 2010Fixed-rate debt as a percent of total debt(2,3)74% 69% 66%Weighted-average annual interest rate of total debt(3)4.0 4.2 4.3Foreign currency-denominated debt as a percent of total debt(2)36 40 41Total debt as a percent of total Capitalization (total debt and total Shareholders' equity)(2)47 46 44Cash provided by operations as a percent of total debt(2)51 57 55(1)All percentages are as of December 31, except for the weighted-average annual interest rate, which is for the year.(2)Based on debt obligations before the effect of fair value hedging adjustments.

There are no provisions in the Company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company’s business. Under existing authorization from the Company’s Board of Directors, at December 31, 2012, the Company had $5.4 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $1.5 billion available under committed line of credit agreements as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and global markets (see Debt Financing note to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K). Debt maturing in 2013 is approximately $690 million of long-term corporate debt. In 2013, the Company expects to issue commercial paper and long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. As of December 31, 2012, the Company also had $581 million of foreign currency borrowings outstanding primarily under uncommitted line of credit agreements.The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $4.9 billion and $5.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives.The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2012, neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Company’s supplemental benefit plan liabilities where our counterparty was required to post collateral on its liability position.The Company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Company’s largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows:Foreign currency net asset exposuresIn millions of U.S. Dollars2012 2011Euro$6,692 $5,905Australian Dollars2,450 2,409Canadian Dollars1,319 1,224British Pounds Sterling1,117 726Russian Ruble651 594The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the U.S. Based on the results of these analyses of the Company’s financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2012 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2012 levels would materially affect the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments.LIQUIDITYThe Company has significant operations outside the United States where we earn over 60% of our operating income. A significant portion of these historical earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the Company 22 McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Reporthas made, and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations. Accordingly, no U.S. federal or state income taxes have been provided on the undistributed foreign earnings. The Company's cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2012. We do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate these funds.Consistent with prior years, we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, annual repatriation of a portion of the current period's foreign earnings, and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating, investing, and financing activities. We also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating, investing, and financing activities.In the future, should we require more capital to fund activities in the United States than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the future.While the likelihood is remote, to the extent foreign cash is available, the Company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (net of an adjustment for foreign tax credits) which could result in a use of cash. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings. Refer to the Income Taxes note to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for further information related to our income taxes and the undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTSThe Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2012. See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for further details.

Debt obligations do not include $42 million of noncash fair value hedging adjustments or $217 million of accrued interest. The Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of IRS limitations. At December 31, 2012, total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $493 million, and total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $482 million.There are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business. The amounts related to these commitments are not significant to the Company’s financial position. Such commitments are generally shorter term in nature and will be funded from operating cash flows.Other Matters CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions.The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity:▪Property and equipmentProperty and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.▪Share-based compensationThe Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (""RSUs"") to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period.The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Company’s stock over the expected McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual Report 23life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period.▪Long-lived assets impairment reviewLong-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Company’s long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Company’s experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, the Company does not have any reporting units (defined as each individual country) with goodwill currently at risk of impairment.▪Litigation accrualsIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made aftercareful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.▪Income taxesThe Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made.The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. In 2012, the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") completed its examination of the Company's U.S. federal income tax returns for 2007 and 2008. The Company and the IRS reached an agreement on adjustments that had been previously proposed by the IRS. The agreement did not have a material impact on the Company's cash flows, results of operations or financial position. The Company's 2009 and 2010 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently under examination and the completion of the field examination is expected in 2013.Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $14.8 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If management's intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided.EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES—INFLATIONThe Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation.RECONCILIATION OF RETURNS ON INCREMENTAL INVESTED CAPITALROIIC is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Company’s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period.The denominator is the weighted-average cash used for investing activities during the applicable one-or three-year period. The weighted-average cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter’s investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2012 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2012 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2011 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full-year impact on 2012 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2011 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average.The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one-year and three-year ROIIC are as follows:24 McDonald's Corporation 2012 Annual ReportOne-year ROIIC calculation (dollars in millions):Years ended December 31,2012 2011 Incrementalchange NUMERATOR: Operating income$8,604.6 $8,529.7 $74.9Depreciation and amortization1,488.5 1,415.0 73.5Currency translation(1) 286.1Incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates)$434.5DENOMINATOR: Weighted-average cash used for investing activities(2) $2,826.3Currency translation(1) 3.0Weighted-average cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates) $2,829.3One-year ROIIC 15.4%(1)Represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured.(2)Represents one-year weighted-average cash used for investing activities, determined by applying the weightings below to the cash used for investing activities for each quarter in the two-year period ended December 31, 2012.

63908,MCD,MCDONALDS CORP,2014,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OverviewDESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESSThe Company franchises and operates McDonald’s restaurants. Of the 35,429 restaurants in 119 countries at year-end 2013, 28,691 were franchised (including 20,355 franchised to conventional franchisees, 4,747 licensed to developmental licensees and 3,589 licensed to foreign affiliates (""affiliates"")—primarily Japan) and 6,738 were operated by the Company. Under our conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and décor of their restaurant business, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants. Under our developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market.We view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is important to both delivering great, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. However, directly operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. In our Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. We continually review, and as appropriate adjust, our mix of Company-operated and franchised (conventional franchised, developmental licensed and foreign affiliated) restaurants to help optimize overall performance.The Company’s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms.The business is managed as distinct geographic segments. Significant reportable segments include the United States (""U.S.""), Europe, and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (""APMEA""). In addition, throughout this report we present “Other Countries & Corporate” that includes operations in Canada and Latin America, as well as Corporate activities. The U.S., Europe and APMEA segments account for 31%, 40% and 23% of total revenues, respectively. The United Kingdom (""U.K.""), France, Russia and Germany, collectively, account for 67% of Europe’s revenues; and China, Australia and Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), collectively, account for 54% of APMEA’s revenues. These seven markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as “major markets” throughout this report and comprise 75% of total revenues.In analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth and returns.▪Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because we believe this better represents the Company’s underlying business trends.▪Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of the impact of the Company’s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. Generally, pricing has a greater impact on average check than product mix. The goal is to achieve a balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check. McDonald’s reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays and weekend days in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts. The Company refers to these impacts as calendar shift/trading day adjustments. In addition, the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts. These impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have a more pronounced effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal.▪Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company’s financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.▪Return on incremental invested capital (""ROIIC"") is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation.STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEThe strength of the alignment among the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the ""System"") has been key to McDonald's success. By leveraging our System, we are able to identify, implement and scale ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. In addition, our business model 10 McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Reportenables McDonald's to consistently deliver locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve.McDonald's customer-focused Plan to Win (""Plan"") provides a common framework that aligns our global business and allows for local adaptation. We continue to focus on our three global growth priorities of optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience, and broadening accessibility to Brand McDonald's within the framework of our Plan. Our initiatives support these priorities, and are executed with a focus on the Plan's five pillars - People, Products, Place, Price and Promotion - to enhance our customers' experience and build shareholder value over the long term. We believe these priorities align with our customers' evolving needs, and - combined with our competitive advantages of convenience, menu variety, geographic diversification and System alignment - will drive long-term sustainable growth.To measure our performance as we strive to build the business, we have the following long-term, average annual constant currency financial targets:▪Systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5%;▪Operating income growth of 6% to 7%;▪ROIIC in the high teens.In 2013, Systemwide sales growth was 1% (3% in constant currencies), operating income growth was 2% (3% in constant currencies), one-year ROIIC was 11.4% and three-year ROIIC was 20.2% (see reconciliation on page 23). Our operating income growth and returns fell below our long-term financial targets, reflecting the impact of soft comparable sales performance. In our heavily franchised business model, growing comparable sales is important to increasing operating income and returns.In 2013, our comparable sales increased 0.2%, reflecting higher average check and negative comparable guest counts of 1.9%. Challenging conditions, including a flat or contracting informal eating out (“IEO”) segment in most major markets, heightened competitive activity and consumer price sensitivity, continued to pressure performance. Furthermore, McDonald’s customer-facing initiatives did not generate the comparable sales lift or customer visits necessary to overcome these headwinds. In 2014, we do not expect significant changes in market dynamics given modest growth projections for the IEO segment. However, we continue to believe that our targets remain achievable over the long term. The following is a summary of our 2013 sales performance and our initiatives within the three global growth priorities by major segment.U.S.In the U.S., comparable sales declined 0.2% and comparable guest counts declined 1.6%. Guest visits were down as initiatives did not resonate as strongly as expected with customers amid a sluggish IEO segment and heightened competitive activity. The U.S. introduced a number of significant new products (such as Premium McWraps, Egg White Delight McMuffins and an extended line-up of Quarter Pounder Burgers) and featured new limited-time food and beverage options to enhance the relevance of its product offerings.Modernizing the customer experience continued through our reimaging program. During 2013, we completed about 700 restaurant reimages, of which the majority added drive-thru capacity. Currently, 45% of our restaurant interiors and exteriors reflect our contemporary restaurant design. We broadened accessibility by opening 225 new restaurants, extending hours in more restaurants, and improving the efficiency of our drive-thru service with side-by-side or tandem ordering, and hand-held order taking. More than half of our restaurants now use one of these multiple order points to maximize drive-thru capacity. In addition, the U.S. evolved its value proposition with the recent introduction of Dollar Menu & More, which is intended to offer value and variety to our customers at various price points.EuropeIn Europe, comparable sales were flat, while comparable guest counts declined 1.5%, as persistently low consumer confidence continued to negatively affect the IEO segment. Comparable sales results reflected positive performance in the U.K. and Russia, which were mostly offset by weak performance in Germany, where we are working on rebuilding brand relevance to address the current negative guest count trend.In 2013, we remained focused on growing the business by emphasizing value menu enhancements, premium menu additions, limited-time offers and expansion of the breakfast daypart. We also successfully launched blended ice beverages in the U.K., which positively contributed to results.In order to continue providing a relevant, contemporary customer experience, Europe completed about 470 restaurant reimages during the year. By the end of 2013, nearly 100% of restaurant interiors and 80% of exteriors were modernized. We increased our accessibility and convenience by opening 312 new restaurants, extending operating hours and optimizing our drive-thrus. We enhanced our value offerings in certain markets with multiple pricing tiers across our menu to appeal to a broad range of customers. For example, in France we launched the Casse-Croûte, a two-item meal for 4.50 Euro, which positively contributed to recent results in that market.APMEAIn APMEA, comparable sales declined 1.9% and comparable guest counts declined 3.8%. Our three largest markets experienced negative comparable sales, with Japan having the most significant impact. Though the challenges differ across the segment, overall performance was pressured amid slower economic growth, a highly competitive environment focused primarily on value, and issues such as Avian influenza in a few markets. In addition, softer than expected performance of new products and promotions did not overcome negative guest count trends.Throughout the segment, we focused on accelerating growth across all dayparts, with particular emphasis on dinner and the expansion of breakfast. APMEA held a National Breakfast Day, during which five thousand restaurants gave away five million Egg McMuffins to promote breakfast in the segment. We were also committed to enhancing local relevance with consumers, by balancing our global core menu with locally-relevant food and beverage choices, which included new flavor profiles designed to match local tastes. We continued to make progress in our reimaging program, completing about 240 restaurant reimages during the year. By the end of 2013, over 65% of restaurant interiors and over 55% of exteriors were modernized. We opened 731 new restaurants, including 275 in China. We deployed our convenience initiatives to more restaurants, including dessert kiosks, delivery service, drive-thrus and extended hours. In addition, we continued to evolve our everyday value platform by including more affordable menu options and promotional offers across dayparts and price points. McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report 11Consolidated Operating ResultsGlobally, our approach to offering variety and value across the menu to our customers is complemented by a focus on driving operating efficiencies, and leveraging our scale and supply chain infrastructure to manage costs. In 2013, we maintained a full-year combined operating margin of 31.2%, as we grew revenues 2% and managed our expenses. We continued our long-standing commitment to fiscal discipline and maintained a strong financial foundation. Cash from operations benefits from our heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income we receive from franchisees provides a stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs. In addition, the franchise business model is less capital intensive than the Company-owned model. We believe locally-owned and operated restaurants are important to McDonald's being not just a global brand, but also a locally-relevant one.In 2013, cash from operations was $7.1 billion. Our substantial cash flow, strong credit rating and continued access to credit provided us flexibility to fund capital expenditures as well as return cash to shareholders. Capital expenditures of approximately $2.8 billion were invested in our business, of which more than half was devoted to new restaurant openings and the remainder was reinvested in our existing restaurants. Across the System, 1,438 restaurants were opened and over 1,500 existing locations were reimaged. We continued to return all free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures) to shareholders, and in 2013 returned $4.9 billion to shareholders consisting of $3.1 billion in dividends and $1.8 billion in share repurchases.RESULTS FROM THE YEAR:▪Global comparable sales increased 0.2% and comparable guest counts declined 1.9%. ▪Consolidated revenues increased 2% (2% in constant currencies).▪Consolidated operating income increased 2% (3% in constant currencies).▪Diluted earnings per share was $5.55, an increase of 4% (4% in constant currencies).▪Cash provided by operations was $7.1 billion.▪One-year ROIIC was 11.4% and three-year ROIIC was 20.2% for the period ended December 31, 2013.▪The Company increased the quarterly cash dividend per share 5% to $0.81 for the fourth quarter, equivalent to an annual dividend of $3.24 per share.▪The Company returned $4.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.OUTLOOK FOR 2014 We are focused on delivering great-tasting, high-quality, affordable food and beverages and an exceptional experience for our customers. By leveraging our competitive advantages, we are well-positioned to pursue the long-term opportunities that exist in the over $1 trillion IEO segment.We do not expect significant changes in market dynamics in 2014 given modest growth projections for the IEO segment. We will remain focused on matters within our control, with the customer as our first priority. We plan to strengthen our relationship with the customer through better restaurant execution and by further leveraging consumer insights in our efforts to optimize current initiatives for greater relevance and broader consumer reach. We remain committed to adapting to keep pace with evolving customer needs and investing today to meet future demand. In addition, we are prioritizing our near-term efforts on improving performance in key opportunity markets that are significant contributors to consolidated results. These include Germany, Japan and the U.S., which have experienced weak or negative performance. We will continue to execute against our three global growth priorities to optimize our menu, modernize the customer experience and broaden accessibility to Brand McDonald’s. Our focus will be on our core classics, as well as menu items in the beef, chicken, breakfast and beverages categories, where we believe there is the most growth opportunity relative to other categories in the industry. In addition, we plan to introduce new ingredients and greater choice to broaden the appeal of our menu. We will enhance the customer experience by continuing to reimage our building interiors and exteriors, expand our service offerings and develop our digital strategies. At the same time, we remain committed to Quality, Service and Cleanliness, which is foundational to everything we do in the restaurants. To broaden our accessibility, we plan to expand through geographically diversified new restaurant development, extend hours in more restaurants, improve the efficiency of our drive-thrus and provide more delivery service and dessert kiosks. In addition, we will continue to evolve our value platform, offering more choices at every price tier.Furthermore, McDonald’s is committed to growing our business sustainably and making a positive difference in society. Our key areas of focus include improving customer perceptions of our food, sustainable sourcing, providing job opportunities and training for our people, developing environmentally efficient restaurants and having a positive impact in the communities we serve. U.S.In 2014, the U.S. will make adjustments designed to regain momentum, including providing greater customer relevance and better restaurant execution. Our 2014 menu strategies better balance affordability, core products, new choices and limited-time offers. We will also adjust the pace of product introductions to improve restaurant operations and marketing execution in order to provide a better customer experience. These initiatives are complemented by a consistent focus on core equities, such as breakfast. We will enhance the breakfast experience by emphasizing coffee through high-quality McCafé products paired with delicious foods - both existing and new. Bold new flavor extensions will be introduced to build upon our core and lay the groundwork for future innovations. We plan to open about 250 new restaurants and to continue our reimaging program by updating approximately 300 existing restaurants in 2014, a slightly slower pace as we prioritize other kitchen investments.EuropeIn Europe, we plan to optimize the menu through value menu enhancements, premium menu additions and limited-time offers, and will continue to expand the breakfast daypart by leveraging our strong foundation in coffee. In addition, following the U.K.’s successful rollout of McCafé smoothies and frappés, we anticipate about 4,500 restaurants in Europe will have the blended-ice platform by the end of 2014.To modernize the way we interact with our customers, we plan to leverage the use of technology, such as self-order kiosks and mobile and web ordering. We will focus on broadening accessibility by continuing to extend operating hours, optimizing drive-thrus, and expanding everyday value platforms. We plan to open over 300 new restaurants and reimage approximately 400 existing restaurants in 2014. 12 McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual ReportAPMEAIn 2014, APMEA’s growth opportunities include menu variety, convenience, value evolution and restaurant expansion. We will balance core and limited-time offers and execute a series of exciting food events. APMEA will shift existing value platforms toward more compelling offers that resonate with customers and generate incremental visits, including “mid-tier” options to fill the gap between entry-level options and Extra Value Meals. Our efforts around reimaging will continue as we expect to modernize approximately 400 existing restaurants. Our plan is to open around 800 new restaurants, with about 300 expected in China. In addition, we will evolve our franchising strategy to include more conventional franchisees and developmental licensees, enabling an increased pace of development and enhanced profitability.Consolidated In making capital allocation decisions, our goal is to make investments that elevate the McDonald's experience and drive sustainable long-term growth in sales and market share. We focus on markets that generate strong returns or have opportunities for long-term growth. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures) to shareholders over the long-term via dividends and share repurchases. McDonald's does not provide specific guidance on diluted earnings per share. The following information is provided to assist in forecasting the Company's future results:▪Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 2.5 percentage points to 2014 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies), most of which will be due to the 949 net restaurants (1,098 net traditional openings less 149 net satellite closings) added in 2013. ▪The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point change in comparable sales for either the U.S. or Europe would change annual diluted earnings per share by about 4 cents. ▪With about 75% of McDonald's grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Company's commodity costs. For the full year 2014, the total basket of goods cost is expected to increase 1.0-2.0% in the U.S. and Europe. ▪The Company expects full-year 2014 selling, general and administrative expenses to increase approximately 8% in constant currencies, with fluctuations expected between the quarters. The increase is primarily due to the impact of below target 2013 incentive-based compensation, expenses associated with our Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention and sponsorship of the Winter Olympic games, and costs related to other initiatives. ▪Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full year 2014 to increase approximately 5-7% compared with 2013. ▪A significant part of the Company's operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 40% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 65% of the Company's operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Company's annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 25 cents.▪The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2014 to be 31% to 33%. Some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate that is outside the annual range. ▪The Company expects capital expenditures for 2014 to be between $2.9 - $3.0 billion. Over half of this amount will be used to open new restaurants. The Company expects to open about 1,500 - 1,600 restaurants including about 500 restaurants in affiliated and developmental licensee markets, such as Japan and Latin America, where the Company does not fund any capital expenditures. The Company expects net additions of between 1,000 - 1,100 restaurants. The remaining capital will be used to reinvest in existing locations, in part through reimaging. Over 1,000 restaurants worldwide are expected to be reimaged, including locations in affiliated and developmental licensee markets that require no capital investment from the Company.▪The Company expects to return approximately $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2014.

In 2012, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results primarily due to the weaker Euro, along with most other currencies. In 2011, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results driven by the stronger Euro and Australian Dollar, as well as most other currencies.Impact of foreign currency translation on reported results Reported amount Currency translation benefit/(cost) In millions, except per share data 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011Revenues $28,106 $27,567 $27,006 $(29) $(726) $944Company-operated margins 3,296 3,379 3,455 (7) (97) 134Franchised margins 7,607 7,437 7,232 (43) (204) 213Selling, general & administrative expenses 2,386 2,455 2,394 (5) 40 (55)Operating income 8,764 8,605 8,530 (66) (261) 301Net income 5,586 5,465 5,503 (52) (178) 195Earnings per common share—diluted 5.55 5.36 5.27 (0.05) (0.17) 0.19 14 McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual ReportNET INCOME AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHAREIn 2013, net income increased 2% (3% in constant currencies) to $5.6 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased 4% (4% in constant currencies) to $5.55. Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.05 on diluted earnings per share. Net income and diluted earnings per share growth in constant currencies were positively impacted by higher franchised margin dollars, and to a lesser extent, lower selling, general and administrative expenses. This was partly offset by lower Company-operated margin dollars. A decrease in diluted weighted average shares outstanding also contributed to the diluted earnings per share growth in 2013.In 2012, net income decreased 1% (increased 3% in constant currencies) to $5.5 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased 2% (5% in constant currencies) to $5.36. Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.17 on diluted earnings per share. Net income and diluted earnings per share growth in constant currencies were positively impacted by growth in franchised margin dollars, partly offset by a higher effective income tax rate and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. A decrease in diluted weighted average shares outstanding also contributed to the diluted earnings per share growth in 2012.The Company repurchased 18.7 million shares of its stock for $1.8 billion in 2013 and 28.1 million shares of its stock for $2.6 billion in 2012, driving reductions in weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods. REVENUESThe Company’s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales, minimum rent payments and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees.In 2013, constant currency revenue growth was due to expansion. Weak comparable sales reflected a muted response to customer-facing initiatives amid a highly competitive and sluggish IEO segment across many markets. In 2012, constant currency revenue growth was driven primarily by positive comparable sales as well as expansion.Revenues Amount Increase/(decrease) Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation Dollars in millions 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2013 2012Company-operated sales: U.S. $4,512 $4,530 $4,433 0% 2% 0% 2%Europe 8,138 7,850 7,852 4 0 3 6APMEA 5,425 5,350 5,061 1 6 2 5Other Countries & Corporate 800 873 947 (8) (8) (6) (7)Total $18,875 $18,603 $18,293 1% 2% 1% 4%Franchised revenues: U.S. $4,339 $4,284 $4,096 1% 5% 1% 5%Europe 3,162 2,977 3,034 6 (2) 4 5APMEA 1,052 1,041 958 1 9 8 9Other Countries & Corporate 678 662 625 2 6 8 11Total $9,231 $8,964 $8,713 3% 3% 3% 6%Total revenues: U.S. $8,851 $8,814 $8,529 0% 3% 0% 3%Europe 11,300 10,827 10,886 4 (1) 3 6APMEA 6,477 6,391 6,019 1 6 3 6Other Countries & Corporate 1,478 1,535 1,572 (4) (2) 0 0Total $28,106 $27,567 $27,006 2% 2% 2% 5% In the U.S., revenues were relatively flat in 2013 as the positive impact of expansion was offset by negative comparable sales, reflecting initiatives that did not resonate as strongly as expected with customers. Revenues increased in 2012 primarily due to positive comparable sales, reflecting everyday value offerings, menu variety and the enhanced customer experience due to reimaging, despite broad competitive activity.Europe's constant currency increase in revenues in 2013 benefited from expansion, primarily in Russia (which is almost entirely Company-operated), and positive comparable sales performance in the U.K. and Russia, the segment's two largest Company-operated restaurant markets, partly offset by negative results in Germany. The 2012 increase was primarily driven by positive comparable sales in the U.K. and Russia, as well as expansion in Russia. In APMEA, the constant currency increase in revenues in 2013 was driven by expansion in China and other markets, partly offset by negative comparable sales, primarily in China (which is mostly Company-operated). The constant currency increase in revenues in 2012 was primarily driven by positive comparable sales in China, Australia and many other markets, as well as expansion, primarily in China.

The franchised margin percent was flat in 2012 as positive comparable sales performance was offset by higher depreciation related to reimaging. In Europe, the franchised margin percent decreased in 2013 due to higher rent expense in many markets and weak 16 McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Reportcomparable sales primarily due to Germany. The decrease in 2012 reflected positive comparable sales and higher occupancy costs.In APMEA, the franchised margin percent decreased in 2013 partly due to Japan's negative sales performance and the impact of the weaker Yen, which reduced its contribution to the segment's margin percent. In addition, the segment was negatively impacted by a decline in Australia's results. The decrease in 2012 was primarily due to Australia.The franchised margin percent in APMEA and Other Countries & Corporate is higher relative to the U.S. and Europe due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed and/or affiliated restaurants where the Company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs.▪Company-operated marginsCompany-operated margin dollars represent sales by Company-operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. Company-operated margin dollars decreased $83 million or 2% (2% in constant currencies) in 2013, and decreased $76 million or 2% (increased 1% in constant currencies) in 2012. In 2013, Company-operated margin dollars reflected weak comparable sales in many markets, which impacted our ability to overcome cost pressures. On a constant currency basis, the decrease in Company-operated margin dollars was primarily due to APMEA and the U.S., partly offset by positive performance in Europe. In 2012, Company-operated margin dollars were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation of $97 million, primarily in Europe. On a constant currency basis, the increase in Company-operated margin dollars was due to positive performance in Europe, offset by lower results in APMEA and the U.S. as positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher costs.

The margin percent decreased in 2012 primarily due to higher commodity and labor costs, partly offset by positive comparable sales.Europe’s Company-operated margin percent increased in 2013 due to the positive impact of sales performance in Russia, the U.K. and France, mostly offset by higher commodity and occupancy costs. The margin percent decreased in 2012 primarily due to higher labor and commodity costs across several markets, despite positive comparable sales in Russia and the U.K. In APMEA, the Company-operated margin percent in 2013 decreased primarily due to higher labor, occupancy and other costs, and negative comparable guest counts, partly offset by a higher average check. The margin percent decreased in 2012 primarily due to higher labor and occupancy costs, partly offset by positive comparable sales. New restaurant openings, mainly in China, negatively impacted the margin percent in both periods. Similar to other markets, new restaurants in China initially open with lower margins that grow over time. SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSESConsolidated selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 3% (3% in constant currencies) in 2013 and increased 3% (4% in constant currencies) in 2012. The 2013 decrease was due to lower incentive-based compensation, partly offset by higher employee costs. The comparison to costs related to the 2012 London Olympics sponsorship and the 2012 Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention also contributed to the decrease in 2013, as well as the increase in 2012. The growth in 2012 was also due to higher employee and technology- related costs, partly offset by lower incentive-based compensation.Selling, general & administrative expenses Amount Increase/(decrease) Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation Dollars in millions2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2013 2012U.S.$740 $782 $779 (5%) 0% (5%) 0%Europe703 695 699 1 (1) 0 5APMEA355 353 341 1 4 1 3Other Countries & Corporate(1)588 625 575 (6) 9 (6) 9Total$2,386 $2,455 $2,394 (3%) 3% (3%) 4%(1)Included in Other Countries & Corporate are home office support costs in areas such as facilities, finance, human resources, information technology, legal, marketing, restaurant operations, supply chain and training.Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues were 8.5% in 2013 and 8.9% in 2012 and 2011. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales were 2.7% in 2013 and 2.8% in 2012 and 2011. Management believes that analyzing selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales, as well as revenues, is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support the overall McDonald's business.

Resulting gains or losses on sales of restaurant businesses are recorded in operating income because these transactions are a recurring part of our business. Gains on sales of restaurant businesses increased in 2013 due primarily to more stores sold in Australia. The increase in 2012 was due primarily to sales of restaurants in China to developmental licensees, as well as sales of restaurants in Europe and Canada. ▪Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliatesUnconsolidated affiliates and partnerships are businesses in which the Company actively participates, but does not control. The Company records equity in earnings from these entities representing McDonald’s share of results. For foreign affiliated markets—primarily Japan—results are reported after interest expense and income taxes. McDonald’s share of results for partnerships in certain consolidated markets such as the U.S. is reported before income taxes. These partnership restaurants are operated under conventional franchise arrangements and, therefore, are classified as conventional franchised restaurants. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased in 2013 and 2012 due to lower operating results, primarily in Japan.▪Asset dispositions and other expenseAsset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for restaurant closings and uncollectible receivables, asset write-offs due to restaurant reinvestment, and other miscellaneous income and expenses. Asset dispositions and other expense decreased in 2013 due to the favorable resolution of certain liabilities and lower asset retirements, partly offset by lower gains on property sales and unconsolidated partnership dissolutions. The increase in 2012 was primarily due to lower gains on unconsolidated partnership dissolutions in the U.S. OPERATING INCOMEOperating income Amount Increase/(decrease) Increase excluding currency translation Dollars in millions2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2013 2012U.S.$3,779 $3,751 $3,666 1% 2% 1% 2%Europe3,371 3,196 3,227 5 (1) 4 6APMEA1,480 1,566 1,526 (6) 3 0 3Other Countries & Corporate134 92 111 46 (17) 86 9Total$8,764 $8,605 $8,530 2% 1% 3% 4%In the U.S., results for 2013 increased due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses and higher franchised margin dollars, partly offset by lower Company-operated margin dollars. Results for 2012 increased due to higher franchised margin dollars, partly offset by lower other operating income and Company-operated margin dollars.In Europe, results for 2013 and 2012 were driven by higher franchised and Company-operated margin dollars. Results in 2012 also benefited from higher gains on sales of restaurants, partly offset by incremental selling, general and administrative expenses related to the 2012 London Olympics. In APMEA, results for 2013 reflected higher franchised margin dollars, mostly offset by lower Company-operated margin dollars. Results for 2012 increased primarily due to higher franchised margin dollars and gains on sales of restaurants in China to developmental licensees, partly offset by lower Company-operated margin dollars and lower operating results in Japan.▪Combined operating marginCombined operating margin is defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues. Combined operating margin was 31.2% in 2013 and 2012, and 31.6% in 2011.18 McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual ReportINTEREST EXPENSEInterest expense increased 1% and 5% in 2013 and 2012, respectively, primarily due to higher average debt balances, partly offset by lower average interest rates.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXESIn 2013, 2012 and 2011, the reported effective income tax rates were 31.9%, 32.4% and 31.3%, respectively.In 2013, the effective income tax rate included a tax benefit of nearly $50 million, reflecting the retroactive impact of certain tax benefits as a result of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.In 2012, the effective income tax rate reflected the negative impact of certain tax benefits in the U.S. that had expired at December 31, 2011 and were reinstated retroactively in 2013 as noted above.Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.5 billion in 2013 and 2012. Substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the U.S. and other profitable markets.Cash Flows The Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases.Cash provided by operations totaled $7.1 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.3 billion in 2013, while cash provided by operations totaled $7.0 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $3.9 billion in 2012. In 2013, cash provided by operations increased $155 million or 2% compared with 2012 primarily due to increased operating results. In 2012, cash provided by operations decreased $184 million or 3% compared with 2011 despite increased operating results, primarily due to higher income tax payments and the negative impact of foreign currency translation on operating results. Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.7 billion in 2013, a decrease of $493 million compared with 2012. The decrease primarily reflected lower capital expenditures and a decrease in other investing activities related to short-term time deposits. Cash used for investing activities totaled $3.2 billion in 2012, an increase of $596 million compared with 2011. The increase primarily reflected higher capital expenditures, an increase in other investing activities related to short-term time deposits, and lower proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses.Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.0 billion in 2013, an increase of $193 million compared with 2012, primarily due to lower net debt issuances and higher dividend payments, partly offset by lower treasury stock purchases. Cash used for financing activities totaled $3.8 billion in 2012, a decrease of $683 million compared with 2011, primarily due to lower treasury stock purchases and higher net debt issuances, partly offset by higher dividend payments.The Company’s cash and equivalents balance was $2.8 billion and $2.3 billion at year end 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company made a debt repayment of $535 million in January 2014. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements.RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURESIn 2013, the Company opened 1,393 traditional restaurants and 45 satellite restaurants (small, limited-menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 295 traditional restaurants and 194 satellite restaurants. In 2012, the Company opened 1,404 traditional restaurants and 35 satellite restaurants and closed 269 traditional restaurants and 200 satellite restaurants. The majority of restaurant openings and closings occurred in the major markets in both years. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure.Systemwide restaurants at year end(1) 2013 2012 2011U.S.14,278 14,157 14,098Europe7,602 7,368 7,156APMEA9,918 9,454 8,865Other Countries & Corporate3,631 3,501 3,391Total35,429 34,480 33,510(1)Includes satellite units at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, as follows: U.S.—973, 997, 1,084; Europe—261, 246, 240; APMEA (primarily Japan)—733, 871, 949; Other Countries & Corporate—451, 453, 459.Approximately 70% of Company-operated restaurants and 75% of franchised restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2013. Over 80% of the restaurants at year-end 2013 were franchised. McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report 19Capital expenditures decreased $224 million or 7% in 2013, primarily due to lower reinvestment in existing restaurants, partly offset by higher investment in new restaurants. Capital expenditures increased $319 million or 12% in 2012, primarily due to higher reinvestment in existing restaurants and higher investment in new restaurants. In 2013, the lower reinvestment primarily reflected fewer planned reimages. In both years, the increase related to new restaurants reflected our commitment to broaden accessibility to our brand.Capital expenditures invested in major markets, excluding Japan, represented over 70% of the total in 2013, 2012 and 2011. Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts.Capital expenditures In millions2013 2012 2011New restaurants$1,473 $1,340 $1,193Existing restaurants1,244 1,615 1,432Other(1)108 94 105Total capital expenditures$2,825 $3,049 $2,730Total assets$36,626 $35,386 $32,990(1)Primarily corporate equipment and other office-related expenditures.New restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with strong returns or opportunities for long-term growth. Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, and leveraging best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonald’s restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $3.0 million in 2013.The Company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2013 and 2012.SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDSFor the last three years, the Company returned a total of $16.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends.Shares repurchased and dividends In millions, except per share data2013 2012 2011Number of shares repurchased18.7 28.1 41.9Shares outstanding at year end990 1,003 1,021Dividends declared per share$3.12 $2.87 $2.53 Treasury stock purchases (in Shareholders' equity)$1,810 $2,605 $3,373Dividends paid3,115 2,897 2,610Total returned to shareholders$4,925 $5,502 $5,983 The Company’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, effective August 1, 2012, that authorizes the purchase of up to $10 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date. In 2013, approximately 18.7 million shares were repurchased for $1.8 billion, bringing the total purchases under the program to $2.6 billion. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 38 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2013 full year dividend of $3.12 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.77 per share, with an increase to $0.81 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 5% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $3.24 per share annual dividend and reflects the Company’s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors.Financial Position and Capital Resources TOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNSTotal assets increased $1.2 billion or 4% in 2013. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total assets increased $1.5 billion in 2013. Approximately 80% of total assets were in major markets at year-end 2013. Net property and equipment increased $1.1 billion in 2013, primarily due to capital expenditures, partly offset by depreciation, and represented about 70% of total assets at year end.Operating income is used to compute return on average assets, while net income is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity.Returns on assets and equity 2013 2012 2011Return on average assets24.8% 25.4% 26.0%Return on average commonequity35.8 37.5 37.7In 2013, return on average assets and return on average common equity decreased, reflecting lower growth in operating results. In 2012, return on average assets and return on average common equity decreased due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation primarily on operating income and net income. Operating income does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. The inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by about two percentage points for all years presented.20 McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual ReportFINANCING AND MARKET RISKThe Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2013 totaled $14.1 billion, compared with $13.6 billion at December 31, 2012. The net increase in 2013 was primarily due to net issuances of $535 million.Debt highlights(1) 2013 2012 2011Fixed-rate debt as a percent of totaldebt(2,3)74% 74% 69%Weighted-average annual interestrate of total debt(3)4.0 4.0 4.2Foreign currency-denominated debtas a percent of total debt(2)41 36 40Total debt as a percent of totalcapitalization (total debt and totalShareholders' equity)(2)47 47 46Cash provided by operations as apercent of total debt(2)50 51 57(1)All percentages are as of December 31, except for the weighted-average annual interest rate, which is for the year.(2)Based on debt obligations before the effect of fair value hedging adjustments.

There are no provisions in the Company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company’s business. Under existing authorization from the Company’s Board of Directors, at December 31, 2013, the Company had $3.6 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $1.5 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and global markets (see Debt Financing note to the consolidated financial statements). Debt maturing in 2014 is approximately $530 million of long-term corporate debt. In 2014, the Company expects to issue commercial paper and long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. As of December 31, 2013, the Company's subsidiaries also had $610 million of borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements.The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $5.8 billion and $4.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See the Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives.The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2013, neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Company’s supplemental benefit plan liabilities where our counterparty was required to post collateral on its liability position.The Company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Company’s largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows:Foreign currency net asset exposuresIn millions of U.S. Dollars2013 2012Euro$7,302 $6,692Australian Dollars1,933 2,450British Pounds Sterling1,479 1,117Canadian Dollars1,412 1,319Russian Ruble737 651The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. Based on the results of these analyses of the Company’s financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2013 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2013 levels would materially affect the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments.LIQUIDITYThe Company has significant operations outside the U.S. where we earn over 60% of our operating income. A significant portion of these historical earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the Company has made, McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report 21and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations. Accordingly, no U.S. federal or state income taxes have been provided on these undistributed foreign earnings. The Company's cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2013. We do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate these funds.Consistent with prior years, we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, annual repatriation of a portion of the current period's foreign earnings, and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating, investing, and financing activities. We also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating, investing, and financing activities.In the future, should we require more capital to fund activities in the U.S. than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the future.While the likelihood is remote, to the extent foreign cash is available, the Company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (net of an adjustment for foreign tax credits), which could result in a use of cash. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings. Refer to the Income Taxes note to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our income taxes and the undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTSThe Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2013. See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

Debt obligations do not include $13 million of noncash fair value hedging adjustments or $222 million of accrued interest. In the U.S., the Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") limitations. At December 31, 2013, total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $531 million.In addition, total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $513 million at December 31, 2013.There are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business. The amounts related to these commitments are not significant to the Company’s financial position. Such commitments are generally shorter term in nature and will be funded from operating cash flows.Other Matters CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions.The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity:▪Property and equipmentProperty and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.▪Share-based compensationThe Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (""RSUs"") to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period.The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Company’s stock over the expected 22 McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Reportlife and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period.▪Long-lived assets impairment reviewLong-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Company’s long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Company’s experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, the Company does not have any reporting units (defined as each individual country) with goodwill currently at risk of impairment.▪Litigation accrualsIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made aftercareful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.▪Income taxesThe Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made.The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. In 2012, the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") completed its examination of the Company's U.S. federal income tax returns for 2007 and 2008. The Company and the IRS reached an agreement on adjustments that had been previously proposed by the IRS. The agreement did not have a material impact on the Company's cash flows, results of operations or financial position. The Company's 2009 and 2010 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently under examination and the completion of the field examination is expected in 2014. In connection with this examination, the Company received notices of proposed adjustments (""NOPAs"") in 2014 and expects to receive additional NOPAs within the next 12 months from the IRS related to certain transfer pricing matters. It is reasonably possible that the receipt of these future NOPAs will provide new information that causes the Company to reassess the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded. While the Company cannot estimate the impact that new information may have on our unrecognized tax benefit balance, we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined under Topic 740 - Income Taxes of the Accounting Standards Codification.Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $16.1 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If management's intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided.EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES—INFLATIONThe Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation.RECONCILIATION OF RETURNS ON INCREMENTAL INVESTED CAPITALROIIC is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of our markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Company’s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period.The denominator is the weighted-average cash used for investing activities during the applicable one-or three-year period. The weighted-average cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter’s investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2013 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2013 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2012 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full-year impact on 2013 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2012 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average.The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one-year and three-year ROIIC are as follows: McDonald's Corporation 2013 Annual Report 23One-year ROIIC calculation (dollars in millions):Years ended December 31,2013 2012 Incrementalchange NUMERATOR: Operating income$8,764.3 $8,604.6 $159.7Depreciation and amortization1,585.1 1,488.5 96.6Currency translation(1) 81.8Incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates) $338.1DENOMINATOR: Weighted-average cash used forinvesting activities(2) $2,951.7Currency translation(1) 1.2Weighted-average cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates) $2,952.9One-year ROIIC 11.4%(1)Represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured.(2)Represents one-year weighted-average cash used for investing activities, determined by applying the weightings below to the cash used for investing activities for each quarter in the two-year period ended December 31, 2013.

63908,MCD,MCDONALDS CORP,2015,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OverviewDESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESSThe Company franchises and operates McDonald’s restaurants. Of the 36,258 restaurants in 119 countries at year-end 2014, 29,544 were franchised (including 20,774 franchised to conventional franchisees, 5,228 licensed to developmental licensees and 3,542 licensed to foreign affiliates (""affiliates"")—primarily Japan) and 6,714 were operated by the Company. Under our conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and décor of their restaurant business, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees enabling restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants in an effort to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives. Under our developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market.We view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is paramount to both delivering great, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. Franchising enables an individual to own a restaurant business and maintain control over personnel, purchasing, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the financial strength and global experience of McDonald's. However, directly operating restaurants is important to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. In our Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. We continually review, and as appropriate adjust, our mix of Company-operated and franchised (conventional franchised, developmental licensed and foreign affiliated) restaurants to help optimize overall performance.The Company’s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms.The business is managed as distinct geographic segments. Significant reportable segments include the United States (""U.S.""), Europe, and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (""APMEA""). In addition, throughout this report we present “Other Countries & Corporate” that includes operations in Canada and Latin America, as well as Corporate activities. The U.S., Europe and APMEA segments account for 32%, 40% and 23% of total revenues, respectively. The United Kingdom (""U.K.""), France, Russia and Germany, collectively, account for 68% of Europe’s revenues; and China, Australia and Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), collectively, account for 52% of APMEA’s revenues. These seven markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as “major markets” throughout this report and comprise 75% of total revenues.In analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth, operating income growth and returns.▪Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases most incentive compensation plans on these results because we believe this better represents the Company’s underlying business trends.▪Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of the impact of the Company’s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. Typically, pricing has a greater impact on average check than product mix. The goal is to achieve a relatively balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check. McDonald’s reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays and weekend days in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts. The Company refers to these impacts as calendar shift/trading day adjustments. In addition, the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts. These impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have a more pronounced effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal.▪Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company’s financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.▪Return on incremental invested capital (""ROIIC"") is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation.12 McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual ReportSTRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEThe strength of the alignment among the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the ""System"") has been key to McDonald's long-term success. By leveraging our System, we are able to identify, implement and scale ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. In addition, our business model enables McDonald's to consistently deliver locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve.McDonald's customer-focused Plan to Win (""Plan"") provides a common framework that aligns our global business and allows for local adaptation through an emphasis on the Plan's five pillars - People, Products, Place, Price and Promotion. In 2014, we evolved our Plan framework, refocusing our planning and actions on what matters most to our customers. The following four strategic growth priorities support our global Plan: ▪Optimizing our menu so that we offer our customers more of their favorite food and drinks; ▪Modernizing the customer experience so interactions with the Brand are more memorable;▪Broadening accessibility to deliver unparalleled convenience; and▪Taking meaningful actions to become an even more trusted brand.We believe that our strategic growth priorities align with our customers' evolving needs and - combined with our competitive advantages of convenience, scale, geographic diversification and System alignment - will enhance our customers’ experience and build shareholder value over the long-term.To measure our performance as we strive to build the business, we have the following long-term, average annual constant currency financial targets:▪Systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5%;▪Operating income growth of 6% to 7%; and▪ROIIC in the high teens.In 2014, our results were disappointing as unforeseen events and weak operating performance pressured results in each of our geographic segments. Systemwide sales decreased 2% (increased 1% in constant currencies), operating income decreased 9% (8% in constant currencies), one-year ROIIC was negative 21.9% and three-year ROIIC was 1.4% (see reconciliation on page 27). Each metric fell below our long-term financial targets, reflecting the impact of soft comparable sales performance and cost pressures, negatively impacting all segments. Given our heavily franchised business model, growing comparable sales is vital to increasing the Company's operating income and returns.We experienced challenges growing sales and guest counts in 2014, as comparable sales decreased 1.0%, reflecting negative guest traffic in all segments. While some of the challenges were anticipated, others were not, such as the impact of a supplier issue in China, Japan and certain other markets (see explanation under APMEA) and the volatile operating environment in Russia and the Ukraine. Results were also impacted by under-performance in key opportunity markets that are significant contributors to consolidated results, most notably the U.S.We anticipate many of these challenges will persist in 2015, particularly in the first half of the year; however, we continue to believe that our long-term financial targets remain achievable over the long term, keeping us focused on making the best decisions for the benefit of our shareholders and our System. We are intensely focused on increasing customer relevance, driving customer visits, and positioning the Company for future growth. In 2014, we took a number of important steps to lay the foundation for our turnaround. The following is a summary of our sales performance and critical actions taken to advance our longer-term strategies by major segment.U.S.In the U.S., comparable sales declined 2.1% and comparable guest counts declined 4.1%. Guest visits were down as customer-focused initiatives did not resonate strongly amid the increasingly competitive marketplace and sluggish industry growth. To enhance customer relevance and loyalty, the U.S. is focused on addressing menu, service and value opportunities.In 2014, we brought in new leadership to provide innovative thinking and a fresh strategic perspective, and we announced actions to create a flatter, more nimble U.S. organization that places greater decision making and accountability closer to the customer.Menu strategies included a focus on continued growth at breakfast, which remains our strongest daypart, and an ongoing emphasis on core food and beverages. In addition, we executed initiatives to build brand trust through strengthened marketing efforts, including the launch of a national food quality campaign. The U.S. focused on improving the service experience through an increased emphasis on operations excellence and investments made in establishing our digital platform, including being the first in our industry to accept Apple Pay in the drive-thru. We continued to invest in new and existing restaurants by opening 222 new restaurants and reimaging approximately 260 locations, of which the majority added or enhanced drive-thru capacity. Currently, about half of our restaurant interiors and exteriors reflect our contemporary restaurant design.We evolved our value platform to reposition entry-level affordability for future growth by providing a means to transition products to a higher price point when appropriate.EuropeIn Europe, comparable sales declined 0.6%, while comparable guest counts declined 2.2%. Comparable sales reflected negative performance in Germany and Russia, mostly offset by positive performance in the UK. Low consumer confidence and other external issues related to the operating environment in Russia and Ukraine negatively impacted business performance. In 2014, we pursued customer-focused initiatives to deliver menu variety, a contemporary restaurant experience and value enhancements. We further optimized our menu through premium menu additions and expanded our McCafé platform with over 4,000 restaurants now serving blended ice beverages.We remain committed to reinvesting in existing restaurants through reimaging and technology initiatives to provide a relevant, contemporary customer experience. Europe completed about 260 restaurant reimages during the year. By the end of 2014, nearly 100% of restaurant interiors and 85% of exteriors were modernized. We continued to leverage technology, with over 2,000 self-order kiosks and mobile ordering and payment capability available in certain markets. We increased our accessibility and convenience through daypart expansion, including breakfast and overnight, opening approximately 320 new restaurants, and optimizing our drive-thrus. As value is paramount to European customers, we continued to evolve and emphasize value offerings at every price tier. McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report 13APMEAIn APMEA, comparable sales declined 3.3% and comparable guest counts declined 4.7% due to negative performance in Japan and China. This was slightly offset by positive results in Australia, the first of our priority markets to demonstrate signs of recovery due to strengthened marketing, re-emphasized value, menu improvements and stronger franchisee alignment.In mid-July, food quality issues were discovered at a supplier to McDonald’s and other food companies in China, negatively impacting results in China, Japan and certain other markets. We moved quickly to source from alternative suppliers and initiated aggressive recovery plans to restore consumer trust and confidence. As a result of our efforts, sales trends in China are showing signs of improvement. McDonald's Japan is not recovering as quickly and has been working to overcome significant challenges. We continued to make progress in our reimaging program, completing about 340 restaurant reimages during the year. By the end of 2014, over 70% of restaurant interiors and over 60% of exteriors were modernized.We are committed to ongoing restaurant expansion, although the pace of new openings was slowed in China in response to local market dynamics. We opened 655 new restaurants, including 227 in China. GlobalGlobally, we have been focused on strengthening the foundational elements of our business, namely value across the menu, marketing and operations excellence to deliver a better customer experience while actively pursuing comprehensive initiatives to capture the sizeable longer-term growth opportunities in our industry.Even in periods of softer performance, McDonald’s unique business model and structure enable us to generate significant cash flows. Cash from operations benefits from our heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income we receive from franchisees provides a stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs and enables us to return significant cash to shareholders. In addition, the franchise business model is less capital intensive than the Company-owned model. We believe locally-owned and operated restaurants are important to McDonald's being not just a global brand, but also a locally-relevant one.In 2014, cash from operations totaled $6.7 billion. Our substantial cash flow, strong credit rating and continued access to credit provided us flexibility to invest in critical growth initiatives while still returning significant amounts of cash to shareholders. Capital expenditures of approximately $2.6 billion were invested in our business, of which more than half was devoted to new restaurant openings and the remainder was reinvested in our existing restaurants. Across the System, 1,316 restaurants were opened and about 930 existing locations were reimaged. As part of our ongoing commitment to build long-term shareholder value, in May 2014, the Company announced a 3-year cash return target of $18 to $20 billion between 2014 and 2016 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, representing a 10% to 20% increase over the amount of cash returned between 2011 and 2013. This target is based on several activities including the significant free cash flow generated from our operations, as well as the use of cash proceeds from our debt additions and refranchising at least 1,500 restaurants over the 2014-2016 period (over 400 restaurants were refranchised in 2014), primarily in APMEA and Europe. In 2014, we returned $6.4 billion to shareholders consisting of $3.2 billion in dividends and $3.2 billion in share repurchases and remain on track to meet our 3-year target. RESULTS FOR THE YEAR:▪Global comparable sales decreased 1.0%, reflecting a decrease in all segments with the exception of Other Countries & Corporate, while comparable guest counts declined 3.6%, reflecting negative guest traffic in all segments. ▪Consolidated revenues decreased 2% (flat in constant currencies).▪Consolidated operating income decreased 9% (8% in constant currencies), primarily due to the impact of the supplier issue in APMEA and weak operating performance in the U.S.▪The Company's effective tax rate was 35.5%, including an increase in reserves related to certain foreign tax matters.▪Diluted earnings per share was $4.82, a decrease of 13% (11% in constant currencies). The following items, which total $0.54 per share, negatively impacted diluted earnings per share by 10% (10% in constant currencies) for the year:*$0.31 per share due to an increase in reserves related to certain foreign tax matters; and*$0.23 per share due to the estimated impact of the supplier issue resulting from lost sales and profitability in APMEA.Excluding the impact of these items, earnings per share for the year would have been down 3% (1% in constant currencies) compared to the prior year.▪Cash provided by operations was $6.7 billion.▪One-year ROIIC was negative 21.9% and three-year ROIIC was 1.4% for the period ended December 31, 2014 (see reconciliation on page 27), reflecting the impact of lower operating income in 2014.▪The Company increased the quarterly cash dividend per share 5% to $0.85 for the fourth quarter, equivalent to an annual dividend of $3.40 per share.▪The Company returned $6.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, in connection with our $18-$20 billion, 3-year cash return target for the years 2014-2016.OUTLOOK FOR 2015 McDonald's begins 2015 taking decisive action to drive foundational improvements in our major markets and executing our recovery efforts in markets affected by unforeseen events. While we expect pressures on operating performance to persist as we continue to face significant headwinds, particularly in the first half of the year, sizable growth opportunities exist in the $1.2 trillion global IEO segment. We are committed to pursuing these opportunities by relentlessly focusing on the customer and adapting to the changing marketplace through the following initiatives. We are redefining menu choice and personalization, exploring solutions that will provide our guests a customizable restaurant experience. We are also focused on enhancing the appeal of our core products and addressing food perceptions by improving and highlighting the quality of our ingredients and engaging with our customers in more transparent dialogue. Convenience continues to be a cornerstone of McDonald's business, and we will evolve our value platform, strategically evaluating pricing relationships across the entry level, core and premium tiers. Service elements focus on hospitality and 14 McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Reportadditional ways to serve customers, such as self-order kiosks and table service, and in-store pick up or in-car delivery in certain markets. Our digital strategy is built around improving the customer experience and customer engagement. Collectively, these customer-focused initiatives represent the Restaurant Experience of the Future and build upon investments we have already made in reimaging and technology. The Company is investing in these significant initiatives in a disciplined manner, by partly redirecting G&A dollars from the U.S. business and Corporate toward these long-term growth initiatives. We will continue to invest in geographically diversified new restaurant development and reimaging of our existing restaurants’ interiors and exteriors. Our 2015 capital expenditure plan of approximately $2.0 billion - our lowest capital budget in more than 5 years - demonstrates financial discipline as we strategically target fewer openings in our most challenged markets. We believe this lower level of capital spending is prudent while we work to regain our business momentum. McDonald’s remains committed to growing our business sustainably and making a positive difference in society by serving good food through good people, and being a good neighbor in the communities in which we operate. U.S.The U.S. begins 2015 with new leadership focused on a strategic roadmap including a revamped marketing approach, greater customization, localization and menu simplification. Our revamped marketing approach includes a new national brand campaign complemented by local advertising that is more responsive to individual market preferences. We plan to execute initiatives that are designed to address customer insights and the competitive dynamics that are unique to each market. We are focused on strengthening our menu pipeline by providing more choice and customization, with plans to begin expanding the Create Your Taste platform in 2015. Our menu initiatives also include plans to enhance core products, particularly in the chicken and beef categories. We are also refining our value proposition to offer the right balance of value and choice and to create more logical relationships across menu price tiers. We plan to open about 125 new restaurants and reimage approximately 100 existing restaurants in 2015.EuropeThe segment's prolonged economic slowdown is expected to continue to impact business performance in 2015. In addition, the IEO landscape remains sluggish and highly competitive. Despite these challenges, we are focusing on those areas within our control to grow sales and traffic. Menu plans include balancing a strong track record of successful promotions with an ongoing focus on our iconic core favorites. We are pursuing opportunities to grow the breakfast, overnight and family businesses. As value remains paramount to customers in the current environment, we are evolving value offerings and messaging, particularly in key markets like Germany and France. We plan to leverage investments in reimaging, integrated kitchen platforms and other technology-enabled solutions to support the Restaurant Experience of the Future. We are also pursuing refranchising opportunities, new restaurant growth and expanded drive-thru capabilities. We plan to open about 250 new restaurants and reimage approximately 350 existing restaurants in 2015. APMEAIn APMEA, our 2015 initiatives focus on menu variety, value evolution and enhanced convenience. In addition, we are aggressively executing multi-faceted brand recovery efforts in China, Japan and certain other markets. Menu strategies include leveraging core favorites, introducing new flavors particularly in beverages and pursuing opportunities to accelerate the breakfast daypart. Further, customization and personalization is a priority as Australia will be a lead market to roll-out Create Your Taste across the majority of its restaurants in 2015. We will focus on providing customers unparalleled convenience by offering consistent and relevant value options across the menu and expansion of brand extensions, including kiosks, delivery and drive-thrus. Our efforts around reimaging will continue as we expect to modernize approximately 400 existing restaurants. Our plan is to open around 550 new restaurants, with over 200 expected in China. In addition, we will refranchise restaurants to both conventional franchisees and developmental licensees.Consolidated OutlookIn making capital allocation decisions, our goal is to prioritize our spending on initiatives that elevate the McDonald's experience and drive sustainable long-term growth in sales and market share. We focus on markets that generate strong returns or have opportunities for long-term growth. While the Company does not provide specific guidance on diluted earnings per share, the following information is provided to assist in forecasting the Company's future results:▪Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 2 percentage points to 2015 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies), most of which will be due to the 829 net restaurants (981 net traditional openings less 152 net satellite closings) added in 2014.▪The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point change in comparable sales for either the U.S. or Europe would change annual diluted earnings per share by about 4 cents. ▪With about 75% of McDonald's grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Company's commodity costs. For the full year 2015, the total basket of goods cost is expected to increase 1.5-2.5% in the U.S. and Europe.▪The Company expects full-year 2015 selling, general and administrative expenses to increase approximately 7%-8% in constant currencies, primarily due to higher incentive-based compensation reflecting the impact of below target performance in 2014. Excluding the incremental incentive-based compensation, selling, general and administrative expenses would increase approximately 1%-2%, due to costs associated with expansion of the Restaurant Experience of the Future global initiatives, including our digital strategy. Fluctuations between quarters may occur. McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report 15▪Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full-year 2015 to increase slightly compared with 2014. ▪A significant part of the Company's operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 40% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 70% of the Company's operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Company's annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 25 cents.▪The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2015 to be 31% to 33%. Some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate that is outside the annual range. ▪The Company expects capital expenditures for 2015 to be approximately $2.0 billion. About half of this amount will be used to open new restaurants. The Company expects to open more than 1,000 restaurants including about 450 restaurants in affiliated and developmental licensee markets where the Company does not fund any capital expenditures. The Company expects net additions of between 600-700 restaurants. The remaining capital will be used to reinvest in existing locations.▪The Company has established a 3-year cash return target of $18-$20 billion for 2014 to 2016. This target is based on several ongoing factors, including the significant free cash flow generated from our operations, as well as the use of cash proceeds from debt additions and refranchising of at least 1,500 restaurants. 16 McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual ReportConsolidated Operating ResultsOperating results 2014 2013 2012Dollars and shares in millions, except per share data Amount Increase/ (decrease) Amount Increase/ (decrease) AmountRevenues Sales by Company-operated restaurants $18,169 (4%) $18,875 1% $18,603Revenues from franchised restaurants 9,272 0 9,231 3 8,964Total revenues 27,441 (2) 28,106 2 27,567Operating costs and expenses Company-operated restaurant expenses 15,288 (2) 15,579 2 15,224Franchised restaurants-occupancy expenses 1,697 4 1,624 6 1,527Selling, general & administrative expenses 2,488 4 2,386 (3) 2,455Other operating (income) expense, net 19 n/m (247) (2) (244)Total operating costs and expenses 19,4921 19,342 2 18,962Operating income 7,949 (9) 8,764 2 8,605Interest expense 570 9 522 1 517Nonoperating (income) expense, net 7 (82) 38 n/m 9Income before provision for income taxes 7,372 (10) 8,204 2 8,079Provision for income taxes 2,614 0 2,618 0 2,614Net income $4,758 (15%) $5,586 2% $5,465Earnings per common share—diluted $4.82 (13%) $5.55 4% $5.36Weighted-average common shares outstanding—diluted 986.3 (2%) 1,006.0 (1%) 1,020.2n/m Not meaningfulIMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTSWhile changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonald’s mitigates exposures, where practical, by purchasing goods and services in local currencies, financing in local currencies and hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows.In 2014, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results due to the weaker Russian Ruble, Australian Dollar and certain other currencies, partly offset by the stronger British Pound. In 2013, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results due to the weaker Australian Dollar, Japanese Yen and many other foreign currencies, partly offset by the stronger Euro. In 2012, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results primarily due to the weaker Euro, along with most other currencies.Impact of foreign currency translation on reported results Reported amount Currency translation benefit/(cost) In millions, except per share data 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012Revenues $27,441 $28,106 $27,567 $(570) $(29) $(726)Company-operated margins 2,881 3,296 3,379 (60) (7) (97)Franchised margins 7,575 7,607 7,437 (119) (43) (204)Selling, general & administrative expenses 2,488 2,386 2,455 21 (5) 40Operating income 7,949 8,764 8,605 (152) (66) (261)Net income 4,758 5,586 5,465 (114) (52) (178)Earnings per common share—diluted 4.82 5.55 5.36 (0.12) (0.05) (0.17) NET INCOME AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHAREIn 2014, net income decreased 15% (13% in constant currencies) to $4.8 billion and diluted earnings per common share decreased 13% (11% in constant currencies) to $4.82. Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.12 on diluted earnings per share. The following items, which total $0.54 per share, negatively impacted diluted earnings per share by 10% (10% in constant currencies) in 2014:•$0.31 per share due to an increase in tax reserves for 2003-2010 resulting from an unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction, as well as an increase in tax reserves related to audit progression in other foreign tax jurisdictions. •$0.23 per share due to the estimated impact of the previously-disclosed supplier issue in China. In mid-July, food quality issues were discovered at a supplier to McDonald's and other food companies in China. As a consequence, results in China, Japan and certain other markets were negatively impacted due to lost sales and profitability, including expenses associated with customer recovery efforts.Excluding the impact of these items, diluted earnings per share would have been down 3% (1% in constant currencies) compared to 2013. This supplemental information is provided to assist investors in understanding the impact of recent events on the Company's results. McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report 17In 2013, net income increased 2% (3% in constant currencies) to $5.6 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased 4% (4% in constant currencies) to $5.55. Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.05 on diluted earnings per share. Net income and diluted earnings per share growth in constant currencies were positively impacted by higher franchised margin dollars, and to a lesser extent, lower selling, general and administrative expenses. This was partly offset by lower Company-operated margin dollars. The Company repurchased 33.1 million shares of its stock for $3.2 billion in 2014 and 18.7 million shares of its stock for $1.8 billion in 2013, driving reductions in weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods, which positively benefited earnings per share. REVENUESThe Company’s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales, minimum rent payments and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees.In 2014, constant currency revenue was flat compared to the prior year, reflecting the impact of negative comparable sales, partially offset by expansion. In 2013, constant currency revenue growth was due to expansion. Weak comparable sales reflected a muted response to customer-facing initiatives amid a highly competitive and sluggish IEO segment across many markets.Revenues Amount Increase/(decrease) Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation Dollars in millions 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2014 2013Company-operated sales: U.S. $4,351 $4,512 $4,530 (4%) 0% (4%) 0%Europe 7,808 8,138 7,850 (4) 4 0 3APMEA 5,270 5,425 5,350 (3) 1 (2) 2Other Countries & Corporate 740 800 873 (7) (8) (1) (6)Total $18,169 $18,875 $18,603 (4%) 1% (1%) 1%Franchised revenues: U.S. $4,300 $4,339 $4,284 (1%) 1% (1%) 1%Europe 3,270 3,162 2,977 3 6 3 4APMEA 1,054 1,052 1,041 0 1 5 8Other Countries & Corporate 648 678 662 (4) 2 9 8Total $9,272 $9,231 $8,964 0% 3% 2% 3%Total revenues: U.S. $8,651 $8,851 $8,814 (2%) 0% (2%) 0%Europe 11,078 11,300 10,827 (2) 4 1 3APMEA 6,324 6,477 6,391 (2) 1 (1) 3Other Countries & Corporate 1,388 1,478 1,535 (6) (4) 4 0Total $27,441 $28,106 $27,567 (2%) 2% 0% 2% In the U.S., revenues decreased in 2014 due to negative comparable sales, reflecting negative comparable guest counts amid ongoing broad-based challenges, including sustained competitive activity. Revenues were relatively flat in 2013 as the positive impact of expansion was offset by negative comparable sales.Europe's constant currency increase in 2014 reflected a benefit from expansion, primarily in Russia, and positive comparable sales in the U.K, mostly offset by negative comparable sales in Russia and Germany, and refranchising in Germany. The 2013 increase in revenues benefited from expansion, primarily in Russia, and positive comparable sales performance in the U.K. and Russia, the segment's two largest Company-operated restaurant markets, partly offset by negative results in Germany. In APMEA, the constant currency decrease in 2014 was driven by negative comparable sales primarily due to the impact of the supplier issue in China and Japan. Results benefited from expansion, partly offset by refranchising in Australia. The constant currency increase in revenues in 2013 was driven by expansion in China and other markets, partly offset by negative comparable sales, primarily in China.18 McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual ReportThe following tables present comparable sales, comparable guest counts and Systemwide sales increases/(decreases):Comparable sales and guest count increases/(decreases) 2014 2013 2012 Sales GuestCounts Sales GuestCounts Sales GuestCountsU.S. (2.1%) (4.1%) (0.2%) (1.6%) 3.3% 1.9%Europe (0.6) (2.2) 0.0 (1.5) 2.4 (0.5)APMEA (3.3) (4.7) (1.9) (3.8) 1.4 2.2Other Countries & Corporate 6.6 (1.5) 7.0 0.4 7.7 3.0Total (1.0%) (3.6%) 0.2% (1.9%) 3.1% 1.6%In 2014, comparable guest count performance declined 3.6%.

In APMEA, Japan and China accounted for most of the decline in comparable guest count performance, including the impact of the supplier issue. In 2013, comparable guest count performance declined 1.9%. Germany was the main contributor to the decline in Europe and Japan accounted for half of the decline in APMEA.

Franchised margin dollars represented about 70% of the combined restaurant margins in 2014, 2013 and 2012. Franchised margin dollars decreased $32 million or 0% (increased 1% in constant currencies) in 2014, reflecting a benefit from expansion and refranchising, offset by negative comparable sales performance. In 2013, franchised margin dollars increased $170 million or 2% (3% in constant currencies) primarily due to expansion.

The decrease in 2013 was due to higher depreciation related to reimaging and weak comparable sales. McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report 19In Europe, the franchised margin percent decreased in 2014 primarily due to the impact of refranchising and negative comparable sales. The decrease in 2013 was due to higher rent expense in many markets and weak comparable sales primarily due to Germany.In APMEA, the franchised margin percent decreased in 2014 partly due to the negative impact of the supplier issue in Japan, which reduced Japan's favorable contribution to the segment's margin percent. In addition, higher occupancy costs and refranchising negatively impacted the margin percent. The decrease in 2013 was partly due to Japan's negative sales performance and the impact of the weaker Yen. In addition, the segment was negatively impacted by a decline in Australia's results.In connection with our 2014-2016 cash return target, we plan to refranchise at least 1,500 restaurants by selling company-operated restaurants to conventional franchisees and developmental licensees. While this refranchising activity may have a dilutive effect on the franchised margin percent, it results in higher franchised margin dollars. In addition, the franchised margin percent in APMEA and Other Countries & Corporate is higher relative to the U.S. and Europe due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed and/or affiliated restaurants where the Company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs. ▪Company-operated marginsCompany-operated margin dollars represent sales by Company-operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. Company-operated margin dollars decreased $415 million or 13% (11% in constant currencies) in 2014, reflecting weak results across all segments. In 2013, Company-operated margin dollars decreased $83 million or 2% (2% in constant currencies), reflecting weak comparable sales in many markets, which impacted our ability to overcome cost pressures.

The margin percent decreased in 2013 primarily due to higher labor, commodity costs and other operating costs.Europe’s Company-operated margin percent decreased in 2014 reflecting weaker results in Russia and Ukraine, as a challenging operating environment negatively impacted comparable sales performance and weaker currencies impacted imported commodity costs. The margin percent increased in 2013 due to the positive impact of sales performance in Russia, the U.K. and France, mostly offset by higher commodity and occupancy costs. In APMEA, the Company-operated margin percent decreased in 2014 primarily due to the negative impact of the supplier issue in China and certain other markets. The margin percent decreased in 2013 primarily due to higher labor, occupancy and other costs, and negative comparable guest counts, partly offset by a higher average check. SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSESConsolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4% (5% in constant currencies) in 2014 and decreased 3% (3% in constant currencies) in 2013. The increase in 2014 was primarily due to higher employee and other costs, the 2014 Winter Olympics and the Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention, partly offset by a reduction in incentive-based compensation. The decrease in 2013 was due to lower incentive-based compensation, partly offset by higher employee costs. In addition, 2013 benefited from the comparison to costs in 2012 related to the London Olympics and the Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention.Selling, general & administrative expenses Amount Increase/(decrease) Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation Dollars in millions2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2014 2013U.S.$772 $740 $782 4% (5%) 4% (5%)Europe741 703 695 5 1 6 0APMEA387 355 353 9 1 11 1Other Countries & Corporate(1)588 588 625 0 (6) 1 (6)Total$2,488 $2,386 $2,455 4% (3%) 5% (3%)(1)Included in Other Countries & Corporate are home office support costs in areas such as facilities, finance, human resources, information technology, legal, marketing, restaurant operations, supply chain and training.Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues was 9.1% in 2014, 8.5% in 2013 and 8.9% in 2012. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales was 2.8% in 2014, 2.7% in 2013 and 2.8% in 2012. Management believes that analyzing selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales, as well as revenues, is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support the overall McDonald's business.20 McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual ReportOTHER OPERATING (INCOME) EXPENSE, NETOther operating (income) expense, netIn millions2014 2013 2012Gains on sales of restaurant businesses$(137) $(199) $(152)Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates9 (78) (144)Asset dispositions and other expense147 30 52Total$19 $(247) $(244)▪Gains on sales of restaurant businessesThe Company’s purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses on sales of restaurant businesses are recorded in operating income because these transactions are a recurring part of our business. Gains on sales of restaurant businesses decreased in 2014 primarily in Australia, China and the U.S. The increase in 2013 was due primarily to more stores sold in Australia compared to 2012. ▪Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliatesUnconsolidated affiliates and partnerships are businesses in which the Company actively participates, but does not control. The Company records equity in earnings from these entities representing McDonald’s share of results. For foreign affiliated markets—primarily Japan—results are reported after interest expense and income taxes. McDonald’s share of results for partnerships in certain consolidated markets is reported before income taxes. These partnership restaurants are operated under conventional franchise arrangements and, therefore, are classified as conventional franchised restaurants. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased in 2014 and 2013 due to weaker operating results, primarily in Japan. In 2014, Japan's performance was negatively impacted by the supplier issue. ▪Asset dispositions and other expenseAsset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for restaurant closings and uncollectible receivables, asset write-offs due to restaurant reinvestment, and other miscellaneous income and expenses. Asset dispositions and other expense increased in 2014 primarily due to higher asset write-offs and lower other income items in the U.S., and charges related to the supplier issue in China. The decrease in 2013 was due to the favorable resolution of certain liabilities and lower asset retirements, partly offset by lower gains on property sales and unconsolidated partnership dissolutions.

Results for 2013 increased due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses and higher franchised margin dollars, partly offset by lower Company-operated margin dollars.In Europe, results for 2014 decreased primarily due to lower Company-operated margin dollars in Russia and Ukraine, partly offset by higher franchised margin dollars. The year was also negatively impacted by selling, general and administrative expenses associated with the 2014 Winter Olympics. Results for 2013 were driven by higher franchised and Company-operated margin dollars. In APMEA, results for 2014 decreased primarily due to the supplier issue impacting results in China, Japan and certain other markets by an estimated $290 million. Results for 2013 reflected higher franchised margin dollars, mostly offset by lower Company-operated margin dollars.▪Combined operating marginCombined operating margin is defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues. Combined operating margin was 29.0% in 2014 and 31.2% in 2013 and 2012. McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report 21INTEREST EXPENSEInterest expense increased 9% and 1% in 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily due to higher average debt balances.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXESIn 2014, 2013 and 2012, the reported effective income tax rates were 35.5%, 31.9% and 32.4%, respectively.In 2014, the higher effective income tax rate was primarily due to a change in tax reserves for 2003-2010 resulting from an unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction, as well as the impact of changes in tax reserves related to audit progression in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions. Excluding these items, the effective income tax rate would have been 31.4%.In 2013, the effective income tax rate included a tax benefit of nearly $50 million, reflecting the retroactive impact of certain tax benefits as a result of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.In 2012, the effective income tax rate reflected the negative impact of certain tax benefits in the U.S. that had expired at December 31, 2011 and were reinstated retroactively in 2013 as noted above.Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.6 billion in 2014 and $1.5 billion in 2013. Substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the U.S. and other profitable markets.RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance codified in Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 606, ""Revenue Recognition - Revenue from Contracts with Customers,"" which amends the guidance in ASC 605, ""Revenue Recognition,"" and becomes effective beginning January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASC 606.Cash Flows The Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases.Cash provided by operations totaled $6.7 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.1 billion in 2014, while cash provided by operations totaled $7.1 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.3 billion in 2013. In 2014, cash provided by operations decreased $390 million or 5% compared with 2013 primarily due to lower operating results, partly offset by lower income tax payments. In 2013, cash provided by operations increased $155 million or 2% compared with 2012 primarily due to increased operating results. Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.3 billion in 2014, a decrease of $369 million compared with 2013. The decrease primarily reflected lower capital expenditures, a decrease in other investing activities related to short-term time deposits and higher proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses. Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.7 billion in 2013, a decrease of $493 million compared with 2012. The decrease primarily reflected lower capital expenditures and a decrease in other investing activities related to short-term time deposits.Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.6 billion in 2014, an increase of $575 million compared with 2013, primarily due to higher treasury stock purchases, partly offset by an increase in net borrowings. Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.0 billion in 2013, an increase of $193 million compared with 2012, primarily due to lower net debt issuances and higher dividend payments, partly offset by lower treasury stock purchases.The Company’s cash and equivalents balance was $2.1 billion and $2.8 billion at year end 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements.RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURESIn 2014, the Company opened 1,298 traditional restaurants and 18 satellite restaurants (small, limited-menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 317 traditional restaurants and 170 satellite restaurants. In 2013, the Company opened 1,393 traditional restaurants and 45 satellite restaurants and closed 295 traditional restaurants and 194 satellite restaurants. The majority of restaurant openings and closings occurred in the major markets in both years. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure.Systemwide restaurants at year end(1) 2014 2013 2012U.S.14,350 14,278 14,157Europe7,855 7,602 7,368APMEA10,345 9,918 9,454Other Countries & Corporate3,708 3,631 3,501Total36,258 35,429 34,480(1)Includes satellite units at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, as follows: U.S.—919, 973, 997; Europe—273, 261, 246; APMEA (primarily Japan)—641, 733, 871; Other Countries & Corporate—433, 451, 453.Approximately 70% of Company-operated restaurants and nearly 75% of franchised restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2014. Over 80% of the restaurants at year-end 2014 were franchised.22 McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual ReportCapital expenditures decreased $242 million or 9% in 2014, primarily due to lower reinvestment in existing restaurants. Capital expenditures decreased $224 million or 7% in 2013, primarily due to lower reinvestment in existing restaurants, partly offset by higher investment in new restaurants. In both years, the lower reinvestment primarily reflected fewer planned reimages.Capital expenditures invested in major markets, excluding Japan, represented over 70% of the total in 2014, 2013 and 2012. Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts.Capital expenditures In millions2014 2013 2012New restaurants$1,435 $1,473 $1,340Existing restaurants1,044 1,244 1,615Other(1)104 108 94Total capital expenditures$2,583 $2,825 $3,049Total assets$34,281 $36,626 $35,386(1)Primarily corporate equipment and other office-related expenditures.New restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with strong returns or opportunities for long-term growth. Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, and leveraging best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonald’s restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $3.2 million in 2014.The Company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2014 and 2013.SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDSFor 2014 through 2016, the Company expects to return $18 to $20 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, subject to business and market conditions. In 2014, the Company returned approximately $6.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends paid and shares repurchased.Shares repurchased and dividends In millions, except per share data2014 2013 2012Number of shares repurchased33.1 18.7 28.1Shares outstanding at year end963 990 1,003Dividends declared per share$3.28 $3.12 $2.87 Treasury stock purchases (in Shareholders' equity)$3,175 $1,810 $2,605Dividends paid3,216 3,115 2,897Total returned to shareholders$6,391 $4,925 $5,502 In July 2012, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a $10 billion share repurchase program with no specified expiration date (""2012 Program""). In May 2014, the Company's Board of Directors terminated the 2012 program and replaced it with a new share repurchase program, effective July 1, 2014, that authorizes the purchase of up to $10 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date. In 2014, approximately 33.1 million shares were repurchased for $3.2 billion, of which approximately 20.5 million shares or $1.9 billion were repurchased under the new program. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 39 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2014 full year dividend of $3.28 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.81 per share, with an increase to $0.85 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 5% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $3.40 per share annual dividend and reflects the Company’s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors.Financial Position and Capital Resources TOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNSTotal assets decreased $2.3 billion or 6% in 2014. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total assets increased $578 million in 2014. Nearly 80% of total assets were in major markets at year-end 2014. Net property and equipment decreased $1.2 billion in 2014, primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation and depreciation, partly offset by capital expenditures, and represented about 70% of total assets at year end.Operating income is used to compute return on average assets, while net income is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity.Returns on assets and equity 2014 2013 2012Return on average assets21.8% 24.8% 25.4%Return on average commonequity31.3 35.8 37.5In 2014 and 2013, return on average assets and return on average common equity decreased, reflecting lower operating results. Operating income does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. The inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by about two percentage points for all years presented. McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report 23FINANCING AND MARKET RISKThe Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2014 totaled $15.0 billion, compared with $14.1 billion at December 31, 2013. The net increase in 2014 was primarily due to net issuances of $1.5 billion partly offset by changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt of $663 million.Debt highlights(1) 2014 2013 2012Fixed-rate debt as a percent of totaldebt(2,3)74% 74% 74%Weighted-average annual interestrate of total debt(3)4.0 4.0 4.0Foreign currency-denominated debtas a percent of total debt(2)40 41 36Total debt as a percent of totalcapitalization (total debt and totalShareholders' equity)(2)54 47 47Cash provided by operations as apercent of total debt(2)45 50 51(1)All percentages are as of December 31, except for the weighted-average annual interest rate, which is for the year.(2)Based on debt obligations before the effect of fair value hedging adjustments. This effect is excluded as these adjustments have no impact on the obligation at maturity. See Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements.(3)Includes the effect of interest rate swaps.Fitch, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s currently rate, with a stable outlook, the Company’s commercial paper F1, A-1 and P-1, respectively; and its long-term debt A, A and A2, respectively.Certain of the Company’s debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company’s business. Under existing authorization from the Company’s Board of Directors, at December 31, 2014, the Company had $4.5 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $2.5 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and global markets (see Debt Financing note to the consolidated financial statements). Debt maturing in 2015 is approximately $1.1 billion of long-term corporate debt. In 2015, the Company expects to issue commercial paper and long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. As of December 31, 2014, the Company's subsidiaries also had $863 million of borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements.The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $5.9 billion and $5.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See the Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives.The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2014, neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Company’s supplemental benefit plan liabilities where our counterparty was required to post collateral on its liability position.The Company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Company’s largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows:Foreign currency net asset exposuresIn millions of U.S. Dollars2014 2013Euro$4,949 $7,302Australian Dollars2,038 1,933British Pounds Sterling1,460 1,479Canadian Dollars1,231 1,412Japanese Yen640 390The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. Based on the results of these analyses of the Company’s financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2014 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2014 levels would materially affect the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments.LIQUIDITYThe Company has significant operations outside the U.S. where we earn over 60% of our operating income. A significant portion of these historical earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the Company has made, 24 McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Reportand will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations. Accordingly, no U.S. federal or state income taxes have been provided on these undistributed foreign earnings. The Company's cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2014. We do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate these funds.Consistent with prior years, we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, annual repatriation of a portion of the current period's foreign earnings, and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating, investing, and financing activities. We also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating, investing, and financing activities.In the future, should we require more capital to fund activities in the U.S. than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the future.While the likelihood is remote, to the extent foreign cash is available, the Company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (net of an adjustment for foreign tax credits), which could result in a use of cash. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings. Refer to the Income Taxes note to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our income taxes and the undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTSThe Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2014. See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

Debt obligations do not include $5 million of noncash fair value hedging adjustments or $234 million of accrued interest. In the U.S., the Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") limitations. At December 31, 2014, total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $534 million.In addition, total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $988 million at December 31, 2014.There are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business. The amounts related to these commitments are not significant to the Company’s financial position. Such commitments are generally shorter term in nature and will be funded from operating cash flows.Other Matters CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions.The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity:▪Property and equipmentProperty and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.▪Share-based compensationThe Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (""RSUs"") to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period.The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Company’s stock over the expected McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual Report 25life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period.▪Long-lived assets impairment reviewLong-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Company’s long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Company’s experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, the Company does not have any reporting units (defined as each individual country) with risk of material goodwill impairment.▪Litigation accrualsIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made aftercareful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.▪Income taxesThe Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made.The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. In 2014, the Company increased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken in prior years by $505 million, most of which came from foreign-related tax matters. After considering the impact of deferred tax offsets, interest and penalties, these foreign-related tax matters impacted the effective tax rate by 4.1%. See the Income Taxes footnote in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the related tax reconciliations. The most significant new developments in 2014 are described below.In 2014, the Company received an unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction related to exempt income matters. As a result of this new information, the Company changed its judgment on the sustainability of this tax position for 2003-2010 and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of $188 million. The Company intends to pursue all available remedies to defend this tax position.In addition, the Company received new information from tax authorities during the progression of tax audits in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions, including the receipt of proposed tax assessments primarily related to transfer pricing matters. As a result of this new information, the Company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of $207 million. The Company settled certain of these tax audits in 2014 and plans to defend its position with the tax authorities on the remaining audits. Also in 2014, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) concluded its field examination of the Company’s U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. In connection with this examination, the Company agreed to certain adjustments proposed by the IRS. The liabilities previously recorded related to these adjustments were adequate. In connection with this examination, the Company also received notices of proposed adjustments (""NOPAs"") related to certain transfer pricing matters and engaged in audit defense discussions with the IRS. As a result of this new information, the Company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of $38 million. The Company disagrees with these proposed adjustments and will file a protest with the IRS Appeals Office in 2015. While the Company cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the aforementioned tax matters, we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined in accordance with Topic 740 - Income Taxes of the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”). In 2012, the IRS completed its examination of the Company's U.S. federal income tax returns for 2007 and 2008. The Company and the IRS reached an agreement on adjustments that had been previously proposed by the IRS. The agreement did not have a material impact on the Company's cash flows, results of operations or financial position. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $15.4 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If management's intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided.EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES—INFLATIONThe Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation.26 McDonald's Corporation 2014 Annual ReportRECONCILIATION OF RETURNS ON INCREMENTAL INVESTED CAPITALROIIC is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of our markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Company’s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period.The denominator is the weighted-average cash used for investing activities during the applicable one-or three-year period. The weighted-average cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter’s investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2014 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2014 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2013 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full-year impact on 2014 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2013 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). Cash used for investing activities can vary significantly by quarter, resulting in a weighted-average that may be higher or lower than the simple average of the periods presented. Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average.The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one-year and three-year ROIIC are as follows:One-year ROIIC calculation (dollars in millions):Years ended December 31,2014 2013 Increase/(decrease) NUMERATOR: Operating income$7,949.2 $8,764.3 $(815.1)Depreciation and amortization1,644.5 1,585.1 59.4Currency translation(1) 152.0Change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates) $(603.7)DENOMINATOR: Weighted-average cash used forinvesting activities(2) $2,769.2Currency translation(1) (12.2)Weighted-average cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates) $2,757.0One-year ROIIC (21.9)%(1)Represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured.(2)Represents one-year weighted-average cash used for investing activities, determined by applying the weightings below to the cash used for investing activities for each quarter in the two-year period ended December 31, 2014.

63908,MCD,MCDONALDS CORP,2016,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OverviewDESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESSThe Company franchises and operates McDonald’s restaurants. Of the 36,525 restaurants in 119 countries at year-end 2015, 30,081 were franchised (reflects 21,147 franchised to conventional franchisees, 5,529 licensed to developmental licensees and 3,405 licensed to foreign affiliates (""affiliates"")—primarily Japan) and 6,444 were operated by the Company. Under McDonald's conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and décor of their restaurant business, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees enabling restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in the reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants in an effort to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives. Under McDonald's developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market.McDonald's is primarily a franchisor and believes franchising is paramount to delivering great-tasting food, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. Franchising enables an individual to own a restaurant business and maintain control over staffing, purchasing, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the financial strength and global experience of McDonald's. However, directly operating restaurants is important to being a credible franchisor and provides Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. In Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, McDonald's further develops and refines operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that the Company believes are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. McDonald's continually reviews its mix of Company-operated and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance, with a goal to be 95% franchised over the long term.The Company’s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms.Through June 30, 2015, the Company was managed as distinct geographic segments, comprised of the U.S., Europe, Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa and Other Countries & Corporate, which included Canada and Latin America. Beginning July 1, 2015, McDonald’s started operating under a new organizational structure with the following segments that combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth: •U.S. - the Company's largest segment. This segment did not change as a result of the new reporting structure.•International Lead Markets - established markets including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the U.K. and related markets.•High Growth Markets - markets believed to have relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential including China, Italy, Korea, Poland, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, the Netherlands and related markets.•Foundational Markets & Corporate - the remaining markets in the McDonald's system, each of which is believed to have the potential to operate under a largely franchised model. Corporate activities are also reported within this segment.In September 2015, the Company issued segment summary financial information and segment historical data in accordance with its new reporting structure for the previously reported years ended 2010 through 2014 and quarters ended March 31, 2014 through June 30, 2015. The segment information included herein is presented in accordance with the change in reporting structure for all periods presented.For the year ended December 31, 2015, the U.S., International Lead Markets and High Growth Markets segments accounted for 34%, 30% and 24% of total revenues, respectively. In analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth, operating income growth and returns.▪Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases most incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company believes this better represents its underlying business trends.▪Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of the impact of the Company’s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. Typically, pricing has a greater impact on average check than product mix. The goal is to achieve a relatively balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check. ▪Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company’s financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 13▪Return on incremental invested capital (""ROIIC"") is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation.STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEThe strength of the alignment among the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the ""System"") has been key to McDonald's long-term success. By leveraging the System, McDonald’s is able to identify, implement and scale ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. In addition, the Company’s business model enables the System to consistently deliver locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities it serves.In 2015, the Company and its Board of Directors took steps to reset its business and restore growth, which included the election of a new CEO in the first quarter. In May, management announced the initial steps of the Company's turnaround plan, beginning with a worldwide restructuring in July. This resulted in a reorganization from a geographically-focused structure to segments that combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth. This new operating structure is designed to sharpen the Company's focus on the customer, drive greater accountability, and remove distractions and bureaucracy. Management expects the new structure to enable faster decision-making and an increased ability to move proven initiatives quickly across markets.The System is focused on the fundamentals of running great restaurants by providing customers with what matters most to them - hot and fresh food, fast and friendly service, and a contemporary restaurant experience at the value of McDonald’s. In addition, McDonald’s is building on its competitive advantages of convenience, scale, geographic diversification and System alignment that have been created over time.McDonald’s aspires to be viewed by its customers as a modern and progressive burger company delivering a contemporary customer experience. The priorities of the turnaround plan are threefold: drive operational growth, create brand excitement and enhance financial value.To drive operational growth, the Company is working to enhance the quality, choice and variety of its menu. In addition, the Company is building upon investments it has already made in reimaging and technology to innovate the way customers can order and how they are served, which represent elements of the Experience of the Future. While execution and timing of these elements may be different in each market, Experience of the Future is designed to fundamentally enhance McDonald's relationship with customers and their experience with the brand. The Company’s brand efforts aim to reach customers in ways that drive greater excitement and are meaningful to them, such as fun, engaging marketing campaigns and focused support of communities. Enhancements to the quality of McDonald's menu, more local sourcing of ingredients, and commitments around sustainability efforts are all designed to improve consumer confidence in the Brand.The modifications to McDonald’s operating approach are accompanied by strategies to enhance financial value. In 2015, management announced plans to optimize the Company’s restaurant ownership mix by refranchising about 4,000 restaurants through 2018, deliver net annual G&A savings of about $500 million, the vast majority of which is expected to be realized by the end of 2017, and return about $30 billion to shareholders for the three-year period ending 2016.McDonald’s maintains a strong financial foundation supported by industry-leading unit volumes that enable the Company to pursue growth through business and economic cycles while returning significant amounts of cash to shareholders each year. Cash from operations benefits from a heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income received from franchisees provides a stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs and enables co-investment, either through capital expenditures or rent incentives, with franchisees on key initiatives, such as reimaging. In addition, the franchise business model is less capital intensive as franchisees invest in the costs of going into business and most future reinvestment. The Company’s substantial cash flow, strong investment grade credit rating and continued access to credit provides McDonald’s flexibility to fund capital expenditures as well as return cash to shareholders. After a thorough evaluation of financial opportunities, management announced plans to optimize the Company’s capital structure and increased the cash return to shareholders target to about $30 billion for the three-year period ending 2016 - a $10 billion increase over the previous target with incremental debt funding the vast majority of the increase. This proactive move in the Company’s leverage metrics and credit ratings still enables McDonald’s to efficiently and cost effectively access capital globally, while allowing for continued investment in the business. These actions, together with the decision of the Board of Directors to raise the dividend in 2015, reflect the Board and management’s confidence in McDonald's future.The Company’s financial results for 2015 reflect two distinct performance periods. During the first half of the year, the Company took bold and urgent action to reset the business and refocus the System on its customers; however, operating performance was weak. The second half of the year was about execution, with results turning positive and providing tangible evidence that the turnaround plan is working.In McDonald’s heavily franchised business model, growing comparable sales is important to increasing operating income and returns. Global comparable sales increased 1.5% in 2015, driven by positive performance across all segments in the third and fourth quarters. Consolidated guest counts were negative for the year. U.S. comparable sales increased 0.5% and comparable guest counts declined 3.0%, though performance improved sequentially throughout the year with positive comparable sales in the third and fourth quarters.Comparable sales in the International Lead markets grew 3.4% and comparable guest counts increased 1.0%. All major markets contributed to the positive comparable sales performance except France, which was impacted by macro-economic headwinds. In the High Growth markets, comparable sales increased 1.8% and comparable guest counts declined 2.2%. The increase in comparable sales was driven primarily by solid performance in China as the market successfully executed strong recovery plans following the prior year supplier issue. Comparable sales in the Foundational markets increased 0.7% and comparable guest counts declined 3.7%. Solid performance in many markets across Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East were offset by negative comparable sales and guest counts in Japan. 14 McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual ReportRESULTS FOR THE YEAR:•Global comparable sales increased 1.5%, reflecting an increase in all segments. Comparable guest counts declined 2.3%, as positive guest traffic in the International Lead markets was more than offset by negative guest traffic in all other segments. ▪Systemwide sales, a non-GAAP measure that includes franchised sales, decreased 6% (increased 3% in constant currencies).▪Consolidated revenues decreased 7% (increased 3% in constant currencies).▪Consolidated operating income decreased 10% (flat in constant currencies).▪Diluted earnings per share was flat (increased 10% in constant currencies) at $4.80. Results and comparisons were impacted by the following current and prior year items outside normal operations: *Strategic charges, primarily related to goodwill impairment and other asset write-offs in conjunction with the Company's refranchising initiatives, restructuring activities and incremental restaurant closings primarily in China, Japan and the U.S., were partly offset by a gain on sale of property in the U.S. These items had a negative net impact on diluted earnings per share of $0.18 in 2015.*Charges related to certain foreign tax matters and the China supplier issue had a negative impact on diluted earnings per share of $0.54 in 2014.Excluding the impact of these current and prior year items, earnings per share in constant currencies would have reflected an increase of $0.12 or 2% in 2015.▪Cash provided by operations was $6.5 billion.▪One-year ROIIC was 1.5% and three-year ROIIC was negative 3.7% for the period ended December 31, 2015 (see reconciliation on page 28).▪The Company increased the quarterly cash dividend per share 5% to $0.89 for the fourth quarter, equivalent to an annual dividend of $3.56 per share.▪The Company returned $9.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases for the year. This brings the cumulative return to shareholders to $15.8 billion for the two-year period ending 2015 versus the targeted return of about $30 billion for the three-year period ending 2016.▪Capital expenditures of $1.8 billion were split fairly evenly between new restaurant openings and reinvestment in existing restaurants. Across the System, about 1,000 restaurants were opened and over 1,000 existing locations were reimaged.AREAS OF FOCUS BY SEGMENTU.S.As the Company's largest segment, the U.S. remains critical to the Company's turnaround given its significant contribution to consolidated results. While results in the first half of 2015 were weak, the steps taken to enhance menu quality, simplify restaurant operations and offer more convenience to customers led to a meaningful shift in momentum starting in the third quarter. Menu initiatives in the U.S. include enhancing the taste of core products through new cooking procedures and continuing to evolve its menu and ingredients, including the introduction of the Artisan Grilled Chicken and Premium Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Deluxe sandwiches. The October launch of All Day Breakfast built on the positive momentum experienced during the third quarter. McDonald’s ability to move from one test market in April to a national launch in October in over 13,000 restaurants is a testament to the cultural changes the Company is making to become more relevant to customers. The U.S. is placing a renewed emphasis on running great restaurants. This includes simplifying the menu and operations and making it easier for guests to order and interact with the Brand. Customer feedback systems are showing improvements in many important aspects of the customer visit, including food quality, order accuracy, speed and friendliness. The recent launch of McDonald’s mobile app in the U.S. is designed to capture additional demand and engage with customers in more fun, personal and relevant ways. Given the importance of value to its customers, the U.S. is working to establish a consistent national value offering. The goal is to provide customers more choice and flexibility, including the opportunity to bundle their own meals at compelling price points.International Lead MarketsThe International Lead markets remain relentlessly focused on customers and using data insights to better understand and respond to their changing needs and expectations.These markets are focused on food quality, which includes modernizing cooking and service platforms to serve hotter, fresher food. Local market initiatives include new recipes and quality ingredients, such as a range of new Signature Beef products in the U.K. The International Lead markets are working to improve the restaurant experience with a focus on customizing the menu for individual tastes, and offering customers different ways to order, pay for or receive their food. Markets continue to test solutions like self-order kiosks, table service and curbside delivery that help restaurant teams better connect with and serve customers because they simplify operations. These solutions also enable restaurants to accommodate more customers during busy peak times, thereby driving overall business performance.Markets are at different stages, but all are making steady progress towards enhancing the customer experience. France is the furthest along with digital, web ordering, self-order kiosks and table service in the majority of restaurants. Australia's platform focuses on personalization and customization of premium burgers, chicken sandwiches and salads ordered through self-order kiosks. Canada and the U.K. have a number of Experience of the Future restaurants in place today and have plans to deploy more broadly in 2016.The International Lead markets continue to focus on sustainability and social responsibility to become an even more relevant and trusted brand.High Growth MarketsMcDonald's High Growth markets are focused on creating customer excitement through menu, promotions and value, and implementing a digital strategy with specific mobile solutions and actions to build the business and brand trust.In addition to driving operational growth in existing restaurants, targeted new restaurant development and refranchising initiatives are top priorities. New restaurant openings totaled over 400 in 2015, while net additions were over 200. Between 400-500 total openings are planned for 2016, primarily in China, with a strong emphasis on freestanding restaurants with drive-thru’s. The High Growth markets include about half of the System’s planned global openings for 2016. McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 15Foundational MarketsThe Foundational markets span over 80 countries across Asia, Europe, Latin America, Middle East and Africa. This diverse group of markets share common goals of enhancing the critical elements that differentiate McDonald’s - the menu and the customer experience. Menu efforts include emphasizing core favorites and ensuring strong everyday value platforms are in place, complemented by exciting new menu news tailored to local tastes and flavor preferences. The markets are placing a renewed commitment on running great restaurants and increasing convenience to customers, including drive-thru and delivery. The segment is pursuing refranchising opportunities, including the sale of certain markets to developmental licensees. McDonald's is also exploring the sale of a portion of the Company’s ownership in McDonald’s Japan to a strategic investor who could help advance Japan’s turnaround efforts, unlock the market’s growth potential, and enhance value for all stakeholders.OUTLOOK FOR 2016 As McDonald's continues to execute its turnaround plan in 2016, the Company is confident that these strategies will transform customer perceptions of McDonald's as a modern and progressive burger company delivering a contemporary experience. Although some larger markets face challenging headwinds as the Company enters 2016, McDonald's expects continued positive top-line momentum across all segments. McDonald's System is committed to elevating every aspect of the customer experience with the essential imperative of running great restaurants. While the Company does not provide specific guidance on earnings per share, the following global and certain segment-specific information is provided to assist in forecasting the Company’s future results. •Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 1 percentage point to 2016 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies).•The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point change in comparable sales for either the U.S. or the International Lead Markets segment would change annual diluted earnings per share by about 4 cents. •With about 75% of McDonald's grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Company's commodity costs. For the full-year 2016, costs for the total basket of goods are expected to decrease about 1-2% in the U.S. and remain relatively flat in the International Lead Markets segment.•The Company expects full-year 2016 selling, general and administrative expenses to decrease about 1-2% in constant currencies, with fluctuations expected between the quarters. This includes expenses associated with our Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention in second quarter 2016 and sponsorship of the Summer Olympic games in third quarter 2016.•Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full-year 2016 to increase about 40-45% compared with 2015 due to higher average debt balances. •A significant part of the Company's operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 30% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 70% of the Company's operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Company's annual diluted earnings per share would change by up to 25 cents. •The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2016 to be in the 31%-33% range. Some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate outside of the annual range.•The Company expects capital expenditures for 2016 to be approximately $2.0 billion, about half of which will be used to open new restaurants. The Company expects to open about 1,000 restaurants, including about 400 restaurants in affiliated and developmental-licensee markets where the Company does not fund any capital expenditures. The Company expects net additions of about 500 restaurants. The remaining capital will be used to reinvest in existing locations, including about 400 to 500 reimages in the U.S.•The Company plans to optimize its capital structure and expects to return about $30 billion to shareholders for the three-year period ending 2016. The cumulative return for the two years ended 2015 was nearly $16 billion, leaving about $14 billion to be completed in 2016. Some of this remaining amount will be funded by issuing additional debt, of which approximately $6 billion was issued in the fourth quarter 2015. Long-term•The Company expects to refranchise about 4,000 restaurants in the four-year period ending 2018 with a long-term goal to become 95% franchised. The majority of the refranchising will take place in the High Growth and Foundational markets. During 2015, we refranchised about 470 restaurants. •The Company expects to realize net annual G&A savings of about $500 million from our G&A base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015, the vast majority of which is expected to be realized by the end of 2017. These savings will be realized through our refranchising efforts, streamlining resources across corporate, segment and market organizations, primarily in non-customer facing functions, and realizing greater efficiencies in the Company's Global Business Services platform. This target excludes the impact of foreign currency changes. We expect to realize a cumulative total of about $150 million in savings by the end of 2016, with about half of these savings already achieved in 2015. •In connection with executing against our refranchising and G&A targets, we may incur incremental strategic charges associated with asset dispositions and restructuring.16 McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual ReportConsolidated Operating ResultsOperating results 2015 2014 2013Dollars and shares in millions, except per share data Amount Increase/ (decrease) Amount Increase/ (decrease) AmountRevenues Sales by Company-operated restaurants $16,488 (9%) $18,169 (4%) $18,875Revenues from franchised restaurants 8,925 (4) 9,272 0 9,231Total revenues 25,413 (7) 27,441 (2) 28,106Operating costs and expenses Company-operated restaurant expenses 13,977 (9) 15,288 (2) 15,579Franchised restaurants-occupancy expenses 1,647 (3) 1,697 4 1,624Selling, general & administrative expenses 2,434 (2) 2,488 4 2,386Other operating (income) expense, net 209 n/m 19 n/m (247)Total operating costs and expenses 18,267(6) 19,492 1 19,342Operating income 7,146 (10) 7,949 (9) 8,764Interest expense 638 11 576 9 528Nonoperating (income) expense, net (48) n/m 1 n/m 32Income before provision for income taxes 6,556 (11) 7,372 (10) 8,204Provision for income taxes 2,027 (22) 2,614 0 2,618Net income $4,529 (5%) $4,758 (15%) $5,586Earnings per common share—diluted $4.80 0% $4.82 (13%) $5.55Weighted-average common shares outstanding—diluted 944.6 (4%) 986.3 (2%) 1,006.0n/m Not meaningfulIMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTSWhile changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonald’s mitigates exposures, where practical, by purchasing goods and services in local currencies, financing in local currencies and hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows.Foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results in each of the last three years. In 2015, results were negatively impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro, Australian Dollar, Russian Ruble and most other currencies. In 2014, results were negatively impacted by the weaker Russian Ruble, Australian Dollar and certain other currencies, partly offset by the stronger British Pound. In 2013, results were negatively impacted by the weaker Australian Dollar, Japanese Yen and many other foreign currencies, partly offset by the stronger Euro.Impact of foreign currency translation on reported results Reported amount Currency translation benefit/(cost) In millions, except per share data 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013Revenues $25,413 $27,441 $28,106 $(2,829) $(570) $(29)Company-operated margins 2,511 2,881 3,296 (331) (60) (7)Franchised margins 7,278 7,575 7,607 (626) (119) (43)Selling, general & administrative expenses 2,434 2,488 2,386 158 21 (5)Operating income 7,146 7,949 8,764 (771) (152) (66)Net income 4,529 4,758 5,586 (473) (114) (52)Earnings per common share—diluted 4.80 4.82 5.55 (0.50) (0.12) (0.05) NET INCOME AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHAREIn 2015, net income decreased 5% (increased 5% in constant currencies) to $4.5 billion and diluted earnings per common share was flat (increased 10% in constant currencies) at $4.80. Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.50 on diluted earnings per share. In 2014, net income decreased 15% (13% in constant currencies) to $4.8 billion and diluted earnings per common share decreased 13% (11% in constant currencies) to $4.82. Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.12 on diluted earnings per share. Results in 2015 benefited from higher franchised margins and a gain on sale of property in the U.S., partly offset by strategic charges, primarily related to goodwill impairment and other asset write-offs in conjunction with the Company's refranchising initiatives, restructuring and incremental restaurant closings. The strategic charges and gain on sale of property in the U.S. had a negative net impact on diluted earnings per share of $0.18 in 2015.Results in 2014 were negatively impacted by the following items that had a negative impact of $0.54 on diluted earnings per share:•$0.31 per share due to an increase in tax reserves for 2003-2010 resulting from an unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction, as well as an increase in tax reserves related to audit progression in other foreign tax jurisdictions. McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 17•$0.23 per share due to the estimated impact of a supplier issue in China. As a consequence, results in China, Japan and certain other markets were negatively impacted due to lost sales and profitability, including expenses associated with customer recovery efforts.Excluding the impact of these current and prior year items, in 2015 earnings per share in constant currencies would have reflected an increase of $0.12 or 2%. In 2014, diluted earnings per share would have reflected a decrease of 3% (1% in constant currencies) excluding the 2014 charges related to certain foreign tax matters and the China supplier issue. This supplemental information is provided to assist investors in understanding the impact of significant items outside of normal operations.The Company repurchased 61.8 million shares of its stock for $6.2 billion in 2015 and 33.1 million shares of its stock for $3.2 billion in 2014, driving reductions in weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods, which positively benefited earnings per share. REVENUESThe Company’s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales, minimum rent payments and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees.The Company is accelerating the pace of refranchising to optimize its restaurant ownership mix, generate more stable and predictable revenue and cash flow streams, and operate with a less resource-intensive structure. The shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants negatively impacts consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales are replaced by franchised sales, where the Company receives rent and/or royalty revenue based on a percentage of sales.In 2015, constant currency revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales and the benefit from expansion. In 2014, constant currency revenue was flat compared to the prior year, reflecting the impact of negative comparable sales, partially offset by expansion.

Franchised margin dollars represented about 70% of the combined restaurant margins in 2015, 2014 and 2013. In 2015, franchised margin dollars decreased $297 million or 4% (increased 4% in constant currencies). The constant currency increase was due to positive comparable sales performance, expansion and refranchising. In 2014, franchised margin dollars decreased $32 million or 0% (increased 1% in constant currencies), reflecting a benefit from expansion and refranchising, offset by negative comparable sales performance.In connection with the Company's long-term financial targets, the Company plans to refranchise about 4,000 restaurants for the four-year period ending 2018. While this refranchising activity may have a dilutive effect on the franchised margin percent, it typically results in higher franchised margin dollars.Franchised margins Amount% of Revenue Amount% of Revenue Amount% of Revenue Increase/(decrease) Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation Dollars in millions2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2015 2014U.S.$3,60682.7% $3,57283.1% $3,62683.6% 1% (1%) 1% (1%)International Lead Markets2,25480.0 2,48680.1 2,43080.4 (9) 2 6 4High Growth Markets52071.1 55571.7 53173.6 (6) 4 7 4Foundational Markets & Corporate89888.3 96287.7 1,02088.9 (7) (6) 11 3Total$7,27881.5% $7,57581.7% $7,60782.4% (4%) 0% 4% 1%•US: In 2015, the decrease in the franchised margin percent was due to higher occupancy costs.

In 2014, the decrease was due to weaker results in Germany and the negative impact from refranchising, primarily in Germany and Australia, partly offset by positive results in the U.K. •High Growth Markets: In 2015, the decrease in the franchised margin percent was primarily due to the impact from refranchising. In 2014, the decrease was primarily due to negative comparable sales across the segment.The franchised margin percent in Foundational Markets & Corporate is higher relative to the other segments due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed and/or affiliated restaurants where the Company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs. COMPANY-OPERATED MARGINSCompany-operated margin dollars represent sales by Company-operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. In 2015, Company-operated margin dollars decreased $370 million or 13% (1% in constant currencies). In 2014, Company-operated margin dollars decreased $415 million or 13% (11% in constant currencies), reflecting weak results across all segments.Company-operated margins Amount% of Revenue Amount% of Revenue Amount% of Revenue Increase/(decrease) Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation Dollars in millions2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2015 2014U.S.$63215.1% $75617.4% $83018.4% (16%) (9%) (16%) (9%)International Lead Markets96120.0 1,08019.8 1,07919.6 (11) 0 2 1High Growth Markets65912.1 78012.9 1,01916.1 (16) (23) 3 (19)Foundational Markets & Corporate25912.7 26511.5 36814.6 (2) (28) 15 (25)Total$2,51115.2% $2,88115.9% $3,29617.5% (13%) (13%) (1%) (11%)•U.S.: In 2015, the decrease in the Company-operated margin percent was primarily due to the incremental investment in wages and benefits for eligible Company-operated restaurant employees, effective July 1, 2015, designed to improve restaurant performance and enhance our employment proposition.

In 2014, the increase was primarily due to positive results in France, partly offset by weaker results in Germany. •High Growth Markets: In 2015, the decrease in the Company-operated margin percent was primarily due to the negative impact from currency and inflationary pressures in Russia, and higher labor and occupancy costs across the segment. This was partly offset by the benefit from recovery in China from the 2014 supplier issue. In 2014, the decrease was primarily due to the negative impact of the supplier issue in China and weaker results in Russia.20 McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual ReportSELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSESConsolidated selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2% (increased 4% in constant currencies) in 2015 and increased 4% (5% in constant currencies) in 2014. The constant currency increase in 2015 was due to higher incentive-based compensation costs reflecting improved performance, partly offset by lower employee-related costs resulting from the Company's recent restructuring initiatives. The increase in 2014 was primarily due to higher employee and other costs, the 2014 Winter Olympics and the Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention, partly offset by a reduction in incentive-based compensation.Selling, general & administrative expenses Amount Increase/(decrease) Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation Dollars in millions2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2015 2014U.S.$766 $772 $740 (1%) 4% (1%) 4%International Lead Markets534 621 586 (14) 6 (1) 7High Growth Markets326 389 352 (16) 11 (5) 13Foundational Markets & Corporate(1)808 706 708 15 0 20 0Total$2,434 $2,488 $2,386 (2%) 4% 4% 5%(1)Included in Foundational Markets & Corporate are home office support costs in areas such as facilities, finance, human resources, information technology, legal, marketing, restaurant operations, supply chain and training.Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues was 9.6% in 2015, 9.1% in 2014 and 8.5% in 2013. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales was 2.9% in 2015, 2.8% in 2014 and 2.7% in 2013. Management believes that analyzing selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales, as well as revenues, is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support the overall McDonald's business. As a result of the re-categorization of all markets from the prior geographic segments into the new segments, historical market support expenses outside the U.S. were reallocated from the prior geographic segments into the new international segments for all periods presented. Beginning July 1, 2015, the Company centralized certain market support expenses previously incurred by the geographic segments into Corporate. As a result, these expenses were included in the segment results prior to July 1, 2015 and in Corporate results subsequent to that date.OTHER OPERATING (INCOME) EXPENSE, NETOther operating (income) expense, netIn millions2015 2014 2013Gains on sales of restaurant businesses$(146) $(137) $(199)Equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates147 9 (78)Asset dispositions and other (income) expense, net(27) 108 30Impairment and other charges235 39 0Total$209 $19 $(247)▪Gains on sales of restaurant businessesIn 2015, the Company realized higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses, primarily in the U.S., mostly offset by lower gains in China and Australia.

In addition, 2015 results were negatively impacted by restructuring and restaurant closing charges. In 2014, the decrease in results was due to lower restaurant margin dollars, lower other operating income and higher selling, general and administrative expenses.•International Lead Markets: In 2015, the constant currency operating income increase was due primarily to higher franchised margin dollars, benefiting from positive comparable sales performance. In 2014, the constant currency increase was due primarily to higher franchised margin dollars, partly offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses. •High Growth Markets: In 2015, the constant currency operating income increase reflected recovery from the 2014 supplier issue in China and higher franchised margin dollars, partly offset by restaurant closing charges. In 2014, the decrease reflected the negative impact of the supplier issue and lower Company-operated margin dollars in Russia. •Foundational Markets and Corporate: In 2015, the constant currency operating income decrease was due to strategic charges across the segment and weaker results in Japan, as well as higher Corporate selling, general and administrative expenses, including the centralization of certain costs. In 2014, the decrease primarily reflected lower Company-operated margin dollars and weaker operating results in Japan, due in part to the supplier issue.•Operating margin Operating margin is defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues. Operating margin was 28.1% in 2015, 29.0% in 2014 and 31.2% in 2013. INTEREST EXPENSEInterest expense increased 11% (16% in constant currencies) and increased 9% (9% in constant currencies) in 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily due to higher average debt balances.

These items had a negative impact of 4.1% on the effective tax rate. In 2013, the effective income tax rate included a tax benefit of nearly $50 million, reflecting the retroactive impact of certain tax benefits as a result of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.8 billion in 2015 and $1.6 billion in 2014. Substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the U.S. and other profitable markets.RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDSRevenue RecognitionIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued guidance codified in Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 606, ""Revenue Recognition - Revenue from Contracts with Customers,"" which amends the guidance in ASC 605, ""Revenue Recognition."" In July 2015, the FASB made a decision to defer by one year the effective date of its new standard to January 1, 2018, although early adoption is permitted as of January 1, 2017. The new standard allows for either a full retrospective or modified retrospective transition approach. The Company does not believe that the standard will impact its recognition of revenue from company-operated restaurants or its recognition of royalties from restaurants operated by franchisees or licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees, which are based on a percent of sales. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact the adoption of this standard will have on the recognition of other less significant revenue transactions, such as initial fees from franchisees for new restaurant openings or new franchise terms.Cash Flows The Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases.Cash provided by operations totaled $6.5 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.7 billion in 2015, while cash provided by operations totaled $6.7 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.1 billion in 2014. In 2015, cash provided by operations decreased $191 million or 3% compared with 2014, primarily due to lower operating results, including the impact from weaker foreign currencies, and other operating activity. This was partly offset by changes in working capital. In 2014, cash provided by operations decreased $390 million or 5% compared with 2013 primarily due to lower operating results, partly offset by lower income tax payments.Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.4 billion in 2015, a decrease of $885 million compared with 2014. The decrease primarily reflected lower capital expenditures. Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.3 billion in 2014, a decrease of $369 million compared with 2013. The decrease primarily reflected lower capital expenditures, a decrease in other investing activities related to short-term time deposits and higher proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses.Cash provided by financing activities totaled $735 million in 2015, an increase of $5.4 billion compared with 2014, primarily due to an increase in net borrowings, partly offset by higher treasury stock purchases. Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.6 billion in 2014, an increase of $575 million compared with 2013, primarily due to higher treasury stock purchases, partly offset by an increase in net borrowings.The Company’s cash and equivalents balance was $7.7 billion and $2.1 billion at year end 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in 2015 was due to higher net borrowings to be used primarily for share repurchases in 2016. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURESIn 2015, the Company opened 989 restaurants and closed 722 restaurants. In 2014, the Company opened 1,316 restaurants and closed 487 restaurants. The increase in restaurant closings in 2015 reflected a strategic review that resulted in additional closures of under-performing restaurants. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure.Systemwide restaurants at year end 2015 2014 2013U.S.14,259 14,350 14,278International Lead Markets6,802 6,717 6,604High Growth Markets5,266 5,031 4,639Foundational Markets & Corporate10,198 10,160 9,908Total36,525 36,258 35,429Approximately 82% of the restaurants at year-end 2015 were franchised, including 90% in the U.S., 82% in International Lead markets, 46% in High Growth markets and 90% in Foundational markets.Capital expenditures decreased $769 million or 30% in 2015, primarily due to fewer new restaurant openings and lower reinvestment at existing restaurants. Capital expenditures decreased $242 million or 9% in 2014, primarily due to lower reinvestment in existing restaurants. In both years, the lower reinvestment primarily reflected fewer reimages.Capital expenditures invested in the U.S., International Lead markets and High Growth markets represented about 90% of the total in 2015, 2014 and 2013.

Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, and leveraging best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 23for new traditional McDonald’s restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $3.3 million in 2015.The Company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2015 and 2014.SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDSIn 2015, the Company returned approximately $9.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid. This brings the cumulative two-year return to shareholders to $15.8 billion versus our targeted return of about $30 billion for the three-year period ending 2016.

In 2015, approximately 61.8 million shares were repurchased for $6.2 billion, bringing total purchases under the program to $8.1 billion. In December 2015, the Company's Board of Directors terminated the 2014 program and replaced it with a new share repurchase program, effective January 1, 2016, that authorizes the purchase of up to $15 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date.On February 12, 2016, the Company paid $2.7 billion under an Accelerated Share Repurchase agreement and received an initial delivery of 18.5 million shares, which represents 80% of the total shares the Company expects to receive based on the market price at the time of initial delivery. The final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the agreement, between April 1, 2016 and May 13, 2016, will be determined with reference to the volume weighted average price per share of the Company’s common stock over the term of the agreement, less a negotiated discount. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 40 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2015 full year dividend of $3.44 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.85 per share, with an increase to $0.89 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 5% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $3.56 per share annual dividend and reflects the Company’s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors. Financial Position and Capital Resources TOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNSTotal assets increased $3.7 billion or 11% in 2015. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total assets increased $5.8 billion in 2015 primarily due to higher cash and equivalents. Nearly 75% of total assets were in the U.S., International Lead markets and High Growth markets at year-end 2015. Net property and equipment decreased $1.4 billion in 2015, primarily due to the impact of depreciation and foreign currency translation, partly offset by capital expenditures, and represented about 60% of total assets at year end.Operating income is used to compute return on average assets, while net income is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity.Returns on assets and equity 2015 2014 2013Return on average assets20.9% 21.8% 24.8%Return on average common equity45.1 31.3 35.8In 2015, return on average assets decreased primarily due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation on operating income, partly offset by lower average assets, while return on average common equity increased primarily due to lower average common equity as a result of higher treasury stock purchases. In 2014, return on average assets and return on average common equity decreased, reflecting lower operating results. Operating income does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. The inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by about two percentage points for all years presented.FINANCING AND MARKET RISKThe Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2015 totaled $24.1 billion, compared with $15.0 billion at December 31, 2014. The net increase in 2015 was primarily due to net long-term issuances of $9.7 billion in connection with the Company's plans to optimize its capital structure.Debt highlights(1) 2015 2014 2013Fixed-rate debt as a percent of totaldebt(2,3)81% 74% 74%Weighted-average annual interestrate of total debt(3)3.8 4.0 4.0Foreign currency-denominated debtas a percent of total debt(2)29 40 41Total debt as a percent of totalcapitalization (total debt and totalShareholders' equity)(2)77 54 47Cash provided by operations as apercent of total debt(2)27 45 50(1)All percentages are as of December 31, except for the weighted-average annual interest rate, which is for the year.(2)Based on debt obligations before the effects of fair value hedging adjustments and deferred debt costs.

To access the debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit-rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings. Certain of the Company’s debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company’s business. Under existing authorization from the Company’s Board of Directors, at December 31, 2015, the Company had $4.0 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $2.5 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and global markets (see Debt Financing note to the consolidated financial statements). Debt maturing in 2016 is $787 million of long-term corporate debt. The Company plans to issue long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. As of December 31, 2015, the Company's subsidiaries also had $732 million of borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements.The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments.In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $7.0 billion and $5.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See the Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives.The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2015, the Company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to certain derivatives having negative positions. The Company's counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Company’s supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions. The Company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Company’s largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows:Foreign currency net asset exposuresIn millions of U.S. Dollars2015 2014Euro$3,974 $4,949British Pounds Sterling1,333 1,460Australian Dollars1,316 2,038Canadian Dollars1,096 1,231Russian Ruble396 443The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. Based on the results of these analyses of the Company’s financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2015 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2015 levels would materially affect the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments.LIQUIDITYThe Company has significant operations outside the U.S. where we earn about 60% of our operating income. A significant portion of these historical earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the Company has made, and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations. Accordingly, no U.S. federal or state income taxes have been provided on these undistributed foreign earnings. The Company's cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2015. We do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate these funds.Consistent with prior years, we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, annual repatriation of a portion of the current period's foreign earnings, and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating, investing, and financing activities. We also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating, investing, and financing activities.In the future, should we require more capital to fund activities in the U.S. than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the future.While the likelihood is remote, to the extent foreign cash is available, the Company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (net of an adjustment for foreign McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 25tax credits), which could result in a use of cash. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings. Refer to the Income Taxes note to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our income taxes and the undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTSThe Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2015. See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

Debt obligations do not include the impact of noncash fair value hedging adjustments, deferred debt costs, and accrued interest.In the U.S., the Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") limitations. At December 31, 2015, total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $488 million.In addition, total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $781 million at December 31, 2015.There are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business. The amounts related to these commitments are not significant to the Company’s financial position. Such commitments are generally shorter term in nature and will be funded from operating cash flows.Other Matters CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity:▪Property and equipmentProperty and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.▪Share-based compensationThe Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (""RSUs"") to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period.The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Company’s stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period.▪Long-lived assets impairment reviewLong-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Company’s long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Company’s experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, approximately 5-10% of goodwill may be at risk of future impairment as the fair values of certain reporting units were not substantially in excess of their carrying amounts. 26 McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report▪Litigation accrualsIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made aftercareful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.▪Income taxesThe Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made.The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. In 2015, the Company decreased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to settlements with taxing authorities by $258 million. In 2014, the Company increased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken in prior years by $505 million, most of which came from foreign-related tax matters. After considering the impact of deferred tax offsets, interest and penalties, these foreign-related tax matters negatively impacted the effective tax rate by 4.1%. See the Income Taxes footnote in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the related tax reconciliations. The most significant new developments in 2014 and 2015 are described below.In 2014, the Company received an unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction related to exempt income matters. As a result of this new information, the Company changed its judgment on the sustainability of this tax position for 2003-2010 and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of $188 million. In 2015, the Company received an unfavorable decision related to its procedural efforts to appeal the 2014 unfavorable lower tax court ruling. As a result of this new information, the Company agreed to settle the issue for 2003-2008 with the tax authorities and the unrecognized tax benefits were reduced by $143 million. No cash payment was made related to this settlement in 2015 as the Company had previously made a payment to the taxing authority. The settlement did not have a material impact on the Company's cash flows, results of operations or financial position.In 2014, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) concluded its field examination of the Company’s U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. In connection with this examination, the Company agreed to certain adjustments proposed by the IRS. The liabilities previously recorded related to these adjustments were adequate. In early 2015, the IRS issued a Revenue Agent Report for these agreed adjustments and the balance of unrecognized tax benefits was reduced by $102 million. Also in 2014 in connection with the IRS examination of 2009-2010, the Company received notices of proposed adjustments related to certain transfer pricing matters and engaged in audit defense discussions with the IRS. As a result of this new information in 2014, the Company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of $38 million. The Company disagrees with these proposed adjustments and filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office in 2015. The Company expects resolution on these issues in either 2016 or 2017.In 2014, the Company received new information from tax authorities during the progression of tax audits in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions, including the receipt of proposed tax assessments primarily related to transfer pricing matters. As a result of this new information, the Company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of $207 million. The Company settled certain of these tax audits in 2014 and plans to defend its position with the tax authorities on the remaining audits. In 2015, there was no significant progression on these audits.In December 2015, the European Commission opened a formal investigation directly with the Luxembourg government to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. If this matter is adversely resolved, Luxembourg may be required to assess, and the Company may be required to pay, additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase.While the Company cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the aforementioned tax matters, we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined in accordance with Topic 740 - Income Taxes of the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”). Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $14.9 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If management's intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided.EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES—INFLATIONThe Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. McDonald's Corporation 2015 Annual Report 27RECONCILIATION OF RETURNS ON INCREMENTAL INVESTED CAPITALROIIC is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of our markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Company’s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period.The denominator is the weighted-average cash used for investing activities during the applicable one-or three-year period. The weighted-average cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter’s investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2015 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2015 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2014 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full-year impact on 2015 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2014 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). Cash used for investing activities can vary significantly by quarter, resulting in a weighted-average that may be higher or lower than the simple average of the periods presented. Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average.The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one-year and three-year ROIIC are as follows:One-year ROIIC calculation (dollars in millions):Years ended December 31,2015 2014 Increase/(decrease) NUMERATOR: Operating income$7,145.5 $7,949.2 $(803.7)Depreciation and amortization1,555.7 1,644.5 (88.8)Currency translation(1) 919.9Change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates) $27.4DENOMINATOR: Weighted-average cash used forinvesting activities(2) $1,774.7Currency translation(1) 4.1Weighted-average cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates) $1,778.8One-year ROIIC 1.5%(1)Represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured.(2)Represents one-year weighted-average cash used for investing activities, determined by applying the weightings below to the cash used for investing activities for each quarter in the two-year period ended December 31, 2015.

63908,MCD,MCDONALDS CORP,2017,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OverviewDESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESSThe Company franchises and operates McDonald’s restaurants. Of the 36,899 restaurants in 120 countries at year-end 2016, 31,230 were franchised (reflects 21,559 franchised to conventional franchisees, 6,300 licensed to developmental licensees and 3,371 licensed to foreign affiliates (""affiliates"")—primarily Japan) and 5,669 were operated by the Company. Under McDonald's conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and décor of their restaurant business, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company generally owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees enabling restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in the reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants in an effort to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives. Under McDonald's developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company generally has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market.McDonald's is primarily a franchisor and believes franchising is paramount to delivering great-tasting food, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. Franchising enables an individual to be his or her own employer and maintain control over all employment-related matters, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the financial strength and global experience of McDonald's. However, directly operating restaurants is important to being a credible franchisor and provides Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. In Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, McDonald's further develops and refines operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that the Company believes are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. McDonald's continually reviews its mix of Company-operated and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance, with a goal to be approximately 95% franchised over the long term.The Company’s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms.The business is structured into the following segments that combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth, and reflect how management reviews and evaluates operating performance: •U.S. - the Company's largest segment.•International Lead Markets - established markets including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the U.K. and related markets.•High Growth Markets - markets that the Company believes have relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential including China, Italy, Korea, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Spain, Switzerland and related markets.•Foundational Markets & Corporate - the remaining markets in the McDonald's system, each of which the Company believes have the potential to operate under a largely franchised model. Corporate activities are also reported within this segment. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the U.S., International Lead Markets and High Growth Markets accounted for 34%, 29% and 25% of total revenues, respectively. In analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures which are considered to be non-GAAP, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth, return on incremental invested capital (""ROIIC""), free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate, as described below.•Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases most incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company believes this better represents its underlying business trends.•Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of the impact of the Company’s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. Typically, pricing has a greater impact on average check than product mix. The goal is to achieve a relatively balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check. •Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company’s financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.•ROIIC is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report 13foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation.•Free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Company’s ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value. STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The strength of the alignment among the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the ""System"") is key to McDonald's long-term success. By leveraging the System, McDonald’s is able to identify, implement and scale ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. McDonald's continually builds on its competitive advantages of System alignment and geographic diversification to deliver consistent, yet locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers as an integral part of their communities.PROGRESS ON THE COMPANY'S TURNAROUNDThe turnaround plan, introduced in 2015, represented a significant step change in how McDonald's operates and a recommitment to putting customers first. With an aspiration of being recognized by customers as a modern and progressive burger company, the Company prioritized fewer, more strategic initiatives that focused on running better restaurants, driving operational growth, returning excitement to the brand and enhancing financial value. Building on these initial steps, the Company made purposeful changes in 2016. The Company continued to right-size the organization and put the appropriate talent in place by blending executives with deep McDonald’s experience with new executives to generate fresh energy and innovative ideas, while successfully executing against the key elements of its turnaround plan. As reflected by improved customer satisfaction measures across most of the major markets, customers have taken notice.In addition to the customer-relevant changes in the restaurants, the Company has enhanced financial value through its refranchising efforts, cost savings initiatives and cash return to shareholders, as follows:•Refranchising - the Company expects to achieve its refranchising target of 4,000 restaurants by the end of 2017, a full year ahead of the original target date, with a long-term goal to become approximately 95% franchised. Since 2015, the Company has pursued its refranchising goal through the expansion of its conventional franchisee base and the addition of new developmental licensees that bring strong strategic capabilities and financial resources that will enable accelerated expansion and innovation. Moving to a more heavily franchised business model will benefit the Company’s performance over the long term, as the rent and royalty income received from franchisees will provide a more predictable and stable revenue stream with significantly lower operating costs and risks. This model is less capital intensive as franchisees are responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses. •Cost Savings - the Company made meaningful progress towards its goal of reducing net G&A levels by $500 million by the end of 2018 from the Company’s G&A base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. Actions taken in 2015 and 2016, including the redesign of the organization to eliminate layers and increase spans of control, more centralization of non-customer facing business processes and execution against its refranchising targets, have resulted in savings of more than $200 million. •Cash Return to Shareholders - The strength and reliability of the Company's significant and growing free cash flow, strong investment grade credit rating and continued access to credit provide the flexibility to fund capital expenditures as well as return cash to shareholders. By the end of 2016, the Company achieved its three-year target of $30 billion cash return to shareholders. Optimization of the Company's capital structure by adding a meaningful amount of additional debt was instrumental in meeting this target. 2016 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEThe Company's progress in executing the turnaround plan is evident by its stronger business results, including the highest comparable sales growth since 2011. In McDonald’s heavily franchised business model, growing comparable sales is key to increasing operating income and returns. In 2016, global comparable sales increased 3.8%, including positive comparable sales across all segments. Comparable guest counts were negative 0.3%, as positive guest traffic in the Foundational Markets and International Lead Markets was more than offset by negative guest traffic in the U.S. and High Growth Markets. •Comparable sales in the U.S. increased 1.7%, due in part to a higher average check, while comparable guest counts declined 2.1% amidst continued industry softness. The growth in comparable sales was supported by All-Day Breakfast and everyday value under the McPick 2 platform.•Comparable sales in the International Lead Markets increased 3.4% and comparable guest counts increased 1.5%, reflecting solid comparable sales performance across most of the segment, led by the U.K.•In the High Growth Markets, comparable sales increased 2.8%, while comparable guest counts declined 0.8%. The increase in comparable sales reflected positive results across most of the segment, led by China.•Comparable sales in the Foundational Markets increased 10.0% and comparable guest counts increased 1.9%, led by very strong performance in Japan and certain markets in Latin America, as well as solid results across the remainder of the segment.In addition to improved comparable sales performance, the Company achieved the following financial results in 2016:•Consolidated revenues decreased 3% (flat in constant currencies) due to the impact of refranchising, partly offset by positive comparable sales.•Systemwide sales increased 3% (5% in constant currencies).•Consolidated operating income increased 8% (11% in constant currencies).•Operating margin, defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues, increased from 28.1% in 2015 to 31.5% in 2016.•Diluted earnings per share of $5.44 increased 13% (16% in constant currencies). •Cash provided by operations was $6.1 billion.•Capital expenditures of $1.8 billion were allocated mainly to reinvestment in existing restaurants and, to a lesser extent, to new restaurant openings. Across the System, about 900 14 McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Reportrestaurants were opened and over 1,700 existing locations were reimaged.•Free cash flow was $4.2 billion and the Company's free cash flow conversion rate was 90% (see reconciliation in Exhibit 12).•One-year ROIIC was 62.7% and three-year ROIIC was 5.1% for the period ended December 31, 2016 (see reconciliation in Exhibit 12).•The Company increased its quarterly cash dividend per share by 6% to $0.94 for the fourth quarter, equivalent to an annual dividend of $3.76 per share.•The Company returned $14.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases for the year, achieving the Company's targeted return of $30 billion for the three-year period ended 2016. STRATEGIC DIRECTIONBuilding on the momentum established in 2016, the Company is beginning to shift focus from revitalizing the business to longer-term growth. The Company will move with increased velocity to drive sustainable guest count growth, a reliable long-term measure of the Company's strength that is vital to growing the Company’s sales and shareholder value. In order to drive guest count growth in an ever-changing customer environment, the Company developed a customer-centric growth strategy for 2017 and beyond, informed by deep customer research across multiple markets. The Company's greatest opportunities are at the heart of the brand - in its food, value and customer experience - and within defined customer groups. This strategy is built on the following three pillars, which will position McDonald's as a modern and progressive burger company that ""makes delicious, feel good moments easy for everyone.""•Retaining existing customers. The Company will renew its focus on areas where the Company already has a strong foothold in the IEO, including family occasions and food-led breakfast. •Regaining lost customers. The Company plans to regain customers by recommitting to areas of historic strength, namely quality, convenience and value. •Converting casual to committed customers. The Company will focus on building stronger relationships with customers so they visit more often, by elevating and leveraging the McCafé coffee brand and enhancing snack and treat offerings. The Company will continue to build upon its investments in Experience of the Future (""EOTF""), which focuses on restaurant modernization and technology, in order to transform the restaurant service experience. The Company is also accelerating its pursuit of the following two initiatives designed to further drive growth.•Digital. As the Company accelerates its pace of converting restaurants to EOTF, it is placing renewed emphasis on improving its existing service model (i.e., eat in, take out, or drive-thru) and strengthening its relationships with customers through technology. By evolving the technology platform, the Company will simplify how customers order, pay and are served through additional functionality on its global mobile app, self-order kiosks and technology-driven models that enable table service and curb-side pick-up. •Delivery. The Company is accelerating its focus and investment on its delivery platform as a way to expand the convenience customers expect from McDonald's. The Company is conducting various pilot tests in the U.S., Europe and Asia and plans to scale quickly based on results of these pilots.AREAS OF FOCUS BY SEGMENTU.S. While the U.S. has begun to build sales momentum, its greatest opportunity is guest count growth, by focusing on actions that collectively transform the customer experience. A focus on food taste and quality will remain a key priority, including offering the Company's best tasting burger. In 2017, the U.S. is planning to introduce its Signature Crafted offering, a premium platform focused on authentic ingredients that allows customers to customize their sandwiches. In addition, the U.S. will remain focused on strengthening its customer-relevant value proposition.The U.S. expects to launch its mobile order and pay functionality as well as curbside pick-up across all traditional restaurants in the fourth quarter 2017. Further, most of the System's traditional restaurants are expected to be converted to EOTF by 2020. In addition, the U.S. will continue to test its delivery platform.International Lead MarketsThe International Lead Markets are deepening their connection with customers and meeting their changing needs with meaningful enhancements in menu, accessibility and experience. The segment is focused on providing quality, great taste, value and choice across the entire menu. Entry-level value programs appeal to teens and young adults, while other platforms provide budget-conscious customers affordable meal bundles. Programs across the segment are energizing the core menu, and every market has successfully extended into premium chicken and beef with locally relevant offerings. All of this is supported by modernized cooking and service platforms that expand capacity and enable hotter, fresher products. The segment will also remain focused on enhancing and expanding the McCafé coffee brand and pastry offerings. The International Lead Markets continues to lead the McDonald’s System in the development and deployment of EOTF. High Growth MarketsMcDonald’s High Growth Markets have leveraged learnings from the International Lead Markets to enhance the customer experience through design, digital, people, menu innovation and value. In addition to driving operational growth in existing restaurants, targeted new restaurant development and refranchising initiatives are top priorities. In early 2017, the Company announced the planned sale of its businesses in China and Hong Kong to a developmental licensee.Foundational MarketsThe Foundational Markets is a diverse group of markets that share common goals of enhancing the critical elements that differentiate McDonald’s - the menu and the customer experience. The segment is committed to running great restaurants and increasing convenience to customers, including through drive-thru and delivery. The Foundational Markets continue to pursue refranchising opportunities, including the sale of certain markets to developmental licensees. In early 2017, the Company announced the planned sale of its businesses in the Nordic markets (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) to a developmental licensee. McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report 15OUTLOOK 2017 OutlookThe following global and certain segment-specific information is provided to assist in forecasting the Company’s future results. •Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 1 percentage point to 2017 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies). •The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point change in comparable sales for either the U.S. or the International Lead segment would change annual diluted earnings per share by about 4 to 5 cents. •With about 75% of McDonald's grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Company's commodity costs. For the full-year 2017, costs for the total basket of goods are expected to increase about 0.5-1.5% in the U.S. and increase about 2.0% in the International Lead segment. •The Company expects full-year 2017 selling, general and administrative expenses to decrease about 7-8%, in constant currencies with fluctuations expected between the quarters. This includes incentive-based compensation costs of less than $300 million. •Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full-year 2017 to increase about 5-10% compared with 2016 due to higher average debt balances. •A significant part of the Company's operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 35% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 70% of the Company's operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Company's annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 25 cents. •The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2017 to be in the 31-33% range. Some volatility may result in a quarterly tax rate outside of the annual range. •The Company expects capital expenditures for 2017 to be approximately $1.7 billion, about one-third of which will be used to open new restaurants. The Company expects to open about 900 restaurants, including about 500 restaurants in affiliated and developmental licensee markets where the Company generally does not fund any capital expenditures. The Company expects net additions of about 400 restaurants. The remaining two-thirds of capital will be used to reinvest in existing locations, including about 650 reimages in the U.S. When combined with previously modernized restaurants that will be updated with EOTF elements in 2017, we expect to have about 2,500 EOTF restaurants in the U.S. by the end of 2017. Long-Term Outlook•The Company expects to refranchise about 4,000 restaurants in the three-year period ending 2017, with a long-term goal to become approximately 95% franchised.•The Company expects to realize net annual G&A savings of about $500 million from its G&A base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. Through the end of 2016, the Company realized cumulative savings of more than $200 million and expects to realize the majority of its savings target by the end of 2017. Beyond its $500 million reduction, the Company expects to further reduce G&A by 5-10% from the remaining G&A base by the end of 2019. These targets exclude the impact of foreign currency changes. •The Company expects capital expenditures to decline by approximately $500 million from the 2017 level of $1.7 billion, once the U.S. restaurant modernization work is substantially completed. •The Company expects to return between $22 and $24 billion to shareholders for the three-year period ending 2019. This new target contemplates proceeds from future restaurant sales expected under its ongoing refranchising initiative. As the business grows, the Company also expects to modestly increase its debt levels, while maintaining its credit metrics within current ranges. Long-Term Financial TargetsThe Company has established the following long-term, average annual (constant currency) financial targets, beginning in 2019, with variability expected during 2017 and 2018 due to the impact of refranchising: •Systemwide sales growth of 3-5%;•Operating margin in the mid-40% range;•Earnings per share growth in the high-single digits; and•ROIIC in the mid-20% range.16 McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual ReportConsolidated Operating ResultsOperating results 2016 2015 2014Dollars and shares in millions, except per share data Amount Increase/ (decrease) Amount Increase/ (decrease) AmountRevenues Sales by Company-operated restaurants $15,295 (7%) $16,488 (9%) $18,169Revenues from franchised restaurants 9,327 5 8,925 (4) 9,272Total revenues 24,622 (3) 25,413 (7) 27,441Operating costs and expenses Company-operated restaurant expenses 12,699 (9) 13,977 (9) 15,288Franchised restaurants-occupancy expenses 1,718 4 1,647 (3) 1,697Selling, general & administrative expenses 2,384 (2) 2,434 (2) 2,488Other operating (income) expense, net 76 (64) 209 n/m 19Total operating costs and expenses 16,877(8) 18,267 (6) 19,492Operating income 7,745 8 7,146 (10) 7,949Interest expense 885 39 638 11 576Nonoperating (income) expense, net (6) 87 (48) n/m 1Income before provision for income taxes 6,866 5 6,556 (11) 7,372Provision for income taxes 2,180 8 2,027 (22) 2,614Net income $4,686 3% $4,529 (5%) $4,758Earnings per common share—diluted $5.44 13% $4.80 0% $4.82Weighted-average common shares outstanding—diluted 861.2 (9%) 944.6 (4%) 986.3n/m Not meaningfulIMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTSWhile changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonald’s mitigates exposures, where practical, by purchasing goods and services in local currencies, financing in local currencies and hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows.Foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results in each of the last three years. In 2016, results were negatively impacted by the weaker British Pound as well as many other currencies. In 2015, results were negatively impacted by the weaker Euro, Australian Dollar, Russian Ruble and most other currencies. In 2014, results were negatively impacted by the weaker Russian Ruble, Australian Dollar and certain other currencies, partly offset by the stronger British Pound.

Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.11 on diluted earnings per share. In 2015, net income decreased 5% (increased 5% in constant currencies) to $4.5 billion and diluted earnings per common share was relatively flat (increased 10% in constant currencies) at $4.80. Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.50 on diluted earnings per share. Results in 2016 benefited from stronger operating performance and higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses, mostly in the U.S., while results in 2015 benefited from higher franchised margins and a gain on the strategic sale of a unique restaurant property in the U.S. Both 2016 and 2015 results were partly offset by net pre-tax impairment and other charges of $342 million and $307 million, respectively, primarily related to goodwill impairment and other asset write-offs in conjunction with the Company's refranchising initiatives, restructuring and incremental restaurant closings. The 2015 charges combined with the gain on the strategic sale of a unique restaurant property in the U.S. had a net negative impact on diluted earnings per share of $0.18 in 2015, while the 2016 charges had a net negative impact on diluted earnings per share of $0.28 in 2016.The Company repurchased 92.3 million shares of its stock for $11.1 billion in 2016 and 61.8 million shares of its stock for $6.2 billion in 2015, driving reductions in weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods, which positively benefited earnings per share. McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report 17REVENUESThe Company’s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales, minimum rent payments and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees.The Company continues to accelerate the pace of refranchising to optimize its restaurant ownership mix, generate more stable and predictable revenue and cash flow streams, and operate with a less resource-intensive structure. The shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants negatively impacts consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales are replaced by franchised sales, where the Company receives rent and/or royalty revenue based on a percentage of sales.In 2016, revenues decreased 3% (flat in constant currencies) due to the impact of refranchising, partly offset by positive comparable sales. In 2015, revenues decreased 7% (increased 3% in constant currencies), partly due to foreign currency translation. In constant currencies, revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales and the benefit from expansion.Revenues Amount Increase/(decrease) Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation Dollars in millions 2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2016 2015Company-operated sales: U.S. $3,743 $4,198 $4,351 (11%) (4%) (11%) (4%)International Lead Markets 4,278 4,798 5,443 (11) (12) (6) 1High Growth Markets 5,378 5,442 6,071 (1) (10) 4 6Foundational Markets & Corporate 1,896 2,050 2,304 (8) (11) (5) 5Total $15,295 $16,488 $18,169 (7%) (9%) (4%) 2%Franchised revenues: U.S. $4,510 $4,361 $4,300 3% 1% 3% 1%International Lead Markets 2,945 2,817 3,101 5 (9) 8 6High Growth Markets 783 731 774 7 (5) 9 9Foundational Markets & Corporate 1,089 1,016 1,097 7 (7) 11 10Total $9,327 $8,925 $9,272 5% (4%) 6% 5%Total revenues: U.S. $8,253 $8,559 $8,651 (4%) (1%) (4%) (1%)International Lead Markets 7,223 7,615 8,544 (5) (11) (1) 3High Growth Markets 6,161 6,173 6,845 0 (10) 4 6Foundational Markets & Corporate 2,985 3,066 3,401 (3) (10) 1 7Total $24,622 $25,413 $27,441 (3%) (7%) 0% 3% •US: In 2016, the decrease in revenues reflected the impact of refranchising, partly offset by modestly positive comparable sales. In 2015, the decrease reflected the impact of refranchising.•International Lead Markets: In 2016, the decrease in revenues was due to the impact of refranchising, partly offset by strong comparable sales growth across most of the segment. In 2015, revenues decreased due to foreign currency translation. In constant currencies, revenues increased due to positive comparable sales performance, primarily in the U.K., Australia and Canada, partly offset by the impact of refranchising. •High Growth Markets: In 2016 and 2015, revenue growth was negatively impacted by foreign currency translation. In constant currencies, 2016 revenues increased due to positive comparable sales growth in China and most other markets, and continued expansion in Russia. In constant currencies, 2015 revenues increased due to expansion and positive comparable sales, primarily driven by Russia and China.18 McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual ReportThe following tables present comparable sales, comparable guest counts and Systemwide sales increases/(decreases):Comparable sales and guest count increases/(decreases) 2016 2015 2014 Sales GuestCounts Sales GuestCounts Sales GuestCountsU.S. 1.7% (2.1%) 0.5% (3.0%) (2.1%) (4.1%)International Lead Markets 3.4 1.5 3.4 1.0 0.8 (1.2)High Growth Markets 2.8 (0.8) 1.8 (2.2) (2.8) (2.9)Foundational Markets & Corporate 10.0 1.9 0.7 (3.7) (0.1) (4.8)Total 3.8% (0.3%) 1.5% (2.3%) (1.0%) (3.6%)Systemwide sales increases/(decreases) Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation 2016 2015 2016 2015U.S. 2% 1% 2% 1%International Lead Markets 1 (10) 5 5High Growth Markets 3 (7) 6 8Foundational Markets & Corporate 8 (13) 11 3Total 3% (6%) 5% 3%Franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, but are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.

Franchised margin dollars represented about 75% of the combined restaurant margins in 2016, 2015 and 2014. In 2016, franchised margin dollars increased $331 million or 5% (6% in constant currencies). In 2015, franchised margin dollars decreased $297 million or 4% (increased 4% in constant currencies), due to foreign currency translation. For both 2016 and 2015, the constant currency increases were due to positive comparable sales performance, expansion and refranchising.In connection with the Company's refranchising initiatives, the Company expects to refranchise about 4,000 restaurants for the three-year period ending 2017. While this refranchising activity may have a dilutive effect on the franchised margin percent, it typically results in higher franchised margin dollars.Franchised margins Amount% of Revenue Amount% of Revenue Amount% of Revenue Increase/(decrease) Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation Dollars in millions2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2016 2015U.S.$3,72682.6% $3,60682.7% $3,57283.1% 3% 1% 3% 1%International Lead Markets2,36380.2 2,25480.0 2,48680.1 5 (9) 8 6High Growth Markets55070.2 52071.1 55571.7 6 (6) 8 7Foundational Markets & Corporate97089.1 89888.3 96287.7 8 (7) 12 11Total$7,60981.6% $7,27881.5% $7,57581.7% 5% (4%) 6% 4%•U.S.: In 2016 and 2015, the decreases in the franchised margin percent were due to higher occupancy costs, partly offset by positive comparable sales.•International Lead Markets: In 2016, the increase in the franchised margin percent reflected the benefit from positive comparable sales performance, partly offset by higher occupancy costs and the impact of refranchising. In 2015, the slight decrease reflected the benefit from positive comparable sales performance and the negative impact from higher occupancy costs and refranchising. •High Growth Markets: In 2016, the decrease in the franchised margin percent was primarily due to the impact of refranchising and higher occupancy costs, partly offset by the benefit of positive comparable sales performance. In 2015, the decrease was primarily due to the impact of refranchising.The franchised margin percent in Foundational Markets & Corporate is higher relative to the other segments due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed and/or affiliated restaurants where the Company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs. COMPANY-OPERATED MARGINSCompany-operated margin dollars represent sales by Company-operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. In 2016, Company-operated margin dollars increased $85 million or 3% (7% in constant currencies). In 2015, Company-operated margin dollars decreased $370 million or 13% (1% in constant currencies).Company-operated margins Amount% of Revenue Amount% of Revenue Amount% of Revenue Increase/(decrease) Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation Dollars in millions2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2016 2015U.S.$61816.5% $63215.1% $75617.4% (2%) (16%) (2%) (16%)International Lead Markets88620.7 96120.0 1,08019.8 (8) (11) (3) 2High Growth Markets79614.8 65912.1 78012.9 21 (16) 26 3Foundational Markets & Corporate29615.6 25912.7 26511.5 14 (2) 17 15Total$2,59617.0% $2,51115.2% $2,88115.9% 3% (13%) 7% (1%)•U.S.: In 2016, the increase in the Company-operated margin percent was due to a higher average check and lower commodity costs, partly offset by the impact of negative guest counts and higher labor costs. In 2015, the decrease was primarily due to the incremental investment in wages and benefits for eligible Company-operated restaurant employees, effective July 1, 2015, designed to improve restaurant performance and enhance our employment proposition. •International Lead Markets: In 2016 and 2015, the increases in the Company-operated margin percent were primarily due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor and occupancy costs. In 2015, the margin percent also benefited from refranchising efforts. •High Growth Markets: In 2016, the increase in the Company-operated margin percent was primarily due to positive comparable sales and improved restaurant profitability in China, which benefited from recent value-added tax (""VAT"") reform, partly offset by higher labor costs across the segment. In 2015, the decrease was primarily due to the negative impact from currency and inflationary pressures in Russia, and higher labor and occupancy costs across the segment. This was partly offset by the benefit from recovery in China from a 2014 supplier issue.20 McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual ReportSELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSESConsolidated selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2% (1% in constant currencies) in 2016 and decreased 2% (increased 4% in constant currencies) in 2015. The decrease in 2016 was due to lower employee-related costs resulting from the Company's recent restructuring and other cost-saving initiatives, mostly offset by higher incentive-based compensation expenses reflecting improved Company performance. The decrease in 2015 benefited from foreign currency translation. In constant currencies, selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to higher incentive-based compensation costs reflecting improved performance, partly offset by lower employee-related costs resulting from the Company's restructuring initiatives.Selling, general & administrative expenses Amount Increase/(decrease) Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation Dollars in millions2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2016 2015 U.S.$741 $766 $772 (3%) (1%) (3%) (1%) International Lead Markets464 534 621 (13) (14) (10) (1) High Growth Markets294 326 389 (10) (16) (6) (5) Foundational Markets & Corporate(1)885 808 706 10 15 10 20 Total (Selling, General & Administrative Expenses)$2,384 $2,434 $2,488 (2%) (2%) (1%) 4% Less: Incentive-Based Compensation(2)418 317 171 32% 85% 33% 95% Total (Excluding Incentive-Based Compensation)$1,966 $2,117 $2,317 (7%) (9%) (6%)(3) (2%)(4) (1)Included in Foundational Markets & Corporate are home office support costs in areas such as facilities, finance, human resources, information technology, legal, marketing, restaurant operations, supply chain and training.(2)Includes all cash incentives and share-based compensation expense.(3)Excludes $24.8 million of foreign currency benefit.(4)Excludes $142.1 million of foreign currency benefit.Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales was 2.8% in 2016, 2.9% in 2015 and 2.8% in 2014. Management believes that analyzing selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support the overall McDonald's business. In connection with our turnaround plan, the Company established a net selling, general and administrative savings target of $500 million to be achieved by the end of 2018, excluding the effects of any foreign currency changes. These savings represent a reduction of about 20% from our selling, general and administrative base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. This base included incentive-based compensation of approximately $330 million, which assumed achievement of planned operating performance. In 2014, the lower incentive-based compensation reflected nominal payouts for the Company's short-term cash bonus program.

These items had a negative impact of 4.1% on the effective tax rate. Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $2.0 billion in 2016 and $1.8 billion in 2015. Substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the U.S. and other profitable markets.RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDSRecently issued accounting standards are included in Part II, Item 8, page 34 of this Form 10-K.Cash Flows The Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Cash provided by operations totaled $6.1 billion and free cash flow was $4.2 billion in 2016, while cash provided by operations totaled $6.5 billion and free cash flow was $4.7 billion in 2015. In 2016, cash provided by operations decreased $480 million or 7% compared with 2015, primarily due to higher income tax payments primarily outside the U.S. and other working capital changes, partly offset by higher net income. In 2015, cash provided by operations decreased $191 million or 3% compared with 2014 primarily due to lower operating results, including the impact from weaker foreign currencies, and other operating activity, partly offset by changes in working capital.Cash used for investing activities totaled $982 million in 2016, a decrease of $438 million compared with 2015. The decrease primarily reflected higher proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.4 billion in 2015, a decrease of $885 million compared with 2014. The decrease primarily reflected lower capital expenditures.Cash used for financing activities totaled $11.3 billion in 2016, an increase of $12.0 billion compared with 2015, primarily due to a decrease in net borrowings and higher treasury stock purchases. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $735 million in 2015, an increase of $5.4 billion compared with 2014, primarily due to an increase in net borrowings, partly offset by higher treasury stock purchases.The Company’s cash and equivalents balance was $1.2 billion and $7.7 billion at year end 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease was mostly due to higher net borrowings in 2015 that were used for share repurchases in 2016. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURESIn 2016, the Company opened 896 restaurants and closed 522 restaurants. In 2015, the Company opened 989 restaurants and closed 722 restaurants. The increase in restaurant closings in 2015 reflected a strategic review that resulted in additional closures of under-performing restaurants. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure.

Capital expenditures decreased $769 million or 30% in 2015, primarily due to fewer new restaurant openings and lower reinvestment at existing restaurants.Capital expenditures invested in the U.S., International Lead markets and High Growth markets represented over 90% of the total in 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, and leveraging best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonald’s restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $3.4 million in 2016.The Company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2016 and 2015.SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDSIn 2016, the Company returned $14.2 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid, marking the achievement of the Company's targeted return of $30 billion for the three-year period ended 2016.Shares repurchased and dividends In millions, except per share data2016 2015 2014Number of shares repurchased92.3 61.8 33.1Shares outstanding at year end819 907 963Dividends declared per share$3.61 $3.44 $3.28 Treasury stock purchases (in Shareholders' equity)$11,142 $6,182 $3,175Dividends paid3,058 3,230 3,216Total returned to shareholders$14,200 $9,412 $6,391 McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report 23In December 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a $15 billion share repurchase program, effective January 1, 2016, with no specified expiration date. In 2016, approximately 92.3 million shares were repurchased for $11.1 billion under the program.The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 41 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2016 full year dividend of $3.61 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.89 per share, with an increase to $0.94 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 6% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $3.76 per share annual dividend and reflects the Company’s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors.Financial Position and Capital Resources TOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNSTotal assets decreased $6.9 billion or 18% in 2016 primarily due to lower cash and equivalents. Nearly 85% of total assets were in the U.S., International Lead markets and High Growth markets at year-end 2016. Net property and equipment decreased $1.9 billion in 2016, primarily due to the impact of depreciation and the reclass of the assets of China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan markets to assets of businesses held for sale, partly offset by capital expenditures. Net property and equipment represented about 70% of total assets at year end.Operating income and month-end asset balances are used to compute return on average assets. For the years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014, return on average assets was 23.0%, 20.9% and 21.8%, respectively. In 2016, return on average assets increased due to higher operating income and lower average assets. In 2015, return on average assets decreased primarily due to the negative impact of foreign currency translation on operating income, partly offset by lower average assets. Operating income does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. The inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by about three percentage points for all years presented.FINANCING AND MARKET RISKThe Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2016 totaled $26.0 billion, compared with $24.1 billion at December 31, 2015. The net increase in 2016 was primarily due to net long-term issuances of $2.7 billion.Debt highlights(1) 2016 2015 2014Fixed-rate debt as a percent of totaldebt(2,3)82% 81% 74%Weighted-average annual interestrate of total debt(3)3.5 3.8 4.0Foreign currency-denominated debtas a percent of total debt(2)34 29 40Total debt as a percent of totalcapitalization (total debt and totalShareholders' equity)(2)109 77 54Cash provided by operations as apercent of total debt(2)23 27 45(1)All percentages are as of December 31, except for the weighted-average annual interest rate, which is for the year.

To access the debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit-rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings. Certain of the Company’s debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company’s business. Under existing authorization from the Company’s Board of Directors, at December 31, 2016, the Company had $15.0 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $2.5 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and global markets (see Debt Financing note to the consolidated financial statements). Debt maturing in 2017 is $1.6 billion of long-term corporate debt. The Company plans to issue long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's subsidiaries also had $489 million of borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements, of which $297 million is classified in Liabilities of businesses held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet.The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments.In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $8.9 billion and $7.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See the Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives.The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2016, the Company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to negative fair value of certain 24 McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Reportderivative positions. The Company's counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Company’s supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions.The Company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Company’s largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows:Foreign currency net asset exposuresIn millions of U.S. Dollars2016 2015Euro$1,968 $3,974British Pounds Sterling1,340 1,333Australian Dollars1,393 1,316Canadian Dollars1,190 1,096Japanese Yen490 363The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. Based on the results of these analyses of the Company’s financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2016 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2016 levels would materially affect the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments.LIQUIDITYThe Company has significant operations outside the U.S. where we earn about 60% of our operating income. A significant portion of these historical earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the Company has made, and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations. Accordingly, no U.S. federal or state income taxes have been provided on these undistributed foreign earnings. The Company's cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $663 million as of December 31, 2016. We do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate these funds.Consistent with prior years, we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, annual repatriation of a portion of the current period's foreign earnings, and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating, investing, and financing activities. We also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating, investing, and financing activities.In the future, should we require more capital to fund activities in the U.S. than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the future. While the likelihood is remote, to the extent foreign cash is available, the Company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (net of an adjustment for foreign tax credits), which could result in a use of cash. This could also result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings. Refer to the Income Taxes note to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our income taxes and the undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTSThe Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2016. See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

In the U.S., the Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") limitations. At December 31, 2016, total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $465 million.In addition, total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $924 million at December 31, 2016.There are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business, and timing of such payments are not McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report 25estimable or determinable. The amounts related to these commitments are not significant to the Company’s financial position. Such commitments are generally shorter term in nature and will be funded from operating cash flows.Other Matters CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity:•Property and equipmentProperty and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.•Businesses Held for SaleAssets and liabilities of businesses held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet primarily consist of balances related to businesses in China and Hong Kong. In December 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an agreement for the Company to sell its existing businesses in China and Hong Kong, which comprise over 2,600 restaurants, to a developmental licensee organization. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will retain a 20% ownership in the business. The Company expects to complete the sale and licensing transaction mid-year 2017, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, including receipt of any regulatory approvals.Based on approval by the Board of Directors, the Company concluded that these markets were “held for sale” as of December 31, 2016 in accordance with the requirements of ASC 360 “Property, Plant and Equipment”. Accordingly, the Company has ceased recording depreciation expense with respect to the assets of the China and Hong Kong markets effective January 1, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, total assets relating to businesses in China and Hong Kong were $1.3 billion, of which $217 million was current, and total liabilities were $592 million, most of which was current. As a result of this sale, the Company expects to record a gain of approximately $700-$900 million reflecting the difference between the net book value of the businesses and an estimated $1.5 billion of cash proceeds to be received at closing, subject to adjustments.•Share-based compensationThe Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (""RSUs"") to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. The Company estimates forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to be recognized in each period.The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Company’s stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period.•Long-lived assets impairment reviewLong-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Company’s long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Company’s experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, approximately 5-10% of goodwill may be at risk of future impairment as the fair values of certain reporting units were not substantially in excess of their carrying amounts. •Litigation accrualsIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made aftercareful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.26 McDonald's Corporation 2016 Annual Report•Income taxesThe Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made.The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. In 2016, the Company increased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken in prior years by $150 million. In 2015, the Company decreased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to settlements with taxing authorities by $258 million. See the Income Taxes footnote in the consolidated financial statements for the related tax reconciliations. The most significant new developments in 2015 and 2016 are described below.In 2015, the Company received an unfavorable decision related to its procedural efforts to appeal a prior year unfavorable lower tax court ruling in a foreign tax jurisdiction related to exempt income matters. As a result of this new information, the Company agreed to settle the issue for 2003-2008 with the tax authorities and the unrecognized tax benefits were reduced by $143 million. No cash payment was made related to this settlement in 2015 as the Company had previously made a payment to the taxing authority. The settlement did not have a material impact on the Company's cash flows, results of operations or financial position. In 2016, the unrecognized tax benefits related to this issue for 2009-2010 were reduced by $57 million as a result of the lapsing of the statute of limitations.In 2015, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) issued a Revenue Agent Report for certain agreed adjustments related to the Company’s U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010 and the balance of unrecognized tax benefits was reduced by $102 million. Also in 2015, the Company filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office related to certain disagreed transfer pricing matters related to the Company’s U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had not yet received a response to this protest from the IRS. The Company expects resolution on these issues in either 2017 or 2018. In addition, the Company's 2011 and 2012 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently under examination and the completion of the field audit is expected in 2017. In 2016, the Company received new information during the progression of tax audits in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions. As a result of this new information, the Company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits of $125 million. In December 2015, the European Commission opened a formal investigation directly with the Luxembourg government to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. If this matter is adversely resolved, Luxembourg may be required to assess, and the Company may be required to pay, additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. As of December 31, 2016, no decision has been published with respect to this investigation.While the Company cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the aforementioned tax matters, we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined in accordance with Topic 740 - Income Taxes of the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”). Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $16.0 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If management's intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided.EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES—INFLATIONThe Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation.

63908,MCD,MCDONALDS CORP,2018,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OverviewDESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESSThe Company franchises and operates McDonald’s restaurants. Of the 37,241 restaurants in 120 countries at year-end 2017, 34,108 were franchised (reflects 21,366 franchised to conventional franchisees, 6,945 licensed to developmental licensees and 5,797 licensed to foreign affiliates (""affiliates"")—primarily in Japan and China) and 3,133 were operated by the Company. Under McDonald's conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and décor of their restaurant business, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company generally owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees enabling restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in the reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants in an effort to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives. Under McDonald's developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company generally has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a number of affiliates (primarily in Japan and China) that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market.McDonald's is primarily a franchisor and believes franchising is paramount to delivering great-tasting food, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. Franchising enables an individual to be his or her own employer and maintain control over all employment-related matters, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the financial strength and global experience of McDonald's. However, directly operating restaurants is important to being a credible franchisor and provides Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. In Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, McDonald's further develops and refines operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that the Company believes are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. McDonald's continually reviews its mix of Company-operated and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance, with a goal to be approximately 95% franchised over the long term.The Company’s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms.The business is structured into the following segments that combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth, and reflect how management reviews and evaluates operating performance: •U.S. - the Company's largest segment.•International Lead Markets - established markets including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the U.K. and related markets.•High Growth Markets - markets that the Company believes have relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential including China, Italy, Korea, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Spain, Switzerland and related markets.•Foundational Markets & Corporate - the remaining markets in the McDonald's system, most of which operate under a largely franchised model. Corporate activities are also reported within this segment. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the U.S., International Lead Markets and High Growth Markets accounted for 35%, 32% and 24% of total revenues, respectively. In analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures which are considered to be non-GAAP, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth, return on incremental invested capital (""ROIIC""), free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate, as described below.•Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases most incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company believes this better represents its underlying business trends.•Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of the impact of the Company’s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation, and, beginning in 2017, also exclude sales from Venezuela due to its hyper-inflation. Management generally identifies hyper-inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. Typically, pricing has a greater impact on average check than product mix. The goal is to achieve a relatively balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check. •Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company’s financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.•ROIIC is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus 14 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Reportdepreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation.•Free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Company’s ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value. STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The strength of the alignment among the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the ""System"") is key to McDonald's long-term success. By leveraging the System, McDonald’s is able to identify, implement and scale ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. McDonald's continually builds on its competitive advantages of System alignment and geographic diversification to deliver consistent, yet locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers as an integral part of their communities.CUSTOMER-CENTRIC GROWTH STRATEGYBeginning in 2015, the Company made purposeful changes to execute against key elements of its turnaround plan including a renewed focus on running better restaurants, driving operational growth, returning excitement to the brand and enhancing financial value. The Company’s current momentum is broad-based throughout the System and its recent performance demonstrates that McDonald’s has completed the transition from turnaround to growth. In 2017, the Company shifted its focus to delivering long-term growth through accelerated execution of its customer-centric strategy - the Velocity Growth Plan. This plan outlines actions to drive sustainable guest count growth, a reliable long-term measure of the Company's strength, that is vital to growing sales and shareholder value.The Velocity Growth Plan is rooted in extensive customer research and insights, along with a deep understanding of the key drivers of the business. The Company is targeting the tremendous opportunity at the core of its business - its food, value and customer experience. The strategy is built on the following three pillars, all focusing on building a better McDonald’s:•Retaining existing customers - focusing on areas where it already has a strong foothold in the IEO category, including family occasions and food-led breakfast.•Regaining lost customers - recommitting to areas of historic strength, namely food taste and quality, convenience and value.•Converting casual to committed customers - building stronger relationships with customers so they visit more often, by elevating and leveraging the McCafé coffee brand and enhancing snack and treat offerings.In each pillar, McDonald’s has established sustainable platforms that enable execution of the plan with greater speed, efficiency and impact while remaining relentlessly focused on the fundamentals of running great restaurants. Additionally, through three identified growth accelerators - Experience of the Future (“EOTF”), Digital and Delivery - McDonald’s is enhancing the overall customer experience with hospitable, friendly service and ever-improving convenience for customers on their terms. The Company met aggressive deployment targets for each one of these accelerators in 2017 and continues further implementation in 2018 and beyond. •Experience of the Future. The Company continues to build upon its investments in EOTF, focusing on restaurant modernization and technology, in order to transform the restaurant service experience and enhance the brand in the eyes of the customer. The modernization efforts are designed to drive incremental customer visits and higher average check. McDonald’s currently has EOTF deployed in about one-third of the restaurants globally, with half of the U.S. restaurants expected to be deployed by the end of 2018.•Digital. As the Company accelerates its pace of converting restaurants to EOTF, it is placing renewed emphasis on improving its existing service model (i.e., eat in, take out, or drive-thru) and strengthening its relationships with customers through technology. By evolving the technology platform, the Company is expanding choices for how customers order, pay and are served through additional functionality on its global mobile app, self-order kiosks and technology-driven models that enable table service and curb-side pick-up. In the U.S. alone, McDonald’s now has over 20 million registered users of the McDonald’s application. •Delivery. The Company continues to further scale its delivery platform as a way of expanding the convenience customers receive from McDonald's. In 2017, McDonald’s added delivery to 7,000 restaurants in 21 different countries. Including previously offering delivery in Asia and the Middle East, McDonald’s is now delivering meals from over 10,000 restaurants. In addition to added convenience, delivery transactions tend to realize a higher average check and a high customer satisfaction rating. In 2018, while the Company expects to continue to expand the number of restaurants offering delivery, the focus will shift to growing awareness and demand in the areas where delivery is already offered. In 2018, McDonald’s has plans to raise consumer awareness of the enhanced convenience available with delivery and mobile order and pay through thoughtful marketing campaigns that aim to increase the number of customers enjoying these expanded options to engage with the brand. The Company is optimistic that this will contribute to the continued momentum of the business.In addition to the customer-relevant changes in the restaurants, the Company has enhanced financial value through its refranchising efforts, G&A cost savings initiatives and cash return to shareholders. In 2017, the Company achieved its target to refranchise 4,000 restaurants, a full year ahead of the original target date. McDonald’s is currently 92% franchised, with a long-term goal of approximately 95%. The transition to a more heavily franchised business model is benefiting the Company’s performance, as the rent and royalty income received from franchisees provides a more predictable and stable revenue stream with significantly lower operating costs and risks. This includes a less G&A and capital intensive structure as franchisees are responsible for supporting and reinvesting in their businesses. Under this more heavily franchised structure, growing comparable sales will be the strongest driver of operating income growth and returns. Through execution of the Velocity Growth Plan, McDonald’s is serving more customers more often. In 2018, the Company remains aggressively focused on executing its ambitious plan to unlock more of its potential and drive long-term sustainable growth. McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 15Our Velocity Growth Plan also includes the Company doing its part to further embed certain social and environmental issues into the core of our business, which we refer to as our Scale for Good. As one of the world’s largest restaurant companies, our Scale for Good highlights our commitment to global priorities that are consistent with our strategic priorities and provides an opportunity to collaborate with our franchisees and suppliers to drive meaningful progress. We believe it is important for customers to feel good about visiting McDonald’s restaurants and eating our food in order to continue to drive each of the pillars within our strategy.While we're committed to addressing many challenges facing society today, we're elevating a few global priorities that reflect analysis of major social and environmental impacts of our food and our business and the material environmental and social issues that matter most to our customers, employees, franchisees, suppliers and stakeholders. Our four global priorities are: beef sustainability, packaging and recycling, commitment to families and our investment in people. Beyond these global priorities, we will continue to drive progress on our goals and commitments across key social and environmental topics such as climate change, diversity, animal health and welfare, and supporting families and farmers.2017 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEThe Company's 2017 financial performance demonstrates that the Velocity Growth Plan is working. By focusing on the aforementioned three pillars, and the identified growth accelerators, the Company achieved its best comparable sales performance in six years. In 2017, global comparable sales increased 5.3% and global comparable guest counts increased 1.9%, with positive results achieved in all segments.•Comparable sales in the U.S. increased 3.6% and comparable guest counts increased 1.0%. The growth in comparable sales and guest counts was supported by the full breadth of our menu, including national beverage value offerings, strong performance of core menu items featured under the McPick 2 platform as well as Signature Crafted premium sandwiches and other menu innovations.•Comparable sales in the International Lead segment increased 5.3% and comparable guest counts increased 2.3%, reflecting positive performance across all of the segment, led by the U.K. and Canada.•In the High Growth segment, comparable sales increased 5.3% and comparable guest counts increased 1.8%. This performance reflects positive results across most of the segment, led by China.•Comparable sales in the Foundational Markets increased 9.0% and comparable guest counts increased 3.3%, led by strong performance in Japan and Latin America, as well as solid results across the remainder of the segment.In addition to improved comparable sales and guest count performance, the Company achieved the following financial results in 2017:•Consolidated revenues decreased 7% (8% in constant currencies) as positive comparable sales were more than offset by the impact of refranchising.•Systemwide sales increased 7% (7% in constant currencies).•Consolidated operating income increased 23% (23% in constant currencies), which benefited from a gain on the sale of the Company’s businesses in China and Hong Kong. •Operating margin, defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues, increased from 31.5% in 2016 to 41.9% in 2017.•Diluted earnings per share of $6.37 increased 17% (17% in constant currencies). •Cash provided by operations was $5.6 billion.•Capital expenditures of $1.9 billion were allocated mainly to reinvestment in existing restaurants and, to a lesser extent, to new restaurant openings. •Across the System, about 900 restaurants (including those in our developmental licensee and affiliated markets) were opened. •Free cash flow was $3.7 billion (see reconciliation in Exhibit 12). •One-year ROIIC was 1,671.8% and three-year ROIIC was 93.1% for the period ended December 31, 2017. Excluding the gain from the sale of businesses in China and Hong Kong, as well as significant investing cash inflows from strategic refranchising initiatives, one year and three year ROIIC were 48.3% and 43.6%, respectively (see reconciliation in Exhibit 12).•The Company increased its quarterly cash dividend per share by 7% to $1.01 for the fourth quarter, equivalent to an annual dividend of $4.04 per share.•The Company returned $7.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends for the year.16 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual ReportAREAS OF FOCUS BY SEGMENTU.S.The U.S. remains diligent in driving guest count growth momentum in 2018 by continuing to focus on actions that collectively transform the customer experience. With the launch of the $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu in January 2018, the Company is offering a compelling, national value program that resonates with customers. Additionally, an emphasis on food taste and quality will remain a key priority. In 2018, the U.S. is planning to introduce fresh beef across the majority of its restaurants, cooked right when ordered and served hot off the grill for all Quarter Pounder burgers. The U.S. will also offer new seasonal flavors to further expand the McCafé espresso line in 2018, following its successful relaunch of McCafé in 2017.The pace of activity in the U.S. remains accelerated with a focus on increasing customer awareness of its global mobile application, mobile order and pay functionality as well as its delivery platform. Further, the Company is accelerating its investment in EOTF as it expects to complete nearly 4,000 U.S. restaurants in 2018. A majority of traditional restaurants in the U.S. are expected to be substantially complete with EOTF by the end of 2019, offering a holistic, modern experience for customers.International Lead MarketsInternational Lead markets continue to deepen their connection with customers and meet their changing needs with meaningful enhancements in menu, accessibility and experience.The segment is focused on providing quality, great taste, value and choice across the entire menu. Programs across the segment are energizing the core menu, and every market has successfully extended into premium chicken and beef, in addition to locally relevant offerings. All of this is supported by modernized cooking and service platforms that expand capacity and enable hotter, fresher products. Entry-level value programs appeal to teens and young adults, while other platforms provide budget-conscious customers affordable meal bundles. International Lead markets remain focused on enhancing and expanding the McCafé coffee brand and the ongoing deployment of EOTF restaurants across the segment. In addition to EOTF, the continued roll out of delivery provides customers with the high levels of convenience they are seeking. High Growth MarketsMcDonald’s High Growth markets have leveraged ideas around design, digital, people, menu innovation and value from other markets to enhance the customer experience.Driving operational growth in existing restaurants and targeted new restaurant development are top priorities. In 2017, the Company sold its businesses in China and Hong Kong to a licensee. Continued successful integration of the segment’s new licensee into the System will further enable restaurant growth, menu innovation and convenience strategies suited to each market’s customers.Foundational MarketsFoundational markets are a diverse group that share the common goal of enhancing critical elements that differentiate McDonald’s - the menu and the customer experience. The segment is committed to running great restaurants and increasing convenience to customers, including drive-thru and delivery. OUTLOOK 2018 OutlookThe following information is provided to assist in forecasting the Company’s future results.•Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales, net restaurant unit expansion, and the potential impacts of hyper-inflation. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 1 percentage point to 2018 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies). •The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point change in comparable sales for either the U.S. or the International Lead segment would change annual diluted earnings per share by about 5 to 6 cents. •Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the guidance issued in Accounting Standards Codification 606, ""Revenue Recognition - Revenue from Contracts with Customers"". This standard changed the way initial fees from franchisees for new restaurant openings or new franchise terms are recognized. Under the new guidance, initial franchise fees will be recognized evenly over the franchise term. The Company expects the adoption of this guidance to negatively impact 2018 consolidated franchised revenues and franchised margins by approximately $50 million. •With about 75% of McDonald's grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Company's commodity costs. For the full-year 2018, costs for the total basket of goods are expected to increase about 1% to 2% in the U.S. and increase about 2% in the International Lead segment. •The Company expects full-year 2018 selling, general and administrative expenses to decrease about 1% in constant currencies. •Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full-year 2018 to increase about 5% to 7% compared with 2017 due primarily to higher average debt balances. •A significant part of the Company's operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 40% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 70% of the Company's operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Company's annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 30 cents. •The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2018 to be in the 25-27% range, with volatility between the quarters. Certain aspects of the Tax Act are expected to be clarified, and as such, could impact the Company's tax rate.•The Company expects capital expenditures for 2018 to be approximately $2.4 billion. About $1.5 billion will be dedicated to our U.S. business, primarily focused on accelerating the pace of EOTF. We expect to complete EOTF at nearly 4,000 additional U.S. restaurants in 2018, McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 17resulting in about half of the total U.S. restaurants modernized by the end of 2018. Of the remaining capital, about half will be dedicated to new restaurant openings and the remainder will be allocated to reinvestment in continued expansion of EOTF around the world. The Company’s capital will contribute towards about 250 restaurant openings, while developmental licensees and affiliates will contribute capital towards the opening of approximately 750 restaurants, for a total of about 1,000 expected restaurant openings in 2018. The Company expects net additions of about 600 restaurants in 2018. Long-Term Outlook•The Company expects to realize net annual G&A savings of about $500 million from its G&A base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. Through the end of 2017, the Company realized cumulative savings of about $300 million and expects to fully realize its targeted $500 million of net savings in 2019. •The Company expects an incremental cash flow benefit of $400 to $500 million annually as a result of the Tax Act, prior to any reinvestment. •The Company expects to return about $24 billion to shareholders over the three-year period ending 2019. As the business grows, the Company also expects to modestly increase its debt levels, while maintaining its credit metrics within current ranges. •Beginning in 2019, the Company expects to achieve the following long-term, average annual (constant currency) financial targets:◦Systemwide sales growth of 3-5%;◦Operating margin in the mid-40% range;◦Earnings per share growth in the high-single digits; and◦ROIIC in the mid-20% range.18 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual ReportConsolidated Operating ResultsOperating results 2017 2016 2015Dollars and shares in millions, except per share data Amount Increase/ (decrease) Amount Increase/ (decrease) AmountRevenues Sales by Company-operated restaurants $12,719 (17%) $15,295 (7%) $16,488Revenues from franchised restaurants 10,101 8 9,327 5 8,925Total revenues 22,820 (7) 24,622 (3) 25,413Operating costs and expenses Company-operated restaurant expenses 10,410 (18) 12,699 (9) 13,977Franchised restaurants-occupancy expenses 1,789 4 1,718 4 1,647Selling, general & administrative expenses 2,231 (6) 2,384 (2) 2,434Other operating (income) expense, net (1,163) n/m 76 (64) 209Total operating costs and expenses 13,267 (21) 16,877 (8) 18,267Operating income 9,553 23 7,745 8 7,146Interest expense 922 4 885 39 638Nonoperating (income) expense, net 58 n/m (6) 87 (48)Income before provision for income taxes 8,573 25 6,866 5 6,556Provision for income taxes 3,381 55 2,180 8 2,027Net income $5,192 11% $4,686 3% $4,529Earnings per common share—diluted $6.37 17% $5.44 13% $4.80Weighted-average common shares outstanding—diluted 815.5 (5%) 861.2 (9%) 944.6n/m Not meaningfulIMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTSWhile changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonald’s mitigates exposures, where practical, by purchasing goods and services in local currencies, financing in local currencies and hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows.In 2017, results reflected the stronger Euro, offset by the weaker British Pound.

Foreign currency translation had no impact on diluted earnings per share. In 2016, net income increased 3% (6% in constant currencies) to $4.7 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased 13% (16% in constant currencies) to $5.44. Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.11 on diluted earnings per share. Results in 2017 reflected stronger operating performance, G&A savings and improved performance in Japan, which enabled the reversal of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset in Japan. 2017 results included approximately $700 million of net tax cost associated with the Tax Act, reflecting provisional amounts related to the deemed repatriation charge of approximately $1.2 billion, partly offset by a benefit of approximately $500 million resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower enacted U.S. corporate tax rate of 21%. In addition to the $0.82 per share of net tax cost associated with the Tax Act, 2017 results included a net benefit of $0.53 per share consisting of an approximate $850 million gain on the sale of the Company’s businesses in China and Hong Kong, offset in part by $150 million of current year restructuring and non-cash impairment charges in connection with the Company’s global G&A and refranchising initiatives. Excluding the above items, as well as $342 million of prior year strategic charges, net income was $5.4 billion, an increase of 10% (10% in constant currencies), and diluted earnings per share was $6.66, an increase of 16% (16% in constant currencies). Results in 2016 benefited from stronger operating performance and higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses, mostly in the U.S. Results in 2016 included $342 million, or $0.28 per share, of strategic charges. McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 19The Company repurchased 31.4 million shares of its stock for $4.6 billion in 2017 and 92.3 million shares of its stock for $11.1 billion in 2016, driving reductions in weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods, which positively benefited earnings per share.REVENUESThe Company’s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales, minimum rent payments and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees.Between 2015 and 2017, the Company accelerated the pace of refranchising to optimize its restaurant ownership mix, generate more stable and predictable revenue and cash flow streams, and operate with a less resource-intensive structure. The shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants negatively impacts consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales are replaced by franchised sales, where the Company receives rent and/or royalty revenue based on a percentage of sales.In 2017, revenues decreased 7% (8% in constant currencies) and in 2016, revenues decreased 3% (flat in constant currencies). For both periods, the decreases in revenues were due to the impact of refranchising, partly offset by positive comparable sales.Revenues Amount Increase/(decrease) Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation Dollars in millions 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2017 2016Company-operated sales: U.S. $3,260 $3,743 $4,198 (13%) (11%) (13%) (11%)International Lead Markets 4,080 4,278 4,798 (5) (11) (4) (6)High Growth Markets 4,592 5,378 5,442 (15) (1) (17) 4Foundational Markets & Corporate 787 1,896 2,050 (58) (8) (59) (5)Total $12,719 $15,295 $16,488 (17%) (7%) (18%) (4%)Franchised revenues: U.S. $4,746 $4,510 $4,361 5% 3% 5% 3%International Lead Markets 3,260 2,945 2,817 11 5 10 8High Growth Markets 942 783 731 20 7 18 9Foundational Markets & Corporate 1,154 1,089 1,016 6 7 7 11Total $10,102 $9,327 $8,925 8% 5% 8% 6%Total revenues: U.S. $8,006 $8,253 $8,559 (3%) (4%) (3%) (4%)International Lead Markets 7,340 7,223 7,615 2 (5) 1 (1)High Growth Markets 5,533 6,161 6,173 (10) — (13) 4Foundational Markets & Corporate 1,941 2,985 3,066 (35) (3) (35) 1Total $22,820 $24,622 $25,413 (7%) (3%) (8%) —% •US: In 2017 and 2016, the decrease in revenues reflected the impact of refranchising, partly offset by positive comparable sales.•International Lead Markets: In 2017, the increase in revenues was due to strong performance in the U.K. and Canada as well as positive comparable sales across all markets, partly offset by the impact of refranchising. In 2016, the decrease in revenues was due to the impact of refranchising, partly offset by strong comparable sales growth across most of the segment. •High Growth Markets: In 2017, the decrease in revenues reflected the impact of refranchising the Company's businesses in China and Hong Kong, partly offset by positive comparable sales across most markets. In 2016, revenue growth was negatively impacted by foreign currency translation. In constant currencies, 2016 revenues increased due to positive comparable sales growth in China and most other markets, and expansion in Russia.20 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual ReportThe following tables present comparable sales, comparable guest counts and Systemwide sales increases/(decreases):Comparable sales and guest count increases/(decreases) 2017 2016 2015 Sales GuestCounts Sales GuestCounts Sales GuestCountsU.S. 3.6% 1.0% 1.7% (2.1%) 0.5% (3.0%)International Lead Markets 5.3 2.3 3.4 1.5 3.4 1.0High Growth Markets 5.3 1.8 2.8 (0.8) 1.8 (2.2)Foundational Markets & Corporate 9.0*3.3 10.0 1.9 0.7 (3.7)Total 5.3%*1.9% 3.8% (0.3%) 1.5% (2.3%)* Beginning in 2017, the Company excluded sales from markets identified as hyper-inflationary (currently only Venezuela) from the comparable sales calculation as the Company believes this more accurately reflects the underlying business trends.

Franchised margin dollars represented about 80% of the combined restaurant margins in 2017 and about 75% of the combined restaurant margins in 2016 and 2015. In 2017, franchised margin dollars increased $703 million or 9% (9% in constant currencies). In 2016, franchised margin dollars increased $331 million or 5% (6% in constant currencies). For both 2017 and 2016, the constant currency increases were due to positive comparable sales performance, refranchising and expansion.Franchised margins Amount% of Revenue Amount% of Revenue Amount% of Revenue Increase/(decrease) Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation Dollars in millions2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2017 2016U.S.$3,91382.4% $3,72682.6% $3,60682.7% 5% 3% 5% 3%International Lead Markets2,63480.8 2,36380.2 2,25480.0 11 5 10 8High Growth Markets69373.6 55070.2 52071.1 26 6 24 8Foundational Markets & Corporate1,07292.9 97089.1 89888.3 10 8 12 12Total$8,31282.3% $7,60981.6% $7,27881.5% 9% 5% 9% 6%•U.S.: In 2017 and 2016, the decrease in the franchised margin percent was primarily due to higher depreciation costs related to EOTF and restaurant modernization, partly offset by positive comparable sales.•International Lead Markets: In 2017 and 2016, the increases in the franchised margin percent reflected the benefit from positive comparable sales performance, partly offset by the impact of refranchising and higher occupancy costs. •High Growth Markets: In 2017, the increase in the franchised margin percent was due to the impact of refranchising, largely related to the China and Hong Kong transaction, and strong comparable sales performance. In 2016, the decrease was primarily due to the impact of refranchising and higher occupancy costs, partly offset by the benefit of positive comparable sales performance.The franchised margin percent in Foundational Markets & Corporate is higher relative to the other segments due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed and affiliated restaurants where the Company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs. COMPANY-OPERATED MARGINSCompany-operated margin dollars represent sales by Company-operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. In 2017, Company-operated margin dollars decreased $287 million or 11% (12% in constant currencies).

This increase was partly offset by negative comparable sales in South Korea and the impact of refranchising. In 2016, the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales and improved restaurant profitability in China, which benefited from value-added tax (""VAT"") reform, partly offset by higher labor costs across the segment. 22 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual ReportSELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSESConsolidated selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 6% (7% in constant currencies) in 2017 and decreased 2% (1% in constant currencies) in 2016. The decrease in 2017 was due to lower employee-related costs, partly offset by higher restaurant technology spending. The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower employee-related costs, mostly offset by higher incentive-based compensation expenses.Selling, general & administrative expenses Amount Increase/(decrease) Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation Dollars in millions2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2017 2016 U.S.$624 $741 $766 (16%) (3%) (16%) (3%) International Lead Markets451 464 534 (3) (13) (4) (10) High Growth Markets248 294 326 (16) (10) (17) (6) Foundational Markets & Corporate(1)908 885 808 3 10 2 10 Total (Selling, General & Administrative Expenses)$2,231 $2,384 $2,434 (6%) (2%) (7%) (1%) Less: Incentive-Based Compensation(2)336 418 317 (20%) 32% (20%) 33% Total (Excluding Incentive-Based Compensation)$1,895 $1,966 $2,117 (4%) (7%) (4%)(3) (6%)(4) (1)Included in Foundational Markets & Corporate are home office support costs in areas such as facilities, finance, human resources, information technology, legal, marketing, restaurant operations, supply chain and training.(2)Includes all cash incentives and share-based compensation expense.(3)Excludes $9.4 million of foreign currency cost.(4)Excludes $24.8 million of foreign currency benefit.Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales was 2.5% in 2017, 2.8% in 2016 and 2.9% in 2015. Management believes that analyzing selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support the overall McDonald's business. In connection with our turnaround plan, the Company established a net selling, general and administrative savings target of $500 million from its G&A base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. The Company expects to fully realize its targeted $500 million of net savings in 2019.

Excluding these items, operating income increased 17% (15% in constant currencies). In 2016, the increase was driven primarily by improved restaurant profitability in China.•Foundational Markets and Corporate: In 2017, the constant currency operating income increase reflected the Company's refranchising initiatives, higher G&A costs at the Corporate level due to restaurant technology expenditures, and improved performance in Japan, which enabled the reversal of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset in Japan. Results also reflected the benefit from comparison to the prior year's strategic charges.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXESIn 2017, 2016 and 2015, the reported effective income tax rates were 39.4%, 31.7% and 30.9%, respectively.The increase in the tax rate for 2017 reflects provisional amounts related to the deemed repatriation charge of approximately $1.2 billion, partly offset by a benefit of approximately $500 million resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower enacted U.S. corporate tax rate of 21% under the Tax Act. Excluding the impact of the Tax Act, the effective income tax rate would have been 31.6%.Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.5 billion in 2017 and $2.0 billion in 2016. Substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the U.S. and other profitable markets.RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDSRecently issued accounting standards are included in Part II, Item 8, page 36 of this Form 10-K.24 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual ReportCash Flows The Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Cash provided by operations totaled $5.6 billion and free cash flow was $3.7 billion in 2017, while cash provided by operations totaled $6.1 billion and free cash flow was $4.2 billion in 2016. The Company's free cash flow conversion rate was 71% in 2017, and 90% in 2016 (see reconciliation in Exhibit 12). In 2017, cash provided by operations decreased by $508 million or 8% compared with 2016, as improved operating results were more than offset by higher income tax payments in the U.S. and other working capital changes. In 2016, cash provided by operations decreased $480 million or 7% compared with 2015, primarily due to higher income tax payments primarily outside the U.S. and other working capital changes, partly offset by higher net income. Cash provided by investing activities totaled $562 million in 2017, an increase of $1.5 billion compared with 2016. The increase is primarily due to proceeds associated with the sale of the Company's businesses in China and Hong Kong. Cash used for investing activities totaled $982 million in 2016, a decrease of $438 million compared with 2015. The decrease primarily reflected higher proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses.Cash used for financing activities totaled $5.3 billion in 2017, a decrease of $6 billion compared with 2016, primarily due to lower treasury stock purchases, partly offset by a decrease in net borrowings. Cash used for financing activities totaled $11.3 billion in 2016, an increase of $12.0 billion compared with 2015, primarily due to a decrease in net borrowings and higher treasury stock purchases.The Company’s cash and equivalents balance was $2.5 billion and $1.2 billion at year end 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURESIn 2017, the Company opened 929 restaurants and closed 587 restaurants. In 2016, the Company opened 896 restaurants and closed 522 restaurants. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure.Systemwide restaurants at year end 2017 2016 2015U.S.14,036 14,155 14,259International Lead Markets6,921 6,851 6,802High Growth Markets5,884 5,552 5,266Foundational Markets & Corporate10,400 10,341 10,198Total37,241 36,899 36,525More than 90% of the restaurants at year-end 2017 were franchised, including 94% in the U.S., 87% in International Lead Markets, 81% in High Growth Markets and 98% in Foundational Markets.Capital expenditures were relatively flat in 2017 as higher expenditures on restaurant reinvestment were offset by fewer restaurant openings that required the Company's capital. Under McDonald's developmental licensee and affiliate arrangements, licensees provide capital for the entire business and the Company generally has no capital invested. Capital expenditures in 2016 were essentially flat with 2015, primarily due to higher reinvestment related to reimages, offset by fewer new restaurant openings. Capital expenditures invested in the U.S., International Lead markets and High Growth markets represented over 90% of the total in 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, and leveraging best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonald’s restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $3.9 million in 2017.The Company owned 45% to 50% of the land and 70% to 75% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2017 and 2016.SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDSFor 2017 through 2019, the Company expects to return about $24 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, subject to business and market conditions. In 2017, the Company returned approximately $7.7 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid.Shares repurchased and dividends In millions, except per share data2017 2016 2015Number of shares repurchased31.4 92.3 61.8Shares outstanding at year end794 819 907Dividends declared per share$3.83 $3.61 $3.44 Treasury stock purchases (in Shareholders' equity)$4,651 $11,142 $6,182Dividends paid3,089 3,058 3,230Total returned to shareholders$7,740 $14,200 $9,412In December 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved a $15 billion share repurchase program with no specified expiration date (""2016 Program""). In July 2017, the Company's Board of Directors terminated the 2016 Program and replaced it with a new share repurchase program, effective July 28, 2017, that authorizes the purchase of up to $15 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date. In 2017, approximately 31.4 million shares were repurchased for $4.7 billion, of which approximately 17.3 million shares or $2.7 billion were repurchased under the new program.The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 42 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2017 full-year dividend of $3.83 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.94 per share, with an increase to $1.01 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 7% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 25$4.04 per share annual dividend and reflects the Company’s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors.Financial Position and Capital Resources TOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNSTotal assets increased $2.8 billion or 9% in 2017 primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rates and an increase in cash and equivalents, partly offset by the impact of refranchising. Approximately 85% of total assets were in the U.S., International Lead markets and High Growth markets at year-end 2017. Net property and equipment increased $1.2 billion in 2017, primarily due to capital expenditures and the impact of foreign exchange rates, partly offset by depreciation and the impact of refranchising. Net property and equipment represented about 65% of total assets at year-end.Operating income and month-end asset balances are used to compute return on average assets. For the years ended 2017, 2016 and 2015, return on average assets was 29.0%, 23.0% and 20.9%, respectively. In 2017, return on average assets increased primarily due to higher operating income, which included the gain on the sale of the Company's businesses in China and Hong Kong. In 2016, return on average assets increased due to higher operating income and lower average assets. Operating income does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. The inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by about three percentage points for all years presented. FINANCING AND MARKET RISKThe Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2017 totaled $29.5 billion, compared with $26.0 billion at December 31, 2016. The net increase in 2017 was primarily due to net long-term issuances of $3.1 billion.Debt highlights(1) 2017 2016 2015Fixed-rate debt as a percent of totaldebt(2,3)89% 82% 81%Weighted-average annual interestrate of total debt(3)3.3 3.5 3.8Foreign currency-denominated debtas a percent of total debt(2)42 34 29Total debt as a percent of totalcapitalization (total debt and totalShareholders' equity)(2)112 109 77Cash provided by operations as apercent of total debt(2)19 23 27(1)All percentages are as of December 31, except for the weighted-average annual interest rate, which is for the year.(2)Based on debt obligations before the effects of fair value hedging adjustments and deferred debt costs.

To access the debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit-rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings. Certain of the Company’s debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company’s business. Under existing authorization from the Company’s Board of Directors, at December 31, 2017, the Company had $15.0 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $2.5 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and global markets (see Debt Financing note to the consolidated financial statements). Debt maturing in 2018 is $1.8 billion of long-term corporate debt. The Company plans to issue long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's subsidiaries also had $268 million of borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements.The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments.26 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual ReportIn managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $12.4 billion and $8.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See the Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives.The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2017, the Company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to negative fair value of certain derivative positions. The Company's counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Company’s supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions.The Company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Company’s largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows:Foreign currency net asset exposuresIn millions of U.S. Dollars2017 2016British Pounds Sterling$1,877 $1,340Australian Dollars1,519 1,393Canadian Dollars733 1,190Japanese Yen589 490Russian Ruble563 470The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. Based on the results of these analyses of the Company’s financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2017 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2017 levels would materially affect the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments.LIQUIDITYThe Company has significant operations outside the U.S. where we earn about 60% of our operating income. A significant portion of these historical earnings have been reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the Company has made, and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations.The Company's cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2017. Consistent with prior years, we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, annual repatriation of a portion of the current period's foreign earnings, and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating, investing, and financing activities. We also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating, investing, and financing activities. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company expects an incremental cash flow benefit of $400 to $500 million annually due to a reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% partly offset by a $1.2 billion 2017 tax cost on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings that will be paid over the next 8 years.In the future, should we require more capital to fund activities in the U.S. than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTSThe Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2017. See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

Debt obligations do not include the impact of noncash fair value hedging adjustments, deferred debt costs, and accrued interest.In the U.S., the Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") limitations. At December 31, 2017, total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $484 million.At December 31, 2017, total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $1.2 billion. In addition, a liability of approximately $1.2 billion was recorded in 2017 resulting from the McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 27Tax Act, which imposed a deemed repatriation tax on the Company's undistributed foreign earnings. This tax liability will be paid over eight years beginning in 2018. There are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business. Such commitments are generally shorter term in nature, will be funded from operating cash flows, and are not significant to the Company’s overall financial position.Other Matters CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity:•Property and equipmentProperty and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.•Businesses Held for SaleAssets and liabilities of businesses held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016 primarily consisted of balances related to businesses in China and Hong Kong. In December 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an agreement for the Company to sell its existing businesses in China and Hong Kong to a licensee. Based on this approval, the Company concluded that these markets were “held for sale” as of December 31, 2016 in accordance with the requirements of ASC 360 “Property, Plant and Equipment”. The Company completed the sale of these businesses on July 31, 2017.•Share-based compensationThe Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (""RSUs"") to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. The Company estimates forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to be recognized in each period.The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Company’s stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. For performance-based RSUs granted beginning in 2016, the Company includes a relative Total Shareholder Return (""TSR"") modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. The fair value of performance-based RSUs that include the TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model.•Long-lived assets impairment reviewLong-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Company’s long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Company’s experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, approximately 5-10% of goodwill may be at risk of future impairment as the fair values of certain reporting units were not substantially in excess of their carrying amounts. •Litigation accrualsIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made aftercareful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.•Income taxesThe Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a 28 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Reportcharge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made.The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. The most significant new developments in 2017 and 2016 are described below.In 2017 and 2016, the Company increased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken in prior years by $144 million and $150 million, respectively. These increases primarily resulted from the evaluation of new information during the progression of tax audits in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions. As a result of this new information, the Company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits. See the Income Taxes footnote in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the related tax reconciliations. In 2015, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) issued a Revenue Agent Report (“RAR”) that included certain disagreed transfer pricing adjustments related to the Company’s U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. Also in 2015, the Company filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters. During 2017, the Company received a response to its protest, and, as of December 31, 2017, is awaiting scheduling of an opening conference with IRS Appeals. The Company expects resolution on these issues in either 2018 or 2019.In 2017, the IRS completed its examination of the Company’s U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. Although at December 31, 2017 the IRS had not yet issued its RAR for these years, when issued it is expected to result in the same disagreed transfer pricing matters as the 2009 and 2010 RAR. Consequently, it is expected that the transfer pricing matters for 2011 and 2012 will be addressed along with the 2009 and 2010 matters as part of the 2009-2010 appeal, such that resolution is expected in either 2018 or 2019.In December 2015, the European Commission opened a formal investigation directly with the Luxembourg government to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. If this matter is adversely resolved, Luxembourg may be required to assess, and the Company may be required to pay, additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. As of December 31, 2017, no decision has been published with respect to this investigation.While the Company cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the aforementioned tax matters, we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined in accordance with Topic 740 - Income Taxes of the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”). The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. At December 31, 2017, the Company has not completed the accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Act. However, as described below, the Company has made a reasonable estimate of the effects on the existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. For these items, a provisional net tax cost of approximately $700 million is recognized and is included as a component of provision for income taxes from continuing operations. Provisional amounts Deferred tax assets and liabilities: The Company remeasured certain U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. However, the Company is still analyzing certain aspects of the Tax Act and refining the calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. A provisional amount was recorded related to the remeasurement of the deferred tax balance, resulting in a provision for income taxes benefit of approximately $500 million. Foreign tax effects: The one-time transition tax is based on the total post-1986 earnings and profits (""E&P"") that the Company had previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. A provisional amount was recorded for the one-time transition tax liability, resulting in a provision for income taxes cost of approximately $1.2 billion. The Company has not yet completed the calculation of the total post-1986 foreign E&P. Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. This amount may change when the calculation of post-1986 foreign E&P and the amounts held in cash or other specified assets are finalized. Additionally, the provisional amount includes an estimate of foreign withholding taxes related to the E&P subject to the transition tax. A provisional deferred tax liability has been recorded for temporary differences related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. However, the Company is still evaluating how the Tax Act will affect the Company’s accounting position related to the indefinite reinvestment of unremitted foreign earnings. During the measurement period, the Company may reflect adjustments to this provisional amount upon obtaining, preparing, and analyzing the necessary information to complete the accounting under ASC 740.EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES—INFLATIONThe Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation.

63908,MCD,MCDONALDS CORP,2019,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OverviewDESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESSThe Company operates and franchises McDonald’s restaurants. Of the 37,855 restaurants in 120 countries at year-end 2018, 35,085 were franchised. Under McDonald’s conventional franchise arrangement, the Company generally owns the land and building or secures a long-term lease for the restaurant location and the franchisee pays for equipment, signs, seating and décor. The Company believes that ownership of real estate, combined with the co-investment by franchisees, enables us to achieve restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry.Franchisees are also responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses over time. In addition, to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives, the Company frequently co-invests with franchisees to fund improvements to their restaurants or their operating systems. These investments, developed in collaboration with franchisees are designed to cater to consumer preferences, improve local business performance, and increase the value of our brand through the development of modernized, more attractive and higher revenue generating restaurants.Under McDonald's developmental license or affiliate arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company generally has no capital invested. The Company also has an equity investment in a limited number of foreign affiliates (primarily in China and Japan).McDonald's is primarily a franchisor and believes franchising is paramount to delivering great-tasting food, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. Franchising enables an individual to be his or her own employer and maintain control over all employment-related matters, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of McDonald's global brand, operating system and financial resources. Directly operating McDonald’s restaurants contributes significantly to our ability to act as a credible franchisor. One of the strengths of the franchising model is that the expertise from operating Company-owned restaurants allows McDonald’s to improve the operations and success of all restaurants while innovations from franchisees can be tested and, when viable, efficiently implemented across relevant restaurants. Having Company-owned and operated restaurants provides Company personnel with a venue for restaurant operations training experience. In addition, in our Company-owned and operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we are able to further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies that will ultimately benefit McDonald’s restaurants. McDonald's continually reviews its mix of Company-operated and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance, with a goal to be approximately 95% franchised over the long term.The Company’s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from developmental licensees and affiliate restaurants include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new license. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms.Through the end of 2018, the business was structured into the following segments that combined markets with similar characteristics and ownership structure, and reflected how management reviewed and evaluated operating performance:•U.S. - the Company's largest segment.•International Lead Markets - established markets including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the U.K. and related markets.•High Growth Markets - markets that the Company believes have relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential including China, Italy, Korea, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Spain, Switzerland and related markets.•Foundational Markets & Corporate - the remaining markets in the McDonald's system, most of which operate under a largely franchised model. Corporate activities are also reported within this segment.Beginning in 2019, the Company changed its global operating structure as detailed in the Company's Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 24, 2018. Refer to the Strategic Direction and Financial Performance section on the next page for additional information as well as the Segment and Geographic Information section included in Part II, Item 8, page 49 of this Form 10-K.MANAGEMENT'S VIEW OF THE BUSINESSIn analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures which are considered to be non-GAAP, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth, return on incremental invested capital (""ROIIC""), free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate, as described below.•Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases most incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company believes this better represents its underlying business trends.•Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of the impact of the Company’s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation, and, beginning in 2017, also exclude sales from Venezuela due to its hyper-inflation. Management generally identifies hyper-inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 15inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. Typically, pricing has a greater impact on average check than product mix. The goal is to achieve a relatively balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check. •Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company’s financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.•ROIIC is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation.•Free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Company’s ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value. STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The strength of the alignment among the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the ""System"") is key to McDonald's long-term success. By leveraging the System, McDonald’s is able to identify, implement and scale ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. McDonald's continually builds on its competitive advantages of System alignment and geographic diversification to deliver consistent, yet locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers as an integral part of their communities.In 2018, the Company continued to evolve to a more heavily franchised business model, and is currently about 93% franchised, with a long-term goal of approximately 95%. The Company will continue to make progress toward this long-term goal in 2019 primarily by refranchising restaurants to conventional licensees. As a result of the continued evolution of the Company’s business model, in September 2018, the Company announced several organizational changes to its global business structure. These changes are designed to continue the Company's efforts toward efficiently driving growth as a better McDonald’s through the Velocity Growth Plan. Effective January 1, 2019, McDonald’s is operating with the following global business segments: •U.S., the Company's largest market.•International Operated Markets (IOM), comprised of wholly-owned markets, or countries in which the Company operates restaurants, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, Spain and the U.K.•International Developmental Licensed Markets (IDL), comprised primarily of developmental licensee and affiliate markets in the McDonald’s system. Corporate activities will also be reported within this segment.Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the U.K. may be collectively referred to as “the Big Five international markets” in the Company’s disclosures.CUSTOMER-CENTRIC GROWTH STRATEGYThe Velocity Growth Plan (the ""Plan""), the Company’s customer-centric strategy, is rooted in extensive customer research and insights, along with a deep understanding of the key drivers of the business. The Plan is designed to drive sustainable guest count growth, which is a reliable long-term measure of the Company's strength and is vital to growing sales and shareholder value. 2018 was a year of broad-based strength around the world along with significant execution against the Plan in the U.S. While the Company made meaningful progress, our focus in 2019 will be to optimize execution of the Plan to unlock further potential and drive long-term sustainable growth.The Company continues to target the opportunity at the core of its business - its food, value and customer experience. The strategy is built on the following three pillars, all focusing on building a better McDonald’s:•Retaining existing customers - focusing on areas where it already has a strong foothold in the IEO category, including family occasions and food-led breakfast.•Regaining customers who visit less often - recommitting to areas of historic strength, namely food taste and quality, convenience and value.•Converting casual to committed customers - building stronger relationships with customers so they visit more often, by elevating and leveraging the McCafé coffee brand and enhancing snack and treat offerings.In each pillar, McDonald’s has established sustainable platforms that enable execution of the Plan with greater speed, efficiency and impact while remaining relentlessly focused on the fundamentals of running great restaurants. Additionally, through three identified growth accelerators - Experience of the Future (“EOTF”), digital and delivery - McDonald’s is enhancing the overall customer experience with hospitable, friendly service and ever-improving convenience for customers on their terms. The Company worked to aggressively deploy each of these accelerators in 2018 and will continue further implementation in 2019 and beyond. McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 16•Experience of the Future. The Company continues to build upon its investments in EOTF, focusing on restaurant modernization and technology in order to transform the restaurant service experience and enhance the brand in the eyes of our customers. EOTF introduces a new hospitality experience via the restaurant Guest Experience Leaders and table service, both of which have proven to be critical drivers of customer satisfaction. The modernization efforts are designed to provide a better customer experience, leading to increased frequency of customer visits along with higher average check. As of the end of 2018, EOTF is now deployed in about half of the restaurants in our global system, and in 2019, the Company will continue to deploy EOTF in many markets. In 2018, the U.S. converted about 4,500 restaurants to EOTF, exceeding its ambitious target of 4,000 restaurants, resulting in over half of the U.S. restaurants now having EOTF. We expect to convert substantially all of the restaurants in the U.S. to EOTF by the end of 2020.•Digital. As the Company continues its ambitious pace of converting restaurants to EOTF, it is placing renewed emphasis on improving its existing service model (i.e., eat in, take out, or drive-thru) and strengthening its relationships with customers through technology. By evolving the technology platform, the Company is redefining how we provide convenience to customers by expanding choices for how customers order, pay and are served through additional functionality on its global mobile app, self-order kiosks, and technologies that enable conveniences such as table service and curb-side pick-up. In 2018, the Company made further progress in rolling out digital platforms to improve convenience for our customers and provide a simpler and more personalized experience. This included having kiosks deployed in nearly 17,000 restaurants, digital menu boards in more than 21,000 restaurants, and availability of Mobile Order & Pay in over 22,000 restaurants. The popularity and utilization of self-order kiosks continues to grow over time, and in France, Italy and Spain, well over half of all in-restaurant visits orders are placed through the kiosk. Germany made a strong push to grow digital engagement in 2018 through digital calendar promotions, and saw success, driving sales and guest count growth, as well as increased app downloads. In 2019, the Company will continue to utilize digital initiatives to engage customers, grow awareness and adoption of digital offerings, and support our menu offerings.•Delivery. The Company continues to build momentum with its delivery platform as a way of expanding the convenience for its customers. In 2018, McDonald’s expanded the number of restaurants offering delivery and it is now available in over half of the global system. Customers are responding positively, as demonstrated by high satisfaction ratings, high reorder rates, and average checks that are 1.5-2 times higher than average non-delivery transactions. In addition, many of our larger markets, such as the U.S., France and the U.K., have achieved delivery sales growth in the high double digits in restaurants offering the service for more than 12 months. Further, in several of our top markets, delivery now represents as much as 10% of sales in those restaurants offering delivery. While growing customer awareness remains a priority and focus in 2019, we have been effective in markets like Australia, where awareness has more than doubled through a major campaign that promoted delivery with in-restaurant signs, engaging social media outreach, public relations activity and advertising.The Velocity Growth Plan is a global strategy that is tailored at a market level to allow for the best customer experience and most convenience for our valued customers. While the Plan provides a consistent framework on how to retain, regain, and convert customers, the execution varies across the globe. Markets continue to make progress on the three pillars of the Plan and its growth accelerators. The U.S., for example, remains diligently focused on driving guest count growth in 2019 through actions that collectively transform the customer experience. In addition to continuing its aggressive execution of the growth accelerators of EOTF, digital and delivery, the U.S. will also enhance the customer experience through strong restaurant execution, with a focus on the drive thru experience, and reducing complexity in the restaurants. In 2018, several markets, including key markets outside of the U.S., experienced strong business results, driven by the Velocity Growth Plan, and the markets will continue to hone their execution of the Plan in 2019, focusing on value, quality and convenience.Our Plan also includes the Company further embedding actions in response to certain social and environmental issues into the core of our business, which we refer to as using our Scale for Good. As one of the world’s largest restaurant companies, our Scale for Good highlights our commitment to global priorities that are consistent with our strategic priorities and provides an opportunity to collaborate with our franchisees and suppliers to drive meaningful progress. We recognize that our success in advancing each of the pillars within our strategy will be demonstrated as customers continue to feel good about visiting McDonald’s restaurants and eating our food.While we're committed to working to address many challenges facing society today, we are elevating a few global priorities where we believe we can make the greatest difference in driving industry-wide change. Our four global priorities reflect the social and environmental impacts of our food and our business and are: beef sustainability, packaging and recycling, commitment to families and our investment in people. In 2018, the Company demonstrated its dedication to these priorities, pledging commitments related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the use of antibiotics, sourcing sustainable packaging, and making a difference for families through our food offerings, reading programs and Ronald McDonald House Charities.The Company is confident that, with the Velocity Growth Plan in place, the System will work together in 2019 to focus on improving the taste of our delicious food, enhancing convenience, offering compelling value and upholding the trust consumers place in our brand, which we believe will enhance our ability to deliver long-term sustainable growth. McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 172018 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEThe Company's 2018 financial performance continued to demonstrate that the Velocity Growth Plan is working. By focusing on the aforementioned three pillars, and the identified growth accelerators, the Company has achieved 14 consecutive quarters of positive global comparable sales. In 2018, global comparable sales increased 4.5% and global comparable guest counts increased 0.2%.•Comparable sales in the U.S. increased 2.5% and comparable guest counts decreased 2.2%. The increase in comparable sales was driven by growth in average check resulting from both product mix shifts and menu price increases.•Comparable sales in the International Lead segment increased 5.8% and comparable guest counts increased 2.4%, reflecting positive results across all markets.•Comparable sales in the High Growth segment increased 4.1% and comparable guest counts increased 1.8%. This performance reflects positive results across most of the segment, led by strong performance in Italy and the Netherlands.•Comparable sales in the Foundational Markets increased 7.1% and comparable guest counts increased 1.5%, reflecting positive sales performance in Japan and across all geographic regions.In addition to improved comparable sales and consolidated guest count performance, the Company achieved the following financial results in 2018:•Due to the impact of the Company's strategic refranchising initiative, consolidated revenues decreased 8% (8% in constant currencies).•Systemwide sales increased 6% (6% in constant currencies).•Consolidated operating income decreased 8% (8% in constant currencies). 2018 results included non-cash impairment and strategic restructuring charges. 2017 results reflected a gain on the sale of the Company's businesses in China and Hong Kong, partly offset by restructuring and impairment charges. Excluding these items in both years, consolidated operating income increased 2% (2% in constant currencies).•Operating margin, defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues, increased from 41.9% in 2017 to 42.0% in 2018. Excluding the items described in the previous bullet point, operating margin increased from 38.8% in 2017 to 43.1% in 2018.•Diluted earnings per share of $7.54 increased 18% (18% in constant currencies). Refer to the Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share section on page 21 for additional details.•Cash provided by operations was $6.97 billion.•Capital expenditures of $2.74 billion were allocated mainly to reinvestment in existing restaurants and, to a lesser extent, to new restaurant openings.•Free cash flow was $4.23 billion.•Across the System, about 1,100 restaurants (including those in our developmental licensee and affiliated markets) were opened. •One-year ROIIC was (80.4%) and three-year ROIIC was 78.0% for the period ended December 31, 2018. Excluding the gain from the sale of businesses in China and Hong Kong, as well as significant investing cash inflows from strategic refranchising initiatives, one year and three year ROIIC were 10.2% and 34.7%, respectively (see reconciliation in Exhibit 12).•The Company increased its quarterly cash dividend per share by 15% to $1.16 for the fourth quarter, equivalent to an annual dividend of $4.64 per share. •The Company returned $8.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends for the year and increased the cash return to shareholder target for the 3-year period ending 2019 to about $25 billion.OUTLOOK 2019 OutlookThe following information is provided to assist in forecasting the Company’s future results.•Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales, net restaurant unit expansion and the potential impacts of hyper-inflation. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 1 percentage point to 2019 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies). •The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point change in comparable sales for either the U.S. or the new International Operated Markets segment would change annual diluted earnings per share by about 6 to 7 cents. •With about 75% of McDonald's grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Company's commodity costs. For the full year 2019, costs for the total basket of goods are expected to increase about 1% to 2% in the U.S. and about 2% in the Big Five international markets. •The Company expects full year 2019 selling, general and administrative expenses to decrease about 4% in constant currencies. McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 18•Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full year 2019 to increase about 10% to 12% due primarily to higher average debt balances. •A significant part of the Company's operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 40% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 80% of the Company's operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Company's annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 35 cents. •The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full year 2019 to be in the 24% to 26% range. Some volatility may result in a quarterly tax rate outside of the annual range. Primarily due to tax costs associated with new regulations issued in January 2019, the effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2019 is expected to be in the 28% to 29% range.•The Company expects capital expenditures for 2019 to be approximately $2.3 billion. About $1.5 billion will be dedicated to our U.S. business, nearly two-thirds of which is allocated to approximately 2,000 EOTF projects. Globally, we expect to open roughly 1,200 restaurants. We will spend approximately $600 million in our wholly owned markets to open 300 restaurants and our developmental licensee and affiliated markets will contribute capital toward the remaining 900 restaurant openings in their respective markets. The Company expects about 750 net restaurant additions in 2019.•During 2019, the Company expects to return about $9 billion to shareholders, which will complete its cash return to shareholder target of about $25 billion for the 3-year period ending 2019.Long-Term Outlook•Over the long-term, the Company expects to achieve the following average annual (constant currency) financial targets:◦Systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5%;◦Operating margin in the mid-40% range;◦Earnings per share growth in the high-single digits; and◦Return on incremental invested capital in the mid-20% range.

In 2017, results reflected the stronger Euro, offset by the weaker British Pound. In 2016, results were negatively impacted by the weaker British Pound as well as many other currencies.Impact of foreign currency translation on reported results Reported amount Currency translation benefit/(cost) In millions, except per share data 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016Revenues $21,025 $22,820 $24,622 $123 $186 $(692)Company-operated margins 1,747 2,309 2,596 4 17 (89)Franchised margins 9,039 8,312 7,609 57 25 (118)Selling, general & administrative expenses 2,200 2,231 2,384 (13) (10) 28Operating income 8,823 9,553 7,745 56 28 (173)Net income 5,924 5,192 4,686 33 2 (97)Earnings per common share—diluted 7.54 6.37 5.44 0.04 — (0.11) McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 20NET INCOME AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHAREIn 2018, net income increased 14% (13% in constant currencies) to $5.9 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased 18% (18% in constant currencies) to $7.54. Foreign currency translation had a positive impact of $0.04 on diluted earnings per share. In 2017, net income increased 11% (11% in constant currencies) to $5.2 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased 17% (17% in constant currencies) to $6.37. Foreign currency translation had no impact on diluted earnings per share.Results in 2018 reflected a lower effective tax rate, and stronger operating performance due to an increase in sales-driven franchised margin dollars, partly offset by lower Company-operated margin dollars due to the impact of refranchising. Results in 2017 reflected stronger operating performance, G&A savings, improved performance in Japan, and the benefit of a reversal of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset in Japan.Included in the full year 2018 results were:◦approximately $140 million, or $0.17 per share, of non-cash impairment charges;◦pre-tax strategic restructuring charges of $94 million, or $0.09 per share (of which $85 million relates to the restructuring of the U.S. business); and◦approximately $75 million, or $0.10 per share, of net tax cost associated with 2018 adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded in the prior year under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""Tax Act"").Included in the full year 2017 results were:◦approximately $700 million, or $0.82 per share, of net tax cost associated with the Tax Act; and◦a pre-tax gain of approximately $850 million on the sale of the Company’s businesses in China and Hong Kong, offset in part by $150 million of restructuring and impairment charges in connection with the Company’s global G&A and refranchising initiatives, for a net benefit of $0.53 per share.Excluding these 2018 and 2017 items, 2018 net income was $6.2 billion, an increase of 14% (14% in constant currencies), and diluted earnings per share was $7.90, an increase of 19% (18% in constant currencies). Excluding items impacting 2017 and the 2016 strategic charges of $342 million, 2017 net income was $5.4 billion, an increase of 10% (10% in constant currencies), and diluted earnings per share was $6.66, an increase of 16% (16% in constant currencies).The Company repurchased 32.2 million shares of its stock for $5.2 billion in 2018 and 31.4 million shares of its stock for $4.6 billion in 2017, driving reductions in weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods, which positively benefited earnings per share.REVENUESThe Company’s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales, minimum rent payments and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees.The Company has continually reviewed its mix of Company-owned and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance, with a goal to be approximately 95% franchised over the long term. Franchised restaurants represent approximately 93% of McDonald's restaurants worldwide at December 31, 2018. Although refranchising allows the Company to generate more stable and predictable revenue and cash flow streams while operating with a less resource-intensive structure, the shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants negatively impacts consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales are replaced by franchised revenues, where the Company receives rent and/or royalty revenue based on a percentage of sales.Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the guidance issued in Accounting Standards Codification 606, ""Revenue Recognition - Revenue from Contracts with Customers."" This standard changed the way initial fees from franchisees for new restaurant openings and new franchise terms are recognized. Under the new guidance, initial franchise fees are being recognized evenly over the franchise term rather than immediately upon receipt. Revenues for 2018 reflected a negative impact of approximately $42 million as a result of this new guidance.In 2018, revenues decreased 8% (8% in constant currencies) and in 2017, revenues decreased 7% (8% in constant currencies). For both periods, the decreases in revenues were due to the Company's strategic refranchising initiatives, partly offset by positive comparable sales.

Franchised margin dollars represented about 85% of the combined restaurant margins in 2018, about 80% in 2017, and about 75% in 2016.In 2018, franchised margin dollars increased $727 million or 9% (8% in constant currencies). In 2017, franchised margin dollars increased $703 million or 9% (9% in constant currencies). For both 2018 and 2017, the constant currency increases were due to positive comparable sales performance across all segments, refranchising and expansion.Franchised margins Amount% of Revenue Amount% of Revenue Amount% of Revenue Increase/(decrease) Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation Dollars in millions2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2018 2017U.S.$4,07081.4% $3,91382.4% $3,72682.6% 4% 5% 4% 5%International Lead Markets2,95281.1 2,63480.8 2,36380.2 12 11 10 10High Growth Markets86776.0 69373.6 55070.2 25 26 22 24Foundational Markets & Corporate1,15093.3 1,07292.9 97089.1 7 10 9 12Total$9,03982.1% $8,31282.3% $7,60981.6% 9% 9% 8% 9%•U.S.: In 2018 and 2017, the decreases in the franchised margin percents were primarily due to higher depreciation costs related to investments in EOTF, partly offset by positive comparable sales.•International Lead Markets: In 2018 and 2017, the increases in the franchised margin percent primarily reflected the benefit from positive comparable sales performance, partly offset by the impact of refranchising and higher occupancy costs.•High Growth Markets: In 2018 and 2017, the increases in the franchised margin percents were primarily due to the impact of refranchising, mainly related to the sale of the Company's businesses in China and Hong Kong in 2017, as well as strong comparable sales performance.The franchised margin percent in Foundational Markets & Corporate is higher relative to the other segments due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed and affiliated restaurants where the Company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXESIn 2018, 2017 and 2016, the reported effective income tax rates were 24.2%, 39.4% and 31.7%, respectively.The effective income tax rate for 2018 reflected approximately $75 million of net tax cost associated with the 2018 adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded in the prior year under the Tax Act. Excluding the impact of the Tax Act and the current year impairment charges, the effective income tax rate was 22.9% for 2018. Excluding the prior year provisional net tax cost of approximately $700 million under the Tax Act, the effective income tax rate was 31.6% for 2017.Excluding the impact of the Tax Act and the current year impairment charges, the lower effective income tax rate for 2018 reflected the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% in 2018. In addition, both 2018 and 2017 reflected a benefit from a change in tax reserves as a result of global audit progression.Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $2.0 billion in 2018 and $1.5 billion in 2017. Substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the U.S. and other profitable markets.RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDSRecently issued accounting standards are included in Part II, Item 8, page 37 of this Form 10-K.Cash Flows The Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases.

In 2018, cash provided by operations increased by $1.4 billion or 25% compared with 2017, primarily due to lower tax payments. In 2017, cash provided by operations decreased by $508 million or 8% compared with 2016, as improved operating results were more than offset by higher income tax payments in the U.S. and other working capital changes.Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.5 billion in 2018, an increase of $3 billion compared with 2017. The increase was primarily due to lower proceeds from the sale of restaurant businesses in 2018, as well as higher capital expenditures. Cash provided by investing activities totaled $562 million in 2017, an increase of $1.5 billion compared with 2016. The increase was primarily due to proceeds associated with the sale of the Company's businesses in China and Hong Kong.Cash used for financing activities totaled $5.9 billion in 2018, an increase of $639 million compared with 2017, primarily due to higher treasury stock purchases. Cash used for financing activities totaled $5.3 billion in 2017, a decrease of $6 billion compared with 2016, primarily due to lower treasury stock purchases, partly offset by a decrease in net borrowings.The Company’s cash and equivalents balance was $866 million and $2.5 billion at year end 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements.RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURESIn 2018, the Company opened 1,081 restaurants and closed 467 restaurants. In 2017, the Company opened 929 restaurants and closed 587 restaurants. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure.Systemwide restaurants at year end 2018 2017 2016U.S.13,914 14,036 14,155International Lead Markets6,987 6,921 6,851High Growth Markets6,305 5,884 5,552Foundational Markets & Corporate10,649 10,400 10,341Total37,855 37,241 36,899 McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 26Approximately 93% of the restaurants at year-end 2018 were franchised, including 95% in the U.S., 88% in International Lead Markets, 83% in High Growth Markets and 98% in Foundational Markets.Capital expenditures increased $888 million or 48% in 2018, primarily due to reinvestment in existing restaurants (including investment in EOTF). Capital expenditures were relatively flat in 2017 as higher expenditures on restaurant reinvestment were offset by fewer restaurant openings that required the Company's capital. Under McDonald's developmental licensee and affiliate arrangements, licensees provide capital for the entire business and the Company generally has no capital invested.Capital expenditures invested in the U.S., International Lead Markets and High Growth Markets represented over 90% of the total in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Capital expenditures In millions2018 2017 2016New restaurants$488 $537 $674Existing restaurants2,111 1,236 1,108Other(1)143 81 39Total capital expenditures$2,742 $1,854 $1,821Total assets$32,811 $33,804 $31,024(1)Primarily corporate equipment and other office-related expendituresNew restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with strong returns and/or opportunities for long-term growth. Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, as well as leveraging the Company's global sourcing network and best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs for new traditional McDonald’s restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $3.8 million in 2018.The Company owned approximately 50% of the land and approximately 80% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2018 and 2017.SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDSIn 2018, the Company returned approximately $8.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid. This brings the cumulative two-year return to shareholders to $16.2 billion toward our targeted return of about $25 billion for the three-year period ending 2019.Shares repurchased and dividends In millions, except per share data2018 2017 2016Number of shares repurchased32.2 31.4 92.3Shares outstanding at year end767 794 819Dividends declared per share$4.19 $3.83 $3.61Treasury stock purchases (in Shareholders' equity)$5,247 $4,651 $11,142Dividends paid3,256 3,089 3,058Total returned to shareholders$8,503 $7,740 $14,200In July 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $15 billion of the Company's outstanding stock, with no specified expiration date. In 2018, approximately 32.2 million shares were repurchased for $5.2 billion, bringing total purchases under the program to approximately 49.5 million shares or $7.9 billion.The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 43 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2018 full year dividend of $4.19 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $1.01 per share, with an increase to $1.16 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 15% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $4.64 per share annual dividend and reflects the Company’s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors.Financial Position and Capital Resources TOTAL ASSETSTotal assets decreased $1.0 billion or 3% in 2018 primarily due to a decrease in cash and equivalents and the impact of foreign exchange rates, partly offset by an increase in accounts and notes receivable due to the significant number of EOTF projects and corresponding billings to franchisees for their portion of the reinvestment. Net property and equipment increased $394.4 million in 2018, primarily due to capital expenditures, partly offset by depreciation and the impact of foreign exchange rates. Net property and equipment represented about 70% of total assets at year-end. Approximately 96% of total assets were in the U.S., International Lead Markets, and High Growth Markets at year-end 2018. McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 27FINANCING AND MARKET RISKThe Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2018 totaled $31.1 billion, compared with $29.5 billion at December 31, 2017. The net increase in 2018 was primarily due to net long-term issuances of $2.0 billion.Debt highlights(1) 2018 2017 2016Fixed-rate debt as a percent of total debt(2,3)91% 89% 82%Weighted-average annual interest rate of total debt(3)3.2 3.3 3.5Foreign currency-denominated debt as a percent of total debt(2)38 42 34Total debt as a percent of total capitalization (total debt and total Shareholders' equity)(2)125 112 109Cash provided by operations as a percent of total debt(2)22 19 23(1)All percentages are as of December 31, except for the weighted-average annual interest rate, which is for the year.(2)Based on debt obligations before the effects of fair value hedging adjustments and deferred debt costs. These effects are excluded as they have no impact on the obligation at maturity. See Debt Financing note to the consolidated financial statements.(3)Includes the effect of interest rate swaps used to hedge debt.Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s currently rate, with a stable outlook, the Company’s commercial paper A-2 and P-2, respectively; and its long-term debt BBB+ and Baa1, respectively. To access the debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit-rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings. Certain of the Company’s debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company’s business. Under existing authorization from the Company’s Board of Directors, the Company has $15.0 billion of authority to borrow funds, of which $6.5 billion remains outstanding as of December 31, 2018. These borrowings may include (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the SEC and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $3.5 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and global markets (see Debt Financing note to the consolidated financial statements). In 2019, the Company plans to issue long-term debt to refinance $2.1 billion of maturing corporate debt. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's subsidiaries also had $254 million of borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements.The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments.In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $11.8 billion and $12.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See the Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives.The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2018, the Company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to negative fair value of certain derivative positions. The Company's counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Company’s supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions.The Company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Company’s largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows:Foreign currency net asset exposuresIn millions of U.S. Dollars2018 2017British Pounds Sterling$1,840 $1,877Australian Dollars1,499 1,519Canadian Dollars684 733Russian Ruble631 563Japanese Yen407 589The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 28each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. Based on the results of these analyses of the Company’s financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2018 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2018 levels would materially affect the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments.LIQUIDITYThe Company has significant operations outside the U.S. where we earn about 65% of our operating income. A significant portion of these historical earnings have been reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the Company has made, and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations.The Company's cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $708 million as of December 31, 2018. Consistent with prior years, we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, repatriation of a portion of foreign earnings, and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating, investing, and financing activities. We also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating, investing and financing activities. In the future, should we require more capital to fund activities in the U.S. than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTSThe Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2018. See discussions of cash flows, financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

In addition, future minimum payments exclude option periods that have not yet been exercised.(2)The maturities include reclassifications of short-term obligations to long-term obligations of $2.4 billion, as they are supported by a long-term line of credit agreement expiring in December 2023. Debt obligations do not include the impact of non-cash fair value hedging adjustments, deferred debt costs and accrued interest.In the U.S., the Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") limitations. At December 31, 2018, total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $437 million. At December 31, 2018, total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $1.3 billion. In addition, a liability of approximately $757 million remains resulting from the Tax Act, which imposed a deemed repatriation tax on the Company’s undistributed foreign earnings. This additional tax liability will be paid over the next eight years. Refer to the Income Taxes footnote on page 45 for additional information.There are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business. Such commitments are generally shorter term in nature, will be funded from operating cash flows, and are not significant to the Company’s overall financial position.Other Matters CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 29The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to confirm that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity:•Property and equipmentProperty and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.•Share-based compensationThe Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (""RSUs"") to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. The Company estimates forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to be recognized in each period.The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Company’s stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at date of grant, and prior to 2018 included a reduction for the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. For performance-based RSUs granted beginning in 2016, the Company includes a relative Total Shareholder Return (""TSR"") modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. The fair value of performance-based RSUs that include the TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model.•Long-lived assets impairment reviewLong-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Company’s long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Company’s experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, the Company does not have any reporting units (defined as each individual market) with risk of material goodwill impairment.•Litigation accrualsIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.•Income taxesThe Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made.The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. The most significant new developments in 2018 and 2017 are described below.In 2018 and 2017, the Company increased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits by $162 million and $256 million, respectively. In both 2018 and 2017, there was audit progression in the U.S. federal and state audits as well as multiple foreign tax jurisdictions. The Company has considered this new information in evaluating the unrecognized tax benefits and in certain situations, the Company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits. These changes have been reflected in the Unrecognized Tax Benefits table that is included in the Income Taxes footnote in the Consolidated Financial Statements.In 2015, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) issued a Revenue Agent Report (“RAR”) that included certain disagreed transfer pricing adjustments related to the Company’s U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. Also in 2015, the Company filed a protest with the IRS related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters. During 2017, the Company received a response to its protest. In December 2018, the Company met with the IRS Appeals team and additional meetings are anticipated in 2019. The Company expects resolution on these issues in 2019 or 2020.In 2017, the IRS completed its examination of the Company’s U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. In 2018, the IRS issued a RAR for these years. As expected, the RAR included the same disagreed transfer pricing matters as the 2009 and 2010 RAR. Also in 2018, the Company filed a protest with the IRS related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters. The transfer pricing matters for 2011 McDonald's Corporation 2018 Annual Report 30and 2012 are being addressed along with the 2009 and 2010 transfer pricing matters as part of the 2009-2010 appeals process, such that resolution is expected in either 2019 or 2020. While the Company cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the aforementioned tax matters, we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined in accordance with Topic 740 - Income Taxes of the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”).In December 2015, the European Commission opened a formal investigation against the Luxembourg government to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries complied with European Union rules on state aid. In September 2018, the European Commission concluded that Luxembourg’s tax treatment of these McDonald’s subsidiaries did not constitute state aid under the European Union rules. This decision resulted in no impact to the Company’s financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.The Tax Act was enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35% and required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred. In 2017, the Company recorded provisional amounts for certain enactment-date effects of the Tax Act by applying the guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin (""SAB"") 118 because the Company had not yet completed its enactment-date accounting for these effects. In 2018, the Company recorded adjustments to the provisional amounts and completed its accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 measurement period At December 31, 2017, the Company had not completed its accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Act under ASC 740, Income Taxes, primarily for the following aspects: remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, one-time transition tax, and its accounting position related to indefinite reinvestment of unremitted foreign earnings. As further discussed below, during 2018, the Company recognized adjustments of approximately $75 million to the provisional amounts recorded at December 31, 2017, primarily related to the transition tax. These adjustments are included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. One-time transition tax: The one-time transition tax is based on the Company's total post-1986 earnings and profits (""E&P""), the tax on which it previously deferred from U.S. income taxes under U.S. law. The Company recorded a provisional amount for its one-time transition tax liability for each of its foreign subsidiaries, resulting in a transition tax liability of approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017. Upon further analyses of the Tax Act and notices and regulations issued and proposed by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Company finalized its calculations of the transition tax liability during 2018 and increased its December 31, 2017 provisional amount by approximately $75 million. The Company has elected to pay its transition tax over the eight-year period provided in the Tax Act. Deferred tax assets and liabilities: As of December 31, 2017, the Company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they were expected to reverse in the future (generally 21%), by recording a provisional amount of approximately $500 million. No adjustment to the provisional amount was made in 2018. EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES—INFLATIONThe Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation.RISK FACTORS AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATIONThis report includes forward-looking statements about our plans and future performance, including those under Outlook for 2019.

63908,MCD,MCDONALDS CORP,2004,"Item 7. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations OVERVIEW DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS The Company primarily operates and franchises McDonald’s restaurants. In addition, the Company operates certain non-McDonald’s brands that are not material to the Company’s overall results. Of the more than 30,000 McDonald’s restaurants in over 100 countries, more than 8,000 are operated by the Company, approximately 18,000 are operated by franchisees and about 4,000 are operated by affiliates under license agreements. Regardless of who operates the restaurant, the Company generally owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for restaurant sites. This ensures long-term occupancy rights and helps control related costs. Revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates. These fees primarily include rent, service fees and/or royalties that are based on a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments. Fees vary by type of site, investment by the Company and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise agreements that generally have 20-year terms. We manage the business based on geographic segments: United States; Europe; Asia/Pacific, the Middle East and Africa (APMEA); Latin America and Canada. In addition, throughout this report we present a segment entitled “Other” that includes non-McDonald’s brands. The U.S. and Europe segments account for approximately 70% of total revenues. France, Germany and the United Kingdom account for about 65% of Europe’s revenues; Australia, China and Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method) account for about 45% of APMEA’s revenues; and Brazil accounts for about 40% of Latin America’s revenues. These seven markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as “major markets” throughout this report and comprise approximately 70% of total revenues. In analyzing business trends, management considers a variety of performance and financial measures including Systemwide sales growth, comparable sales growth and Company-operated margins. Systemwide sales include sales by all restaurants, whether operated by the Company, by franchisees or by affiliates. While sales by franchisees and affiliates are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company’s financial performance because they are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised and affiliated revenues and are indicative of the financial health of our franchisee base. Comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the Company’s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for all Systemwide restaurants in operation at least thirteen months. Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain compensation plans on these results because the Company believes they better represent the underlying business trends. STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND 2003 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE In 2001 and 2002, the Company’s results reflected a focus on growth through adding new restaurants, with associated high levels of capital expenditures and increasing levels of debt financing. This strategy, combined with challenging economic conditions and increased competition in certain key markets, adversely affected results and returns on investment. In 2003, the Company introduced a comprehensive revitalization plan to increase McDonald’s relevance to today’s consumers as well as improve our financial discipline. We redefined our strategy to emphasize growth through adding more customers to existing restaurants. In line with this, we took a more disciplined approach to capital allocation and put a greater emphasis on controlling expenses. We aligned the System around our customer-focused Plan to Win, designed to deliver operational excellence and leadership marketing. This Plan contains aggressive goals and measures for success based on the five drivers of exceptional customer experiences—people, products, place, price and promotion. Our near-term goal was to fortify the foundation of our business. Our long-term goal is to create a differentiated customer experience—one that builds brand loyalty—and enables us to deliver attractive top- and bottom-line growth and returns on a sustained basis. For 2005 and beyond, McDonald’s is targeting annual Systemwide sales and revenue growth of 3 percent to 5 percent, annual operating income growth of 6 percent to 7 percent and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens. (Return on incremental invested capital is the change in operating income plus depreciation divided by the change in gross assets.) These targets exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. We made significant progress in 2003 in operational excellence and leadership marketing. We improved our core menu and added several successful new products. We used more consistent, rigorous measurements such as evaluations by Company personnel, independent mystery shoppers and customer research to evaluate restaurant performance. Using this information, along with enhanced training and other processes, we have strengthened our operations. We have expanded our everyday value offerings, attracting more customer visits. We began to create more relevant McDonald’s Corporation 9 restaurant environments by updating, rebuilding and relocating some of our restaurants. We also introduced our first global marketing strategy, embodied by the “i’m lovin’ it” theme, which emphasizes more contemporary music and images and is connecting with both our customers and our employees. From a financial perspective, our results also improved in 2003. In concert with the Company’s strategic shift to emphasize growth from existing restaurants, management is focusing in particular on comparable sales and Company-operated margin trends, both of which gained momentum during the year. Performance in the U.S. was impressive, with robust annual comparable sales and margin increases. In Europe, while comparable sales were slightly negative for the year, they improved sequentially each quarter, as did Company-operated margins, compared with the prior year. APMEA’s comparable sales and Company-operated margins declined for the year, but both showed significant improvement in the second half. As part of the Company’s revitalization plan, we eliminated projects not directly affecting our customers’ experience and narrowed non-McDonald’s brand activities. These actions along with the write down of a portion of our goodwill and restaurant assets resulted in the Company recording $408 million of pretax charges (primarily noncash) in 2003. Highlights from the year included: • Comparable sales increased 2.4%, a significant improvement over the 2.1% decline in 2002. • Consolidated revenues increased 11% to a new record high of $17 billion. Excluding the positive impact of currency translation, revenues increased 6%. • Systemwide sales increased 11%. Excluding the positive impact of currency translation, Systemwide sales increased 5%. • Net income per common share totaled $1.15, compared with $0.70 in 2002. • Company-operated margins as a percent of sales improved 10 basis points, progressing toward our goal of increasing margins by 35 basis points per year beginning in 2005. • Cash from operations increased $400 million to $3.3 billion, primarily driven by higher sales at existing restaurants and stronger foreign currencies. • Capital expenditures were reduced by $700 million to $1.3 billion. • Debt pay-down totaled approximately $900 million. • The annual dividend increased 70% to more than $500 million. • Share repurchases totaled about $440 million. OUTLOOK FOR 2004 We expect 2004 to be a year of ongoing progress in operational excellence, leadership marketing and key financial metrics. We will continue to focus our revitalization efforts on improving our customers’ experiences by providing better service, enhancing food taste, menu variety and value offerings, and creating more relevant marketing. While we are confident in our plans for 2004, we also are conscious of the challenges we face. For example, we must continue to deliver solid results in the U.S., a very competitive marketplace, despite sequentially more difficult sales comparisons. We believe that the combination of initiatives that benefited our U.S. business in 2003 will continue to create positive momentum in 2004. Outside the U.S., some key markets must increase customer relevance, while others have economic challenges. We believe that we are in a better position to overcome these issues today than we have been for some time. Our plan is to leverage successes in the U.S. and other markets like Australia—such as more relevant menus, strong value platforms, creative marketing and better restaurant-level execution—to improve results in additional markets around the world. While the Company does not provide specific guidance on earnings per share, the following information is provided to assist in analyzing the Company’s results. • Changes in constant currency Systemwide sales are driven by restaurant unit expansion and changes in comparable sales. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately one percentage point to sales and operating income growth in 2004 (in constant currencies). Most of this anticipated growth will result from restaurants opened in 2003. The Company does not provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure a one percentage point increase in U.S. comparable sales would impact annual earnings per share by about 2 cents. Similarly, an increase of one percentage point in Europe’s comparable sales would impact annual earnings per share by about 1.5 cents. • The Company expects full year 2004 selling, general & administrative expenses to be relatively flat to up slightly in constant currencies and to decline as a percent of revenues and Systemwide sales, compared with 2003. However, due to the timing of certain expenses, the Company expects selling, general & administrative expenses to increase in the first half of 2004 and to decline in the second half, compared with 2003. • A significant part of the Company’s operating income is from outside the U.S., and more than 70% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro and the British Pound. If the Euro and the British Pound both move 10% in the same direction (compared with 2003 average rates), 10 McDonald’s Corporation the Company’s annual earnings per share would change by about 5 cents to 6 cents. In 2003, foreign currency translation benefited earnings per share by 7 cents. • For 2004, the Company expects its net debt principal repayments to be approximately $400 million to $700 million. However, despite lower average debt balances, the Company expects interest expense to be relatively flat compared with 2003 due to stronger foreign currencies. • The Company expects the effective income tax rate for 2004 to be between 32.5% and 33.5%. • The Company expects capital expenditures for 2004 to be approximately $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. • The Company expects to return about $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2004. A number of factors can affect our business, including effectiveness of operating initiatives and changes in global and local business and economic conditions. These and other risks are noted in the Forward-looking statements at the end of Management’s discussion and analysis.

STRATEGIC ACTIONS In 2003, the Company eliminated projects not directly impacting its customers’ experience, narrowed its non-McDonald’s brand activities, aligned its System around a single action plan (Plan to Win), and re-established McDonald’s marketing leadership through the introduction of its first ever global brand strategy embodied by the “i’m lovin’ it” theme. These actions were consistent with management’s strategy of concentrating the Company’s capital and resources on the best near-term opportunities and avoiding those that distract from restaurant-level execution. In 2002, the Company initiated actions designed to optimize restaurant operations and improve the business. They included the restructuring of certain international markets, the closing of a significant number of underperforming restaurants, the decision to terminate a long-term technology project, and the consolidation of certain home office facilities and elimination of positions to control costs, streamline operations and reallocate resources. McDonald’s Corporation 11 In 2001, the Company also implemented structural changes and restaurant initiatives, primarily in the U.S. The changes included streamlining operations by reducing the number of U.S. regions and divisions, enabling the Company to combine staff functions and improve efficiency. The Company recorded charges associated with certain of the above actions as “special items.” Special items generally represent actions or transactions related to the implementation of strategic initiatives of the Company, items that are unusual or infrequent in nature (such as the dispositions of certain non-McDonald’s brands in 2003 and the Japan IPO gain in 2001), and charges resulting from annual goodwill and asset impairment testing. McDonald’s management does not include these items when reviewing business performance trends because they do not believe these items are indicative of expected ongoing results. On a pretax basis, the Company recorded $408 million of special charges in 2003, $853 million of special charges in 2002 and $253 million of special items in 2001. All special items were recorded in other operating expense, except as noted in the discussion that follows.

The Company expects to use cash provided by operations to fund the remaining employee severance and lease obligations associated with the special charges. (2) Certain special items were not tax-effected. Restructuring In 2003, the Company recorded $272 million of pretax charges consisting of: $237 million related to the loss on the sale of Donatos Pizzeria, the closing of all Donatos and Boston Market restaurants outside the U.S. and the exit of a domestic joint venture with Fazoli’s; and $35 million related to revitalization plan actions of McDonald’s Japan, including headcount reductions, the closing of Pret A Manger stores in Japan, and the early termination of a long-term management services agreement. In 2002, the Company recorded $267 million of net pretax charges consisting of: $201 million related to the anticipated transfer of ownership in five countries in the Middle East and Latin America to developmental licensees and ceasing operations in two countries in Latin America; $81 million primarily related to eliminating approximately 600 positions (about half of which were in the U.S. and half of which were in international markets), reallocating resources and consolidating certain home office facilities to control costs; and a $15 million favorable adjustment to the 2001 restructuring charge due to lower employee-related costs than originally anticipated. Under the developmental license business structure, which the Company successfully employs in about 30 markets outside the U.S. (approximately 400 restaurants), the licensee owns the business, including the real estate interest. While the Company generally does not have any capital invested in these markets, it receives a royalty based on a percent of sales. In 2001, the Company recorded $200 million of pretax restructuring charges related to initiatives designed to improve the restaurant experience, primarily in the U.S. These initiatives included streamlining operations by reducing the number of regions and divisions, enabling the Company to combine staff functions and improve efficiency. In connection with these initiatives, the Company eliminated approximately 850 positions (700 in the U.S., primarily in the divisions and regions, and 150 in international markets). Restaurant closings/asset impairment In 2003, the Company recorded $136 million of net pretax charges consisting of: $148 million primarily related to asset/goodwill impairment, mainly in Latin America; $30 million for about 50 restaurant closings associated with strategic actions in Latin America; and a $42 million favorable adjustment to the 2002 charge for restaurant closings, primarily due to about 85 fewer closings than originally anticipated. The lower closings were primarily due to management’s reassessment of the plans as a result of the new strategic direction of the Company. In 2002, the Company recorded $402 million of pretax charges consisting of: $302 million related to management’s decision to close 751 underperforming restaurants primarily in the U.S. and Japan; and $100 million primarily related to the impairment of assets for certain existing restaurants in Europe and Latin America. Most of the restaurants identified for closing had negative cash flows and/or very low annual sales volumes. Also, in many cases they would have required significant capital investment to remain financially viable. 12 McDonald’s Corporation In 2001, the Company recorded $135 million of pretax charges consisting of: $91 million related to the closing of 163 underperforming restaurants in international markets; a $24 million asset impairment charge in Turkey; and $20 million related to the disposition of Aroma Café in the U.K. Although restaurant closings occur each year, these restaurant closing charges in each year were identified as “special charges” because they were the result of separate intensive reviews by management in conjunction with other strategic actions. Other In 2002, the Company recorded $184 million of pretax charges consisting of: $170 million primarily related to the write-off of software development costs as a result of management’s decision to terminate a long-term technology project; and $14 million primarily related to the write-off of receivables and inventory in Venezuela as a result of the temporary closure of all McDonald’s restaurants due to a national strike. Although the terminated technology project was expected to deliver long-term benefits, it was no longer viewed as the best use of capital, as the anticipated Systemwide cost over several years was expected to be more than $1 billion. In 2001, the Company recorded $55 million of pretax charges consisting of: $18 million primarily related to the write-off of certain technology costs; $12 million (recorded in nonoperating expense) primarily related to the write-off of a corporate investment; and $25 million primarily related to the unrecoverable costs incurred in connection with the theft of winning game pieces from the Company’s Monopoly and certain other promotional games over an extended period of time, and the related termination of the supplier of the game pieces. Fifty individuals (none of whom were Company employees) were convicted of conspiracy and/or mail fraud charges. McDonald’s Japan IPO gain In 2001, McDonald’s Japan, the Company’s 50%-owned affiliate, completed an IPO of 12 million shares. The Company recorded a $137 million gain (pre and after tax) in nonoperating income to reflect an increase in the carrying value of its investment as a result of the cash proceeds from the IPO received by McDonald’s Japan. IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES ON REPORTED RESULTS While changing foreign currencies affect reported results, McDonald’s lessens exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows, and by purchasing goods and services in local currencies. In 2003, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated revenues, operating income and earnings per share due to the strengthening of several major currencies, primarily the Euro. In 2002, foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on revenues as the stronger Euro and British Pound were offset by weaker Latin American currencies (primarily the Argentine Peso, Brazilian Real and Venezuelan Bolivar). Operating income in 2002 was positively impacted by foreign currency translation primarily due to the stronger Euro and British Pound.

These initiatives included the introduction of Premium Salads and McGriddles breakfast sandwiches, the Dollar Menu, extended hours, a heightened focus on operations, more disciplined measurements and a new marketing direction. Results also reflected improvement in the U.S. economy in 2003. In 2002, revenues increased slightly due to restaurant expansion. Results in 2002, in part, reflected the overall slowdown in the restaurant industry and increased competition. In 2003 and 2002, Europe’s revenues reflected strong performance in Russia driven by expansion and positive comparable sales, along with expansion in France. These results were partly offset by weak results in the U.K. and Germany, although Germany’s performance improved in the second half of 2003. In 2003 and 2002, APMEA’s revenues benefited from positive comparable sales in Australia and expansion in China. Revenues were negatively affected in 2003 by weak results in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan, compounded by consumer concerns about Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in several markets in the first half of the year. In addition, Japan had negative comparable sales for 2003 and 2002, although the market’s performance improved in the fourth quarter of 2003. In 2002, revenues reflected a benefit from the restructuring of our ownership in the Philippines, effective July 2001, that resulted in the reclassification of franchised restaurants to Company-operated. In Latin America, revenues in 2003 increased in constant currencies primarily due to a higher percentage of Company-operated restaurants. The increase in revenues in 2002 was primarily due to positive comparable sales in Brazil and expansion in Mexico. 14 McDonald’s Corporation The following tables present Systemwide sales growth rates and the increase or decrease in comparable sales.

In 2003, U.S. operating income included higher combined operating margin dollars, higher selling, general & administrative expenses and higher other operating expenses (excluding special charges). U.S. operating income in 2002 included lower combined operating margin dollars, lower selling, general & administrative expenses and lower other operating income (excluding special charges). Europe’s constant currency results in 2003 and 2002 benefited from strong performances in France and Russia. However, difficult economic conditions in Germany and weak results in the U.K. negatively impacted results in both years. Despite the difficult economic conditions, Germany’s performance improved in the second half of 2003. APMEA’s constant currency results in 2003 reflected strong results in Australia. However, weak results in most other markets, compounded by concerns about SARS in certain markets, negatively impacted the segment. In 2002, strong results in Australia were more than offset by weak results in Japan and Hong Kong. Latin America’s operating income in constant currencies significantly declined in both 2003 and 2002 due to the continuing difficult economic conditions experienced by several key markets in the segment. In addition, Latin America’s results for both years were negatively impacted by higher provisions for uncollectible receivables. The Company is currently in litigation with about one-third of the franchisees in Brazil, which is negatively impacting the Company’s results in Latin America. We expect this to continue in the near term. 16 McDonald’s Corporation OPERATING MARGINS Operating margin information and discussions relate to McDonald’s restaurants only and exclude non-McDonald’s brands. Company-operated margins Company-operated margin dollars represent sales by Company-operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. Company-operated margin dollars increased $182 million or 12% (5% in constant currencies) in 2003 and declined $12 million or 1% (3% in constant currencies) in 2002. The constant currency increase in 2003 was primarily due to strong comparable sales in the U.S. The constant currency decrease in 2002 was primarily due to negative comparable sales and higher labor rates, partly offset by restaurant expansion.

The U.S. Company-operated margin percent increased in 2003 primarily due to positive comparable sales and lower payroll as a percent of sales due to improved productivity and lower wage inflation. Higher commodity costs partly offset these trends. In 2002, the U.S. Company-operated margin percent benefited from the elimination of goodwill amortization and a lower advertising contribution rate, while weak comparable sales and higher labor costs negatively impacted the margin. In 2003, Europe’s Company-operated margin percent reflected weak performance in the U.K. (which has the largest number of Company-operated restaurants in Europe), partly offset by improved margin performance in Germany and France. In 2002, Europe’s Company-operated margin percent reflected higher labor costs and an increase in occupancy & other operating expenses. Franchised margins Franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants less the Company’s occupancy costs (rent and depreciation) associated with those sites. Franchised margin dollars represented more than 65% of the combined operating margins in 2003, 2002 and 2001. Franchised margin dollars increased $341 million or 11% (5% in constant currencies) in 2003 and $36 million or 1% (flat in constant currencies) in 2002.

The decline in the consolidated franchised margin percent in 2002 reflected negative comparable sales, higher rent assistance to franchisees primarily in the U.S. and Europe, and higher occupancy costs, due in part to an increased proportion of leased sites. SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Consolidated selling, general & administrative expenses increased 7% in 2003 and 3% in 2002 (3% and 4% in constant currencies). The constant currency increase in 2003 was primarily due to higher performance-based incentive compensation, as well as severance and other costs associated with the strategic decision to reduce restaurant openings. The constant currency increase in 2002 was primarily due to higher spending on technology in the Corporate segment, higher advertising expenses in the U.S. primarily related to the introduction of the Dollar Menu, and higher expenses for non-McDonald’s brands. McDonald’s Corporation 17 Selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of revenues declined to 10.7% in 2003 compared with 11.1% in 2002 and 11.2% in 2001, and selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales declined to 4.0% in 2003 compared with 4.1% in 2002 and 2001. Management believes that analyzing selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales as well as revenues is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support Systemwide restaurants.

Gains on sales of restaurant businesses Gains on sales of restaurant businesses include gains from sales of Company-operated restaurants as well as gains from exercises of purchase options by franchisees with business facilities lease arrangements (arrangements where the Company leases the businesses, including equipment, to franchisees who have options to purchase the businesses). The Company’s purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees and affiliates are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business. The Company expects lower gains on sales of restaurant businesses in 2004 compared with 2003. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates—businesses in which the Company actively participates but does not control—is reported after interest expense and income taxes, except for U.S. restaurant partnerships, which are reported before income taxes. The increase in 2003 was primarily due to strong results in the U.S. The decrease in 2002 was due to a net loss from our Japanese affiliate compared with earnings in 2001. Other expense Other expense in 2003 reflected higher losses on asset dispositions, higher provisions for uncollectible receivables (primarily in Latin America), and costs in the U.S. related to sites that will no longer be developed as a result of management’s decision to significantly reduce capital expenditures. Other expense in 2002 reflected payments to U.S. owner/operators to facilitate the introduction of a new front counter service system and higher provisions for uncollectible receivables (primarily in Europe and Latin America), partly offset by a benefit from the elimination of goodwill amortization. The Company expects lower other expense in 2004 compared with 2003. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense increased in 2003 due to stronger foreign currencies, partly offset by lower average debt levels and interest rates. Interest expense decreased in 2002 due to lower average interest rates, partly offset by higher average debt levels and stronger foreign currencies. NONOPERATING EXPENSE, NET Nonoperating expense includes miscellaneous income and expense items such as interest income, minority interests, and gains and losses related to other investments, financings and foreign currency translation. Nonoperating expense in 2003 reflected an $11 million loss on the early extinguishment of $200 million of debt as well as higher foreign currency translation losses compared with 2002. Nonoperating expense in 2002 reflected higher minority interest expense and foreign currency translation losses in 2002 compared with foreign currency translation gains 18 McDonald’s Corporation in 2001. In addition, nonoperating expense in 2001 included $12 million primarily related to the write-off of a corporate investment as well as minority interest expense related to the sale of real estate in Singapore. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES The following table presents the reported effective income tax rates as well as the effective income tax rates before special items. 2003 2002 2001 Reported effective income tax rates 35.7 % 40.3 % 29.8 % Impact of special items(1) (2.2 ) (7.6 ) 1.3 Effective income tax rates before special items 33.5 % 32.7 % 31.1 % (1) Certain special items were not tax-effected. The 2001 effective income tax rate reflected a benefit from the impact of tax law changes in certain international markets. Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1,032 million in 2003 and $867 million in 2002. Substantially all of the net tax assets arose in the U.S. and other profitable markets. CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and instead subjects it to annual impairment tests. See summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. CASH FLOWS The Company generates significant cash from operations and has substantial credit capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending. Cash from operations totaled $3.3 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $2.0 billion in 2003, while cash from operations totaled $2.9 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $0.9 billion in 2002. Cash provided by operations, along with borrowings and other sources of cash, is used for capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Cash provided by operations DOLLARS IN MILLIONS 2003 2002 2001 Cash provided by operations $ 3,269 $ 2,890 $ 2,688 Cash provided by operations as a percent of capital expenditures 250 % 144 % 141 % In addition to its cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. Accordingly, the Company purposefully maintains a relatively low current ratio, which was .76 at year-end 2003. RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES As a result of the Company strategically shifting its focus from adding new restaurants to building sales at existing restaurants, the Company significantly reduced capital expenditures and restaurant openings in 2003 compared with 2002 and 2001. In 2003, the Company opened 513 traditional McDonald’s restaurants and 319 satellite restaurants (small, limited-menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 486 traditional restaurants and 184 satellite restaurants. In 2002, the Company opened 1,247 traditional McDonald’s restaurants and 392 satellite restaurants, and closed 474 traditional restaurants and 158 satellite restaurants. About 65% of McDonald’s restaurant additions occurred in the major markets in 2003.

In 2004, the Company expects to open about 550 traditional McDonald’s restaurants and 300 satellite restaurants and close about 300 traditional restaurants and 100 satellite restaurants. Approximately 60% of Company-operated restaurants and more than 85% of franchised restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2003. Franchisees and affiliates operated 73% of McDonald’s restaurants at year-end 2003. Non-McDonald’s brand restaurants are primarily Company-operated. Capital expenditures decreased $697 million or 35% in 2003 and increased $98 million or 5% in 2002. The decrease in capital expenditures in 2003 was primarily due to lower restaurant openings, consistent with our shift in strategic focus, partly offset by stronger foreign currencies (foreign currency translation increased capital expenditures by $73 million). The increase in 2002 was primarily due to higher spending in the U.S. and Canada, partly offset by lower capital expenditures for new restaurants in Latin America. Capital expenditures for McDonald’s restaurants McDonald’s Corporation 19 in 2003, 2002 and 2001 reflected the leasing of a higher proportion of new sites and a program that gave U.S. franchisees the option to purchase new restaurant buildings. During 2003, the Company began to phase out the option for U.S. franchisees to purchase new restaurant buildings. Consequently, the Company is currently purchasing most buildings and, as a result, collects additional rent from the franchisees. Capital expenditures invested in major markets excluding Japan represented approximately 70% of the total in 2003 and 2002 and 60% in 2001. Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts. Capital expenditures IN MILLIONS 2003 2002 2001 New restaurants $ 617 $ 1,161 $ 1,198 Existing restaurants(1) 564 659 571 Other properties(2) 126 184 137 Total $ 1,307 $ 2,004 $ 1,906 Total assets $ 25,525 $ 23,971 $ 22,535 (1) Includes technology to improve service and food quality and enhancements to facilities to achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction. (2) Primarily computer equipment and furnishings for office buildings. Capital expenditures for new restaurants decreased $544 million or 47% in 2003 because the Company opened fewer restaurants and concentrated new restaurant investments in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long-term growth. While capital expenditures for existing restaurants decreased in 2003, they increased as a percentage of total capital spending. This is due to the Company’s focus on growing sales at existing restaurants including reinvestment initiatives such as restaurant reimaging in several markets around the world, including the U.S. Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment owned by the Company, are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, standardization and global sourcing. In addition, foreign currency fluctuations affect average development costs. In 2004, the Company is targeting eleven consolidated markets, including the U.S., for opening ten or more restaurants. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs on every restaurant opened, in 2003 total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonald’s restaurants averaged approximately $1.8 million in the U.S. and approximately $1.7 million in the ten markets outside the U.S. The Company and its affiliates owned about 37% of the land and 60% of the buildings for its restaurants at year-end 2003 and 2002. SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS During 2003, the Company acquired 18.9 million shares of McDonald’s stock for approximately $439 million under a $5.0 billion share repurchase program authorized in 2001. Through 2003, 39.0 million shares for $975 million have been repurchased under this program. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 28 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. In 2003, the Company declared a 70% increase in the annual dividend to $504 million, reflecting the Company’s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow, the positive results from its revitalization efforts and favorable changes in the U.S. tax law. As in the past, future dividends will be considered after reviewing returns to shareholders, profitability expectations and financing needs and will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Cash dividends are declared and paid on an annual basis. FINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES TOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNS Total assets grew by $1.6 billion or 6% in 2003 and $1.4 billion or 6% in 2002. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased total assets by approximately $1.9 billion in 2003 and $785 million in 2002. At year-end 2003 and 2002, approximately 65% of consolidated assets was located in the major markets excluding Japan. Net property and equipment rose $1.3 billion in 2003 and represented 78% of total assets at year end. Operating income is used to compute return on average assets, while income before the cumulative effect of accounting changes is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. Returns on assets and equity 2003 2002 2001 Return on average assets 11.4 % 9.2 % 12.3 % Return on average common equity 13.3 9.8 17.5 Special charges reduced return on average assets by 1.4% points in 2003, 3.6% points in 2002 and 1.8% points in 2001. In addition, these charges reduced return on average common equity by 2.8% points in 2003, 7.0% points in 2002 and 1.6% points in 2001. In 2003, return on average assets and return on average common equity both began to stabilize due to strong operating results in the U.S., partly offset by continued weak operating results in most markets in APMEA and Latin America. In 2002, return on average assets and return on average common equity both declined, primarily due to weak operating results in APMEA and Latin America. During 2004, the Company will continue to concentrate McDonald’s restaurant openings and new capital invested in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long-term growth. 20 McDonald’s Corporation FINANCINGS AND MARKET RISK The Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2003 totaled $9.7 billion compared with $10.0 billion at December 31, 2002. The net decrease in 2003 was due to net payments ($892 million) and SFAS No. 133 noncash fair value adjustments ($44 million), partly offset by the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt ($686 million). Debt highlights(1) 2003 2002 2001 Fixed-rate debt as a percent of total debt(2,3) 62 % 62 % 45 % Weighted-average annual interest rate of total debt 4.1 4.1 5.4 Foreign currency-denominated debt as a percent of total debt(2,3) 71 64 57 Total debt as a percent of total capitalization (total debt and total shareholders’ equity)(2) 44 48 48 Cash provided by operations as a percent of total debt(2) 35 30 30 (1) All percentages are as of December 31, except for the weighted-average annual interest rate, which is for the year. (2) Based on debt obligations before the effect of SFAS No. 133 fair value adjustments. (3) Includes the effect of interest rate and foreign currency exchange agreements. Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch currently rate McDonald’s commercial paper P-1, A-1 and F1; and its long-term debt A2, A and A, respectively. Historically the Company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt. The Company’s key metrics for monitoring its credit structure are shown in the preceding table. While the Company targets these metrics for ease of focus, it also looks at similar credit ratios that incorporate capitalized operating leases to estimate total adjusted debt using a multiple of eight times rent expense after considering certain adjustments to more accurately reflect its total aggregate lease commitments. These adjustments include: excluding percent rents in excess of minimum rents; excluding certain Company-operated restaurant lease agreements outside the U.S. that are cancelable with minimal penalties (representing approximately 20% of Company-operated restaurant leases outside the U.S., based on the Company’s estimate); capitalizing non-restaurant leases using a multiple of three times rent expense; and reducing total rent expense by approximately half of the annual minimum rent payments due to the Company from franchisees operating on leased sites. Certain of the Company’s debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company’s business. The Company has $1.3 billion available under committed line of credit agreements (see debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements) as well as $1.6 billion under a U.S. shelf registration and $607 million under a Euro Medium-Term Notes program for future debt issuance. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All exchange agreements are over-the-counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. All derivatives were recorded at fair value in the Company’s Consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003 and 2002 as follows: miscellaneous other assets–$102 million and $134 million; other long-term liabilities (excluding interest)–$136 million and $39 million; and accrued payroll and other liabilities–$29 million and $24 million. See summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments for additional information regarding their use and the impact of SFAS No.133 regarding derivatives. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity. Total foreign currency denominated debt, including the effects of foreign currency exchange agreements, was $6.8 billion at year-end 2003 and $6.2 billion at year-end 2002. In addition, where practical, McDonald’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2003, the Company was required to post collateral of $11.6 million, and at December 31, 2002, collateral of $2.2 million was posted by a counterparty. The Company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Company’s largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures IN MILLIONS OF U.S. DOLLARS 2003 2002 Euro $ 1,922 $ 1,536 Canadian Dollars 1,086 808 Australian Dollars 781 620 British Pounds Sterling 741 700 Brazilian Reais 365 385 McDonald’s Corporation 21 The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels or local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the U.S. Based on the results of these analyses of the Company’s financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2003 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2003 levels would materially affect the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2003. (See discussions of cash flows, financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the December 31, 2003 consolidated financial statements for further details.)

Debt obligations do not include $321 million of SFAS No.133 noncash fair value adjustments. The Company maintains a nonqualified, unfunded Supplemental Plan that allows participants to make tax-deferred contributions and receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan because of Internal Revenue Service limitations. The investment alternatives and returns in the Supplemental Plan are based on certain market-rate investment alternatives under the Profit Sharing and Savings Plan. Total liabilities under the Supplemental Plan were $329 million at December 31, 2003 and $297 million at December 31, 2002, and were included in other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet. In addition to long-term obligations, the Company had guaranteed certain affiliate and other loans totaling $89 million at December 31, 2003. OTHER MATTERS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue. The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense in future periods. 22 McDonald’s Corporation Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Company’s long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. (The biggest assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales.) Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Company’s experience and knowledge of operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. If the Company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Restructuring and Litigation Accruals The Company has recorded charges related to restructuring markets, closing restaurants, eliminating positions and other strategic changes. The accruals recorded included estimates pertaining to employee termination costs, number of restaurants to be closed and remaining lease obligations for closed facilities. Although the Company does not anticipate significant changes, the actual costs may differ from these estimates. From time to time, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to franchisees, suppliers, employees, customers, competitors and intellectual property. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Income Taxes The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for basis differences totaling $4.2 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries or affiliates. The basis differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings considered permanently invested in the businesses. If management’s intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES – INFLATION The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings—many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation.

63908,MCD,MCDONALDS CORP,2006,"Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Description of the business The Company primarily franchises and operates McDonald’s restaurants. In addition, the Company operates certain non-McDonald’s brands that are not material to the Company’s overall results. Of the more than 30,000 McDonald’s restaurants in over 100 countries, over 8,000 are operated by the Company, more than 18,000 are operated by franchisees/licensees and over 4,000 are operated by affiliates. Under our conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the required capital by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and décor of their restaurant businesses, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and franchised restaurant sites. This ensures long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and improves alignment with franchisees. Under our developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for 100% of the business, including the real estate interest, while the Company generally has no capital invested. While we view ourselves primarily as a franchisor, we continually review our restaurant ownership mix (that is our mix between Company-operated, conventional franchise, joint venture or developmental license) to deliver a great customer experience and drive profitability, with a focus on underperforming markets and markets where direct restaurant operation by us is unattractive due to market size, business conditions or legal considerations. Although direct restaurant operation is more capital-intensive relative to franchising and results in lower operating margins as a percent of revenues, Company-operated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets. In our Company-operated restaurants along with our franchisees, we can develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that we introduce Systemwide only those that we believe are most beneficial. In addition, we firmly believe that owning restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor. Our Company-operated business also helps to facilitate changes in restaurant ownership as warranted by strategic considerations, the financial health of franchisees or other factors. Revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates. These fees primarily include rent, service fees and/or royalties that are based on a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. The business is managed as distinct geographic segments: United States; Europe; Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA); Latin America; and Canada. In addition, throughout this report we present a segment entitled “Other” that includes non-McDonald’s brands (e.g., Boston Market and Chipotle Mexican Grill (Chipotle)). The U.S. and Europe segments each account for approximately 35% of total revenues. France, Germany and the United Kingdom, collectively, account for over 60% of Europe’s revenues; Australia, China and Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), collectively, account for nearly 50% of APMEA’s revenues; and Brazil accounts for over 40% of Latin America’s revenues. These seven markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as “major markets” throughout this report and comprise approximately 70% of total revenues. In analyzing business trends, management considers a variety of performance and financial measures including comparable sales growth, Systemwide sales growth, operating margins and returns. • Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain compensation plans on these results because the Company believes they better represent the underlying business trends. • Comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the Company’s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for all McDonald’s restaurants in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include road construction, reimaging or remodeling, and natural disasters. McDonald’s reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays, weekend days and timing of holidays in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales. The Company refers to this impact as the calendar shift/trading day adjustment. This impact varies geographically due to consumer spending patterns and has the greatest impact on monthly comparable sales. Typically, the annual impact is minimal, with the exception of leap years. • Systemwide sales include sales at all McDonald’s and Other restaurants, whether operated by the Company, by franchisees or by affiliates. While sales by franchisees and affiliates are not recorded as revenues by the Company, McDonald’s Corporation 13 management believes the information is important in understanding the Company’s financial performance because it is the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised and affiliated revenues and is indicative of the financial health of our franchisee base. • Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over a one-year time period as well as longer time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by taking the constant foreign exchange rate change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) and dividing this by the constant foreign exchange rate adjusted cash used for investing activities (denominator). The calculation assumes an average exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. Strategic direction and financial performance The Company’s 50 years of success has been driven by the strength of McDonald’s global brand and our unique business relationship among franchisees, suppliers and the Company (collectively referred to as the System). This business model is key to our success, fostering our ability to be locally relevant, a competitor in the marketplace and a contributor to our communities. This strategic alignment enables the System to pursue innovative ideas that satisfy our customers and profitably grow our business. In 2003, the Company initiated a comprehensive revitalization plan focused on maximizing customer satisfaction and strengthening our financial position. We redefined our strategy to emphasize growth through adding more customers to existing restaurants and aligned the System around our customer-focused Plan to Win. A combination of customer-centric initiatives designed to deliver operational excellence and leadership marketing were implemented around five drivers of exceptional customer experiences—people, products, place, price and promotion. In 2004, we substantially achieved our near-term goals by executing our strategy. We improved the taste of many of our core menu offerings and introduced a variety of menu choices that were well received by customers such as new salad lines, breakfast and chicken offerings. We offered a variety of price points to appeal to a broad spectrum of customers. We streamlined processes such as new product development and restaurant operations, improved our training programs, and implemented performance measures, including a restaurant review and measurement process, to enable and motivate franchisees and restaurant employees to serve customers better. We also launched the “i’m lovin’ it” marketing theme, which achieved high levels of customer awareness worldwide. Throughout 2005, we remained aligned and focused on executing the Plan to Win, using our customer-centric philosophy as our guide. Our 2005 performance reflected our continuously evolving customer relevance and powerful brand strength that culminated with December 2005 marking our 32nd consecutive month of positive global comparable sales. In the U.S., our strong sales momentum continued as increased customer demand for our core and premium products, breakfast menu and more convenient hours fueled growth on top of strong prior year comparisons. In Europe, we focused on gaining traction and building momentum across the entire segment. We had success in France and Russia and we gained traction in Germany where customers responded favorably to our Ein Mal Eins (“one by one”) value platform and premium products like Salads Plus. The U.K. remained a challenging marketplace and our efforts to gain traction in this market will take time. We are encouraged by our progress in Europe and confident that our focus on enhancing customers’ experience through menu, marketing and value initiatives will generate improvements over time. Over the past three years, in line with our commitment to revitalize the brand, we have exercised greater financial discipline. We delivered against the targets laid out in our revitalization plan and achieved many significant milestones. Today, our resulting financial strength and substantial cash generating ability is a testament to System alignment and focus on growing our existing restaurant business. Our progress has created the opportunity to return even greater amounts of cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases after funding investments in our business that offer solid returns. In 2005, we increased the dividend to $.67 per share, a 185% increase from the 2002 dividend and we repurchased over $2.2 billion of common stock since the beginning of 2003 to enhance shareholder value. Highlights from the year included: • Comparable sales increased 3.9% building on a 6.9% increase in 2004. • Systemwide sales increased 6%. Excluding the positive impact of currency translation, Systemwide sales increased 5%. • Consolidated revenues increased 7% to a record high of over $20 billion. Excluding the positive impact of currency translation, revenues increased 6%. • Net income per common share was $2.04 compared with $1.79 in 2004. • Cash from operations increased $433 million to $4.3 billion. • Capital expenditures were about $1.6 billion. • The annual dividend was increased 22% per share, to $0.67 or $842 million. • Share repurchases totaled about $1.2 billion. • One-year ROIIC was 46.0% and three-year ROIIC was 36.6% for 2005. The decrease in Impairment and other charges (credits) included in operating income benefited these returns 20 percentage points and 18 percentage points, respectively. (See Other matters for details of the calculation.) 14 McDonald’s Corporation On January 1, 2005, the Company early adopted the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123(R), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No.123(R)). This new accounting standard requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. The Company adopted this accounting treatment prospectively. In connection with the adoption, the Company adjusted the mix of employee long-term incentive-based compensation by reducing stock options awarded and increasing certain cash-based compensation (primarily annual incentive-based compensation) and other equity-based awards. Share-based compensation was included as a pro forma disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for years prior to the adoption. In 2005, share-based and related compensation expense was $0.10 per share. The pro forma share-based compensation for 2004 and 2003 was $0.11 per share and $0.17 per share, respectively. During 2005, the Company repatriated approximately $3 billion of foreign historical earnings under the Homeland Investment Act (HIA). A majority of the repatriation was funded through local borrowings in certain markets, which totaled $2.9 billion. This resulted in an increase in cash and debt on our consolidated balance sheet at year end, which is expected to be temporary and does not signal any change in our financial and capital discipline. The repatriated cash will primarily be used to fund capital expenditures under our remodeling initiative, new restaurant openings and salaries in the U.S. Apart from HIA-related activity, the Company paid down over $1.2 billion of debt during 2005. Outlook for 2006 The Company’s long-term goal is to create a differentiated customer experience—one that builds brand loyalty and delivers long term, profitable growth for all shareholders and the System. Our long term goals remain unchanged: average annual Systemwide sales and revenue growth of 3% to 5%, average annual operating income growth of 6% to 7%, and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens. These goals exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. Our guiding customer-centric framework, the Plan to Win, remains solidly in place. We plan to create more relevant and deeper connections with our customers by capturing significant opportunities within the five fundamental drivers of our plan—people, products, place, price and promotion. The initiatives around each “P” continuously evolve to maximize customer relevance and System profitability. We are confident that our Plan, supported by our unique system of franchisees and suppliers and our collective alignment will continue to drive long term profitable growth and enhance shareholder value. In 2006, we remain committed to offering quality products that satisfy our customers’ demands for choice and variety, promoting the importance of physical activity and providing nutritional information on our food packaging. We will continue to introduce locally relevant new products that complement our core menu and provide customers with more reasons to visit, more often. In the U.S., we will extend the variety of our salad and chicken lines with the introduction of an Asian chicken salad, and we expect to strengthen our share of the growing chicken sandwich market with our premium Spicy Chicken Sandwich. In Europe, we are continuing our focus on our everyday value menus, such as Ein Mal Eins and Pound Saver along with premium offerings including salads and sandwiches such as the Big Tasty. In Asia, where rice is a daily staple, we successfully introduced an innovative rice burger in 2005 in Taiwan—Kalubi beef or Spicy Chicken served on a lightly toasted rice patty—and have plans to extend this concept to other Asian markets in 2006. Delivering value through a variety of menu price points that appeal to our broad range of customers has long been part of our history. A strong balance of core menu favorites, premium products and everyday value ensures that we can appeal to most people. In Europe and elsewhere, we continue to combine everyday value with a strong trade-up strategy to remain relevant to today’s customer and drive profitability. We also plan to capitalize on opportunities to improve the customer experience in our restaurants through improved service and ambiance. We continue to implement people training programs to enhance the overall service experience and we will extend our Restaurant Operation Improvement Process (ROIP) measurement of restaurant execution to even more markets this year. Our remodeling efforts will continue around the globe. In 2006, 2,500 restaurants worldwide are expected to be remodeled, utilizing innovative, modern designs. We will continue to enhance customer convenience by extending operating hours, accepting debit, credit and gift cards, enabling wireless internet access and adding double drive thru lanes in select restaurants. We believe providing information on nutrition and promoting physical activity support our customers’ needs to make the best choices for their lifestyles. Starting in 2006, we will provide nutrition information on the majority of our food packaging using an easy to understand icon and bar chart format. We plan to implement the new packaging in more than 20,000 restaurants by the end of the year. We are the first quick-service restaurant to do this, guided by customer input and independent experts from around the world. In connection with executing the Plan to Win, to improve local relevance, profitability and returns, we continually evaluate ownership structures in our markets to identify potential operational and growth opportunities. The ownership mix in a given market depends on our plans for the market, local operating conditions, restaurant-level results in the market and legal and regulatory constraints. In the United States, France, Germany and Australia, for example, we believe that our current ownership mix is appropriate in light of current operating results. By contrast, we plan to re-franchise at least 50 Company-operated restaurants in the U.K. in 2006 and McDonald’s Corporation 15 we expect that the percentage of Company-operated restaurants in that market will continue to decline from its current 63%. In Canada, we plan to review our Company-operated restaurants and determine the most appropriate ownership mix and organize personnel around a revised structure for the business. In countries where franchising is not yet a well established business model, such as China or Russia, we will continue to own and operate our restaurants. We have also recently identified between 15 and 20 markets where we will pursue converting our existing ownership to a developmental licensee structure over the next three years. Under this structure, which the Company successfully employs in 32 countries outside the U.S. (approximately 800 restaurants), the licensees own the business, including the real estate interest, and use their local knowledge and their capital to build the brand and optimize sales and profitability over the long-term. Included in these 32 countries were two additional markets (325 restaurants) that became developmental licensees in 2005 and work on this change of ownership began a couple of years ago. While the Company generally has no capital invested in this type of market, it does receive a royalty based on a percent of sales. The royalty rate varies by market and is based on growth and profitability opportunity within the market. Our plans to change our ownership mix through conventional re-franchising and increased use of developmental licenses will affect our results. The results of Company-operated restaurants are recorded in our consolidated financial statements, and we are responsible for their ongoing capital investments, whereas restaurants operated under franchise or license agreements generate revenue streams without a comparable level of capital investment by us. We do not expect that the financial impact of our plans to adjust our ownership mix will be material in 2006 given the time required to execute these plans. Our plans to convert markets to a developmental license structure depend on our ability to identify prospective licensees with the experience and financial resources to be effective operators of McDonald’s restaurants. We are in the process of identifying potential licensees in some of these markets, but we cannot predict how quickly we will complete transactions. The markets that we have targeted as candidates for developmental licenses had in the aggregate about 1,500 restaurants (predominately Company-operated) and in 2005 had $1.5 billion in sales, $50 million in capital expenditures, $100 million in selling, general & administrative expenses and generated a modest operating loss. At December 31, 2005, the Company’s net investment in these markets was about $1.6 billion. As a result of our annual testing, we recorded impairment charges for some of these markets in the last three years. For others, current cash flows or undiscounted projected cash flows are such that no impairment charges were required. In each case, our impairment testing was based on the assumption that these markets will continue to be operated under the existing ownership structure. We will continue our annual impairment testing for these assets based on this assumption until it becomes probable that a transaction will occur within 12 months, and we can reasonably estimate our sales proceeds. We may not recover our entire net investment in each of these markets and may therefore record losses in future periods as we adjust our ownership mix. The timing and amount of any losses will depend on the circumstances of each transaction. Currently, we do not believe that any significant transactions are likely to be completed within 12 months. While the Company does not provide specific guidance on earnings per share, the following information is provided to assist in analyzing the Company’s results. • Changes in constant currency Systemwide sales are driven by changes in comparable sales and restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add about 1 percentage point to sales growth in 2006 (in constant currencies). Most of this anticipated growth will result from restaurants opened in 2005. • The Company does not provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point increase in U.S. comparable sales would increase annual earnings per share by about 2 cents. Similarly, an increase of 1 percentage point in Europe’s comparable sales would increase annual earnings per share by about 1.5 cents. • The Company expects full-year 2006 selling, general & administrative expenses to increase at a rate less than Systemwide sales, in constant currencies, and to decline as a percent of revenues, compared with 2005 without considering any impact of changes in ownership mix. • A significant part of the Company’s operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 80% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro and the British Pound. If the Euro and the British Pound both move 10% in the same direction compared with 2005, the Company’s annual earnings per share would change about 6 cents to 7 cents. Based on current rates, foreign currency translation is expected to negatively affect earnings in the first quarter 2006. • The Company plans to return to pre-HIA debt and cash levels as we pay down debt over the next couple of years. The late 2005 borrowings, used to fund dividend payments to repatriate earnings back to the U.S. parent-company, resulted in a temporary increase in both cash and debt on our year-end consolidated balance sheet. However, our net debt position (gross debt outstanding less cash available for investment) has improved significantly, excluding this one-time opportunity. The Company expects interest expense in 2006 to increase 7% to 9% compared with 2005, based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We expect this increase will be partly offset by the related higher interest income from cash available for investing, resulting in a 4% to 6% increase in interest expense, net of interest income. 16 McDonald’s Corporation • The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full year 2006 to be approximately 31% to 33%, although some volatility may be experienced between the quarters in the normal course of business. • The Company expects capital expenditures for 2006 to be approximately $1.8 billion. • In 2006 and 2007 combined, the Company expects to return between $5 billion and $6 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends. The Company expects to complete share repurchases of about $1 billion in the first quarter of 2006. • In January 2006, Chipotle completed an initial public offering of 6.1 million shares resulting in proceeds of approximately $120 million to Chipotle. McDonald’s sold 3.0 million Chipotle shares resulting in proceeds to the Company of $61 million, while still remaining the majority shareholder. As a result of the offering, the Company will record a pretax nonoperating gain of about $50 million in the first quarter of 2006. • During the first quarter 2006, the Company has taken certain actions to improve profitability in two challenging markets. In Brazil, we reached an agreement to acquire restaurants operated by several litigating franchisees and expect to incur pretax charges of approximately $20 million. In the U.K., as part of a strategic review of its “high street” locations, the Company has developed a plan that focuses on improving profits of those sites. In connection with that plan, we expect to close 25 restaurants in the U.K. in the first quarter 2006, resulting in lease cancellation and other charges of approximately $40 million pretax.

McDonald’s Corporation 17 Net income and diluted net income per common share In 2005, net income and diluted net income per common share were $2,602 million and $2.04, respectively. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No.123(R) and the related compensation remix, 2005 net income included $130 million or $0.10 per share of share-based and related compensation expense. The 2005 results also included a net tax benefit of $73 million or $0.05 per share comprised of $179 million or $0.14 per share tax benefit due to a favorable audit settlement of the Company’s 2000-2002 U.S. tax returns and $106 million or $0.09 per share of incremental tax expense resulting from the decision to repatriate foreign earnings under HIA. In addition, 2005 included impairment and other charges and credits that netted to $28 million of pretax income ($12 million income after tax or $0.01 of income per share). In 2004, net income and diluted net income per common share were $2,279 million and $1.79, respectively (or $1.68 per share including pro forma share-based compensation expense of $0.11 per share). The 2004 results included pretax operating charges of $160 million ($105 million after tax or $0.08 per share) related to a lease accounting correction and $130 million ($116 million after tax or $0.09 per share) related to asset and goodwill impairment charges, primarily in South Korea. In 2004, results also included pretax nonoperating income of $49 million ($49 million after tax or $0.04 per share) relating to the sale of the Company’s interest in a U.S. real estate partnership that resulted in the utilization of certain previously unrealized capital loss carryforwards. In 2003, net income and diluted net income per common share after cumulative effect of accounting change were $1,471 million and $1.15, respectively (or $0.98 per share including pro forma share-based compensation expense of $0.17 per share). The 2003 results included net pretax charges of $408 million ($323 million after tax or $0.25 per share) primarily related to the disposition of certain non-McDonald’s brands and asset and goodwill impairment, primarily in Latin America. Refer to the Impairment and other charges (credits), net section as well as the Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. For 2005, diluted weighted average shares outstanding were relatively flat compared to 2004. Shares outstanding at the beginning of 2005 were higher than the prior year due to stock options exercised exceeding treasury stock purchased during 2004. Treasury stock purchased in 2005 offset this higher balance as well as the impact of options exercised during the year. In 2004, diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased compared to 2003. Shares outstanding at the beginning of the year were lower than the prior year due to treasury stock purchased exceeding stock options exercised in 2003, partly offset by a higher dilutive effect of stock options outstanding. Impact of foreign currencies on reported results While changing foreign currencies affect reported results, McDonald’s mitigates exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows, and purchasing goods and services in local currencies. In 2005, revenues were positively impacted by the Brazilian Real and the Canadian Dollar, but operating income and net income were minimally impacted by foreign currency translation. The Euro had a minimal impact on reported results.

In the U.S., the increase in revenues in 2005 was driven by multiple initiatives that are delivering variety like our new Premium Chicken Sandwiches, convenience such as cashless payment options and extended hours as well as our continued focus on value. In 2004, the increase in revenues was due to the combined strength of the strategic menu, marketing and service initiatives. Franchised and affiliated revenues increased at a higher rate than Company-operated sales in 2004 due to a higher percentage of franchised restaurants throughout the year compared with 2003. Europe’s increase in revenues for 2005 was due to strong comparable sales in Russia, which is entirely Company-operated, and positive comparable sales in France and Germany, partly offset by negative comparable sales in the U.K. In 2004, the increase in Europe’s revenues was due to strong comparable sales in Russia and positive comparable sales in France, the U.K. and many other markets, partly offset by poor performance in Germany. In APMEA, revenues for 2005 benefited from strong comparable sales in Australia and Taiwan, and were negatively impacted by the conversion of two markets (about 325 restaurants) to developmental licensee structures during 2005. In addition, revenues benefited from expansion in China, partly offset by that market’s negative comparable sales. In 2004, the increase in APMEA’s revenues was due primarily to strong performance in China and Australia as well as positive comparable sales in many other markets, partly offset by poor performance in South Korea. In Latin America, revenues in 2005 and 2004 increased in constant currencies primarily due to positive comparable sales in many markets and a higher percentage of Company-operated restaurants compared with prior years.

Franchised margin dollars represented more than 65% of the combined operating margins in 2005, 2004 and 2003. Franchised margin dollars increased $246 million or 6% (6% in constant currencies) in 2005 and $427 million or 13% (8% in constant currencies) in 2004.

In 2004, the Company-operated margin percent increased primarily due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher commodity costs and higher staffing levels. Commodity cost pressures are expected to ease in 2006. In Europe, the Company-operated margin percent in 2005 decreased due to the U.K., primarily as a result of higher labor costs and negative comparable sales, partly offset by strong performance in Russia. In addition, higher beef costs had a negative impact across the segment for the year. In 2004, Russia’s strong performance also benefited the Company-operated margin percent but was more than offset by weak performance in Germany and the U.K. as well as higher commodity costs across the segment. Commodities are expected to have a slightly negative impact in the first quarter of 2006 and remain relatively flat for the year. In APMEA, the Company-operated margin percent in both 2005 and 2004 was negatively impacted by weak results in South Korea, partly offset by improvements in Hong Kong. In addition, 2004 benefited from improved performance in Australia and China. In Latin America, the Company-operated margin percent in both years reflected improved performance, driven by strong comparable sales in Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela. 20 McDonald’s Corporation • Supplemental information regarding Company-operated McDonald’s restaurants As noted earlier, we continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance, profits and returns. Although direct restaurant operation is more capital-intensive relative to franchising and results in lower operating margins as a percent of revenues, Company-operated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets. In our Company-operated restaurants, we can develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that we introduce Systemwide only those that we believe are most beneficial. In addition, we firmly believe that owning restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor. Like other restaurant companies, we report results for Company-operated restaurants based on their sales, less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs, and we report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues, less associated occupancy costs. For this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure, we do not specifically allocate selling, general & administrative expenses and other operating (income) expenses to Company-operated or franchised restaurants. Other operating items that relate to the Company-operated restaurants generally include gains on sales of restaurant businesses and, to a lesser extent, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements. We believe that the following supplemental information regarding our Company-operated restaurants in our most mature and significant markets will assist investors in understanding the performance of this business as if it were operated as franchised restaurants. While this analysis would shift certain revenues and costs between Company-operated and franchised margins, consolidated operating margins would not change. In our Company-operated margins, our occupancy expense (outside rent expense and depreciation for buildings & leasehold improvements) would be replaced by rents and service fees comparable to those paid by franchisees. Since selling, general & administrative expenses are not specifically allocated to the Company-operated restaurant business, an estimate of costs to support this business was made by the U.S., Canada and our three major markets in Europe. We believe, on average, a range of $40,000 to $50,000 per restaurant is typical, but will vary depending on local circumstances and the structure of the market. These costs reflect the support services we believe are necessary to provide the best customer experience. Other selling, general & administrative costs to support the brand would be covered by a service fee charged to this business.

McDonald’s Corporation 21 Selling, general & administrative expenses Consolidated selling, general & administrative expenses increased 12% in 2005 and 8% in 2004 (11% and 5% in constant currencies). The share-based and related incremental compensation expense due to the adoption of SFAS No.123(R) accounted for a majority of the constant currency increase in 2005. The constant currency increase in 2004 reflected higher performance-based incentive compensation. Selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of revenues were 10.9% in 2005 compared with 10.4% in 2004 and 10.7% in 2003, and selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales were 4.1% in 2005 compared with 3.9% in 2004 and 4.0% in 2003. The share-based and related incremental compensation expense increased these ratios 0.9 percentage points and 0.3 percentage points, respectively, in 2005. Management believes that analyzing selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales, as well as revenues, is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support Systemwide restaurants.

(2) Certain items were not tax effected. • Restaurant closings/impairment In 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded $23 million and $130 million of pretax charges for impairment, respectively, primarily due to South Korea and its continued poor results. In 2003, the Company recorded $136 million of net pretax charges consisting of: $148 million primarily related to impairment in Latin America; $30 million for about 50 restaurant closings associated with strategic actions in Latin America; and a $42 million favorable adjustment to the 2002 charge for restaurant closings, primarily due to about 85 fewer closings than originally anticipated. • Restructuring In 2005, the Company recorded $51 million of pretax income, primarily due to favorable adjustments related to the conversion of a market to a developmental licensee in APMEA and certain liabilities established in 2001 and 2002 due to lower than originally anticipated employee-related and lease termination costs. In 2003, the Company recorded $272 million of pretax charges consisting of: $237 million related to the loss on the sale of Donatos Pizzeria, the closing of all Donatos and Boston Market restaurants outside the U.S. and the exit of a domestic joint venture with Fazoli’s; and $35 million related to revitalization plan actions of McDonald’s Japan. • Lease accounting correction During 2004, like other companies in the restaurant and retail industries, the Company reviewed its accounting practices and policies with respect to leasing transactions. Following this review and in consultation with its external auditors, the Company corrected an error in its prior practices to conform the lease term used in calculating straight-line rent expense with the term used to amortize improvements on leased property. The result of the correction primarily accelerated the recognition of rent expense under certain leases that include fixed-rent escalations by revising the computation of straight-line rent expense to include these escalations for certain option periods. As the correction related solely to accounting treatment, it did not affect McDonald’s historical or future cash flows or the timing of payments under the related leases. Its effect on the Company’s earning per share, cash from operations and shareholders’ equity was immaterial. These adjustments primarily impacted the U.S., China, Boston Market and Chipotle. Other markets were less significantly impacted, as many of the leases outside of the U.S. do not contain fixed-rent escalations.

The Company’s purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees and affiliates are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business. • Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates—businesses in which the Company actively participates but does not control—is reported after interest expense and income taxes, except for U.S. restaurant partnerships, which are reported before income taxes. Results in 2005 decreased primarily due to results at our Japanese affiliate, which included a one-time adjustment for restaurant employees’ back pay. The increase in 2004 was primarily due to stronger performance in the U.S. and improved results from our Japanese affiliate. • Asset dispositions and other expense Asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for contingencies and uncollectible receivables and other miscellaneous expenses. Asset dispositions and other expense for 2005 reflected lower losses on asset dispositions and lower costs to acquire restaurants owned by litigating franchisees in Brazil. Asset dispositions and other expense in 2004 reflected higher losses on asset dispositions compared with 2003, certain costs incurred to acquire restaurants operated by litigating franchisees in Brazil and provisions for certain contingencies.

(2) Calculated by subtracting pro forma share-based expense from reported operating income. The following discussion on Operating income relates to pro forma increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation in the table above. In 2005 and 2004, U.S. operating income included higher combined operating margin dollars compared to 2004 and 2003, respectively. Selling, general & administrative expense in 2005 was higher partly due to certain information technology expenses previously recorded in the Corporate segment. Other operating expense decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 and increased in 2004 compared to 2003 due to higher asset dispositions in 2004. In 2004, operating income included charges related to the lease accounting correction of $70 million as well as impairment charges of $10 million. In Europe, results for 2005 reflected strong performance in France and Russia, improved performance in Germany and weak results in the U.K. In addition, results included a supply chain charge of $24 million, which negatively impacted the operating income growth rate by approximately 2 percentage points. In 2004, results benefited from strong performances in France and Russia as well as improved performance in Italy, offset by weak results in the U.K. and Germany. In addition, 2004 results included impairment charges of $25 million. In APMEA, results for 2005 were positively impacted by strong performance in Australia partly offset by weak results in Japan, China and South Korea. In 2004, operating income also benefited from Australia’s performance as well as improved performance in Hong Kong and China, partly offset by poor results in South Korea. Results for 2004 also included charges related to the lease accounting correction of $46 million as well as impairment charges of $93 million. In Latin America, results for 2005 improved due to continued strong sales performance in most markets as well as lower costs to acquire restaurants owned by litigating franchisees in Brazil when compared to 2004. In 2004, Latin America’s operating loss decreased as compared with 2003, due to impairment charges in 2003 as well as significantly lower provisions for uncollectible receivables and improved performance in Venezuela and Argentina. In addition, operating income in 2004 included certain costs incurred to acquire restaurants owned by litigating franchisees in Brazil. In the Corporate segment, results for 2005 benefited from lower share-based compensation, certain information technology expenses that are now reflected in the U.S. segment, lower incentive-based compensation and a favorable adjustment to certain liabilities established in 2001 and 2002 due to lower than originally anticipated employee-related and lease termination costs. Interest expense Interest expense for 2005 reflected higher average interest rates and lower average debt levels. HIA debt borrowed late in the fourth quarter had a minimal impact on the average debt levels for 2005. Interest expense decreased in 2004 due to lower average debt levels and interest rates, partly offset by stronger foreign currencies.

McDonald’s Corporation 25 Provision for income taxes In 2005, 2004 and 2003, the reported effective income tax rates were 29.7%, 28.9% and 35.7%, respectively. In 2005, the effective tax rate included a benefit of $179 million due to a favorable audit settlement of the Company’s 2000-2002 U.S. tax returns, partly offset by additional expense of approximately $106 million related to the Company’s decision to take advantage of the one-time opportunity provided under HIA to repatriate certain foreign earnings. The net of both items benefited the 2005 effective tax rate by about 2 percentage points. The effective income tax rate for the full year 2004 benefited from an international transaction and the utilization of certain previously unrealized capital loss carryforwards. In 2003, the effective income tax rate included a benefit of $102 million due to a favorable audit settlement of the Company’s 1997–1999 U.S. tax returns, as well as certain asset impairment and other charges that were not tax affected. Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1,111 million in 2005 and $1,319 million in 2004. Substantially all of the net tax assets arose in the U.S. and other profitable markets. Accounting changes • SFAS Statement No.123(R) Effective January 1, 2005, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.123(R) using the modified-prospective transition method. Under this transition method, compensation cost in 2005 includes the portion vesting in the period for (1) all share-based payments granted prior to, but not vested as of January 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and (2) all share-based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.123(R). Results for prior periods have not been restated. Refer to the Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this item. In 2005, in connection with its adoption of SFAS No.123(R), the Company adjusted the mix of employee long-term incentive compensation by reducing stock options awarded and increasing cash-based incentives and other equity based awards. For the year ended 2005, results included pretax expense of $191 million (or $0.10 per share after tax) of which $154 million related to share-based compensation and $37 million related to the compensation shift. • Cumulative effect of accounting change Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time the obligations are incurred. The ongoing annual impact of this statement is not material to the Company. CASH FLOWS The Company generates significant cash from operations and has substantial credit capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchase. Cash from operations totaled $4.3 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $2.7 billion in 2005, while cash from operations totaled $3.9 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $2.5 billion in 2004. Cash provided by operations increased $433 million in 2005 and $635 million in 2004 due to strong operating results, primarily in the U.S., and changes in working capital. The changes in working capital in 2005 benefited from lower income tax payments compared with the prior year. The Company expects to have higher income tax payments in 2006. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.8 billion in 2005, an increase of $435 million primarily due to higher capital expenditures and increased purchases of restaurant businesses. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.4 billion in 2004, flat compared with 2003, due to higher capital expenditures and lower sales of property, offset by lower purchases of restaurant businesses. Cash from financing activities totaled $362 million in 2005, an increase of $2.0 billion primarily due to $2.9 billion of local borrowings related to HIA and higher proceeds from employee stock option exercises. The increase was partly offset by higher share repurchases, higher debt repayments and an increase in the common stock dividend. In 2004, cash used for financing activities totaled $1.6 billion, a decrease of $103 million primarily due to higher proceeds from employee stock option exercises and lower debt repayments, partly offset by higher share repurchases and an increase in the common stock dividend. As a result of the above activity, the Company’s cash and equivalents balance increased $2.9 billion in 2005 to $4.3 billion, compared to an increase of $887 million in 2004. The Company plans to return to pre-HIA cash levels over the next couple of years as we use this cash to fund capital expenditures under our remodeling initiatives, new restaurants openings and salaries in the U.S. In addition to cash and equivalents and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. Restaurant development and capital expenditures In 2005, the Company opened 558 traditional McDonald’s restaurants and 120 satellite restaurants (small, limited-menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 145 traditional restaurants and 263 satellite restaurants. In 2004, the Company opened 430 traditional McDonald’s restaurants and 198 satellite restaurants, and closed 185 traditional restaurants and 134 satellite restaurants. About 85% and 70% of McDonald’s net restaurant additions occurred in the major markets in 2005 and 2004, respectively. 26 McDonald’s Corporation Systemwide restaurants at year end(1) 2005 2004 2003 U.S. 13,727 13,673 13,609 Europe 6,352 6,287 6,186 APMEA 7,692 7,567 7,475 Latin America 1,617 1,607 1,578 Canada 1,378 1,362 1,339 Other 1,120 1,065 942 Total 31,886 31,561 31,129 (1) Includes satellite units at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 as follows: U.S.–1,268, 1,341, 1,307; Europe–190, 181, 150; APMEA (primarily Japan)–1,730, 1,819, 1,841; Latin America–8,13, 20; and Canada–395, 378, 350. In 2006, the Company expects to open about 700 traditional McDonald’s restaurants and 100 satellite restaurants and close about 225 traditional restaurants and 125 satellite restaurants. Approximately 65% of Company-operated restaurants and more than 85% of franchised and affiliated restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2005. Franchisees and affiliates operated 73% of McDonald’s restaurants at year-end 2005. Non-McDonald’s brand restaurants are primarily Company-operated. Capital expenditures increased $188 million or 13% in 2005 and $112 million or 9% in 2004. The increase in capital expenditures in 2005 was primarily due to increased investment in existing restaurants, primarily in the U.S. The increase in capital expenditures in 2004 was also due to increased investment in existing restaurants, primarily in the U.S. and Europe, partly offset by lower expenditures on restaurant openings. Capital expenditures in both years reflects the Company’s focus on growing sales at existing restaurants, including reinvestment initiatives such as reimaging in several markets around the world. Capital expenditures invested in major markets, excluding Japan, represented about 70% of the total in 2005, 2004 and 2003. Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts.

New restaurant investments in both 2005 and 2004 were concentrated in markets with acceptable returns and/or opportunities for long-term growth. Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies and leveraging best practices. In addition, foreign currency fluctuations affect average development costs. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs on every restaurant opened, in 2005 total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonald’s restaurants averaged approximately $1.9 million in the U.S. and approximately $1.7 million in the 9 markets where development was concentrated outside the U.S. For 2006, the U.S., China and eight other consolidated markets are expected to account for about 75% of restaurant openings. The Company and its affiliates owned 37% of the land and 59% of the buildings for its restaurants at year-end 2005 and 2004. Share repurchases and dividends For the past three years, the Company has returned a significant amount of cash to shareholders through shares repurchased and dividends. In 2006 and 2007 combined, the Company expects to return between $5 billion and $6 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends. The Company expects to complete share repurchases of about $1 billion in the first quarter of 2006. Shares repurchased and dividends IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA 2005 2004 2003 Number of shares repurchased 39.5 22.2 18.9 Dividends declared per share $ .67 $ .55 $ .40 Dollar amount of shares repurchased $ 1,228 $ 605 $ 439 Dividends $ 842 $ 695 $ 504 Total cash returned to shareholders $ 2,070 $ 1,300 $ 943 The Company repurchases shares of its common stock under a $5.0 billion share repurchase program authorized in 2001. Through 2005, 100.7 million shares have been repurchased for $2.8 billion under this program. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 30 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. In 2005, the Company declared a 22% per share increase in the annual dividend to $0.67 per share or $842 million, reflecting the Company’s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. This represents a 185% increase from the 2002 dividend. As in the past, future dividends will be considered after reviewing dividend yields, profitability expectations and financing needs and will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Cash dividends are declared and paid on an annual basis. McDonald’s Corporation 27 FINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Total assets and returns Total assets grew by $2.2 billion or 8% in 2005 and $2.0 billion or 8% in 2004. Total assets in 2005 included $2.9 billion of cash borrowed under HIA, partly offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which decreased total assets by approximately $1.3 billion in 2005. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased total assets by $1.0 billion in 2004. Nearly 65% of consolidated assets were located in the major markets at year-end 2005. Net property and equipment decreased $795 million in 2005 and represented 66% of total assets at year end. Operating income, which excludes interest income, is used to compute return on average assets, while income before the cumulative effect of accounting changes is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. Returns on assets and equity 2005 2004 2003 Return on average assets(1) 14.4 % 13.4 % 11.4 % Return on average common equity 17.8 17.8 13.3 (1) Return on average assets was negatively impacted by significantly higher cash and equivalents balances due in part to the Company’s planning related to HIA and subsequent repatriation of earnings in 2005. Cash and equivalents reduced return on average assets by 1.2 percentage points, 0.6 percentage points and 0.1 percentage points in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Impairment and other charges reduced return on average assets by 0.9 percentage points in 2004 and 1.4 percentage points in 2003. In addition, these charges reduced return on average common equity by 1.3 percentage points in 2004 and 2.8 percentage points in 2003. In 2005 and 2004, return on average assets and return on average common equity both benefited from strong operating results in the U.S. In addition, returns in 2004 benefited from improved results in Europe. In 2005, return on average common equity reflected the same percentage increase in both net income and average shareholders’ equity (driven by the significant increase in shareholders’ equity at the end of 2004 compared with 2003). During 2006, the Company will continue to concentrate McDonald’s restaurant openings and new capital invested in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long-term growth, such as China. In addition, the Company expects to return between $5 billion and $6 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends in 2006 and 2007 combined. Financing and market risk The Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2005 totaled $10.1 billion, compared with $9.2 billion at December 31, 2004. The net increase in 2005 was due to net issuances related to HIA ($2.9 billion), partly offset by net payments ($1.2 billion), the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt ($580 million) and the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133) noncash fair value adjustments ($112 million).

See Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements. (3) Includes the effect of interest rate and foreign currency exchange agreements. (4) HIA-related borrowings caused an 18 percentage point decrease in fixed-rate debt in 2005. (5) HIA-related borrowings caused an 8 percentage point increase in foreign currency-denominated debt in 2005. Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch currently rate the Company’s commercial paper P-1, A-1 and F1, respectively; and its long-term debt A2, A and A, respectively. Historically, the Company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt. The Company’s key metrics for monitoring its credit structure are shown in the preceding table. While the Company targets these metrics for ease of focus, it also looks at similar credit ratios that incorporate capitalized operating leases to estimate total adjusted debt. Total adjusted debt is a term that is commonly used by the rating agencies referred to above, which includes debt outstanding on the Company’s balance sheet plus an adjustment to capitalize operating leases. Based on their most recent calculations, these agencies add between $7 billion and $10 billion of debt for lease capitalization purposes. The Company believes the rating agency methodology for capitalizing leases requires certain adjustments. These adjustments include: excluding percent rents in excess of minimum rents; excluding certain Company-operated restaurant lease agreements outside the U.S. that are cancelable with minimal penalties (representing approximately 25% of Company-operated restaurant leases outside the U.S., based on the Company’s estimate); capitalizing non-restaurant leases using a multiple of three times rent expense; and reducing total rent expense by a percentage of the annual minimum rent payments due to the Company from franchisees operating 28 McDonald’s Corporation on leased sites. Based on this calculation, for credit analysis purposes approximately $4 billion to $5 billion of future operating lease payments would be capitalized. Certain of the Company’s debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company’s business. The Company has $1.3 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement (see Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements) as well as approximately $1.4 billion under a U.S. shelf registration and $416 million under a Euro Medium-Term Notes program for future debt issuance. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All exchange agreements are over-the-counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. All derivatives were recorded at fair value in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2005 and 2004 primarily in miscellaneous other assets ($83 million and $102 million, respectively) and other long-term liabilities ($103 million and $218 million, respectively). See Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments for additional information regarding their use and the impact of SFAS No.133 regarding derivatives. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. In 2005, the Company used foreign currency debt to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated cash and equivalents related to HIA. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt, including the effects of foreign currency exchange agreements, was $8.1 billion and $6.6 billion for the years ended 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company was required to post collateral of $24 million and $46 million, respectively. The Company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Company’s largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures IN MILLIONS OF U.S. DOLLARS 2005 2004 Euro $ 2,073 $ 2,453 Canadian Dollars 1,070 964 British Pounds Sterling 822 1,086 Australian Dollars 682 880 Brazilian Reais 395 372 The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the U.S. Based on the results of these analyses of the Company’s financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2005 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2005 levels would materially affect the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. Contractual obligations and commitments The Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2005. (See discussions of Cash flows and Financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.)

Debt obligations do not include $191 million of SFAS No.133 noncash fair value adjustments. This effect is excluded as these adjustments ultimately have no impact on the obligation at maturity. The Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of Internal Revenue Service limitations. The investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market-rate investment alternatives under the Company’s qualified Profit Sharing and Savings Plan. Total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $366 million at December 31, 2005 and $350 million at December 31, 2004 and were included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. In addition to long-term obligations, the Company had guaranteed certain affiliate and other loans totaling $46 million at December 31, 2005. OTHER MATTERS Critical accounting policies and estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgements based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions. The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgement and/or complexity. • Property and equipment Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods. • Share-based compensation The Company has share-based compensation plans which authorize the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options, restricted stock and RSUs to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and amortized over their vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions such as the expected life of the stock option and expected volatility of the Company’s stock over the expected life, which significantly impact the assumed fair value. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. • Long-lived assets impairment review Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Company’s long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. The biggest assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgements based on the Company’s experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. If the Company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. 30 McDonald’s Corporation Losses on assets held for sale are recognized when management has approved and committed to a plan to sell the assets, the assets are available for sale and probable of occurring within 12 months and the net sales proceeds from the assets are expected to be less than its net book value. • Litigation accruals From time to time, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgements or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. • Income taxes The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. During 2005, the Company recorded a $179 million benefit due to favorable audit settlement of the Company’s 2000–2002 U.S. tax returns. During 2003, the Company recorded a $102 million benefit due to favorable audit settlement of the Company’s 1997-1999 tax returns. The Company’s 2003-2004 U.S. tax returns are under audit. The audit is expected to be completed in late 2006 or early 2007 and no estimate can be made of the benefit or charge, if any, resulting from the completion of the audit. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for basis differences totaling $3.9 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. The basis differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in the businesses. If management’s intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. Effects of changing prices–inflation The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. Reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management to determine the effectiveness of capital deployed. ROIIC is calculated as a percentage and is calculated on a one-year basis and a three-year basis. The numerator is the Company’s constant foreign exchange rate (excludes the impact of foreign currency translation) incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization, based on a comparison of the current and base periods. The denominator is the constant foreign exchange rate weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one- or three-year period. Adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less net cash (collections) and issuances of notes receivable, which do not generate operating income. Constant foreign exchange rate weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis detailed in the tables below. These weightings reflect the relative contribution of each quarter’s investing activities to constant foreign exchange rate incremental operating income. Once the weightings are applied to the adjusted cash used for investing activities in each quarter, the results are aggregated to arrive at the weighted average adjusted cash used for investing activities. Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average.

63908,MCD,MCDONALDS CORP,2007,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Description of the business The Company primarily franchises and operates McDonald’s restaurants. In addition, the Company operates and has investments in certain non-McDonald’s brands that are not material to the Company’s overall results. Of the 31,046 McDonald’s restaurants in 118 countries at year-end 2006, 18,685 are operated by franchisees (including 1,091 operated by developmental licensees), 4,195 are operated by affiliates and 8,166 are operated by the Company. Under our conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the required capital by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and décor of their restaurant businesses, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and franchised restaurant sites. This ensures long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and improves alignment with franchisees. Under our developmental license arrangement, licensees provide ongoing capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, while the Company generally has no capital invested. We view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and continually review our restaurant ownership mix (that is our mix among Company-operated, franchised - conventional or developmental license, and joint venture) to deliver a great customer experience and drive profitability. In most cases, franchising is the best way to achieve both goals. Although direct restaurant operation is more capital-intensive relative to franchising and results in lower operating margins as a percent of revenues, Company-operated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets. In our Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with our franchisees, we further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that we introduce Systemwide only those that we believe are most beneficial. In addition, we firmly believe that owning restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor. Our Company-operated business also helps to facilitate changes in restaurant ownership as warranted by strategic considerations. Revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates. These fees primarily include rent, service fees and/or royalties that are based on a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. The business is managed as distinct geographic segments: United States; Europe; Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA); Latin America; and Canada. In addition, throughout this report we present a segment entitled “Corporate & Other” that includes Corporate activities and non-McDonald’s brands (e.g., Boston Market). The U.S. and Europe segments each account for approximately 35% of total revenues. France, Germany and the United Kingdom (U.K.), collectively, account for approximately 60% of Europe’s revenues; and Australia, China and Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), collectively, account for nearly 50% of APMEA’s revenues. These six markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as “major markets” throughout this report and comprise approximately 70% of total revenues. During 2006, the Company disposed of its entire investment in Chipotle Mexican Grill (Chipotle) via public stock offerings and a tax-free exchange for McDonald’s common stock. As a result of the complete disposition of Chipotle, the Company has reflected Chipotle’s results for all years shown as discontinued operations, including gains from the disposition in 2006. In analyzing business trends, management considers a variety of performance and financial measures including comparable sales growth, Systemwide sales growth, operating margins and returns. • Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain compensation plans on these results because we believe they better represent the underlying business trends. • Comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the Company’s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for all McDonald’s restaurants in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include road construction, reimaging or remodeling, and natural disasters. McDonald’s reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays, weekend days and timing of holidays in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales. The Company refers to this impact as the calendar shift/trading day adjustment. This impact varies geographically due to consumer spending patterns and has the greatest impact on monthly comparable sales. Typically, the annual impact is minimal, with the exception of leap years. • Systemwide sales include sales at all McDonald’s and Boston Market restaurants, whether operated by the Company, by franchisees or by affiliates. While sales by franchisees and affiliates are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company’s financial performance because it is the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised and affiliated revenues and is indicative of the financial health of our franchisee base. • Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the adjusted cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation assumes a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. 11 Table of Contents Strategic direction and financial performance The unique business relationship among the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the System) has been key to McDonald’s success over the years. This business model enables McDonald’s to play an integral role in the communities we serve and consistently deliver relevant restaurant experiences to customers. In addition, our strategic alignment facilitates our ability to implement innovative ideas and profitably grow our business. The Company is focused on increasing McDonald’s relevance to consumers through the execution of multiple initiatives under our Plan to Win in order to be better, not just bigger. This plan is designed to deliver operational excellence and leadership marketing leveraged around five key drivers of exceptional customer experiences - people, products, place, price and promotion. Our long-term financial targets include average annual Systemwide sales and revenue growth of 3% to 5%; average annual operating income growth of 6% to 7%; and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens. These targets exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. Since implementing our Plan to Win, we improved the taste of many of our menu items and have introduced a variety of new menu choices such as premium salads, premium burgers and additional chicken offerings in many markets worldwide. We appeal to a broad range of customer preferences using a locally relevant three-tier menu strategy featuring premium salad and sandwich selections, classic menu favorites and everyday affordable offerings. We strive for continuous improvement in our training programs and restaurant execution through a comprehensive restaurant operations improvement process to enable and motivate franchisees and restaurant employees to improve the customer experience. In addition, our “i’m lovin’ it” global marketing theme continues to evolve to extend our marketing reach to consumers via print, billboards and digital communications in addition to television advertising. These efforts have increased our consumer relevance and delivered strong results in each of the last three years with revenue growth, operating income growth and returns on incremental invested capital meeting or exceeding our long-term financial targets. In addition, we demonstrated our commitment to shareholders by returning $8.3 billion to shareholders through dividends paid and shares acquired from 2004 through 2006. In 2006, the Company’s increased relevance contributed to more customers visiting our restaurants, helping drive global comparable sales up 5.7% and extending our consecutive monthly increases to 44 months through December 2006. The momentum of our U.S. business continued as a result of further strengthening our robust breakfast business and expanding our beverage, salad and chicken offerings, including the successful introductions of Premium Roast Coffee, the Asian Salad and the Snack Wrap. Initiatives such as reimaging restaurants, extending operating hours and providing cashless payment options helped make McDonald’s more inviting and convenient for customers. In Europe, we built momentum using locally relevant menu offerings such as premium burgers and classic menu favorites, as well as value platforms such as Ein Mal Eins in Germany and Pound Saver in the U.K. The markets provided predictable menu choice and variety through popular food promotions, and engaged consumers with innovative marketing. Europe’s results were driven by strong performance in France, Germany and most other markets as well as significantly improved performance in the U.K. We also made progress improving consumer perceptions in Europe, including the U.K., by aggressively communicating McDonald’s food quality, nutrition and employment facts. In addition, to enhance local relevance by having local franchisees operate more restaurants and to improve returns, we reduced our percentage of Company-operated restaurants in the U.K. from 63% at the end of 2005 to 54% at the end of 2006. We are encouraged by our momentum in Europe and confident that our combined initiatives designed to enhance the customers’ experience will continue to drive growth over the long term. In APMEA, Systemwide sales and revenue growth were primarily driven by strong comparable sales in Japan and Australia and new restaurant expansion and positive comparable sales in China. Strategic menu pricing in Japan and China contributed to this segment’s performance. In 2006, we also entered into a strategic alliance with Sinopec, China’s largest petroleum retailer. This agreement provides us the opportunity to co-develop drive-thru restaurants at existing and new Sinopec locations, positioning us to capitalize on changing consumer lifestyles in China. We believe that the long-term growth potential for our business in China is substantial and we are well-positioned to capture the opportunity. We continue to focus our management and financial resources on the core McDonald’s business as the opportunities for growth remain significant. Accordingly, during 2006, we disposed of our entire investment in Chipotle via public stock offerings and an October tax-free exchange for McDonald’s common stock. These transactions provided the Company with $329 million in cash proceeds and facilitated the acquisition of 18.6 million shares of McDonald’s stock via the exchange. In 2006, our strong global performance generated $4.3 billion of cash provided by operations. About $1.7 billion of this cash was reinvested in our business primarily to remodel existing restaurants and build new ones. We increased our annual dividend nearly 50% to $1 per share. We also acquired 98.4 million shares through both shares repurchased and shares accepted in connection with the Chipotle exchange. In addition, we paid down $2.3 billion of debt in 2006 reducing the 2005 increase related to the Homeland Investment Act. To improve local relevance, profitability and returns, we continually evaluate ownership structures in our markets. The ownership mix in a given market depends on current and potential results, the risks associated with operating in certain countries, and legal and regulatory constraints. As part of this evaluation, in 2006, we established a target of having less than 30% Company-operated restaurants in each of our major consolidated markets and began working toward this goal, specifically in the U.K. and Canada. For certain markets like China, we believe owning and operating the restaurants is prudent until the legal environment in these countries becomes more conducive to franchising. In addition to our franchising efforts discussed above, we have identified markets with about 2,300 restaurants collectively, primarily Company-operated restaurants in Latin America and APMEA, that we intend to transition to a developmental license structure. Under a developmental license, a local entrepreneur owns the business, including controlling the real estate, and uses his/her capital and local knowledge to build the Brand and optimize sales and profitability over the long term. Under this arrangement, the Company collects a royalty, which varies by market, based on a percent of sales, but does not invest any capital. During 2006, this royalty averaged about five percent of sales. We have successfully used this structure for more than 15 years, and currently have 36 countries that are solely operated by developmental licensees. In addition to the financial benefits the Company achieves when markets are developmentally licensed 12 Table of Contents such as reduced capital spending, improved returns and a stable stream of royalties, this strategy allows the local owner to improve relevance and accelerate growth in the market, and allows management to focus most of their time and energy on the markets that have the largest impact on results. Highlights from the year included: • Comparable sales increased 5.7% building on a 3.9% increase in 2005. • Systemwide sales increased 7% both as reported and in constant currencies. • Consolidated revenues increased 9% (7% in constant currencies). • Income from continuing operations per common share was $2.30 compared with $2.03 in 2005, an increase of 13%. • Cash provided by operations totaled $4.3 billion and capital expenditures totaled $1.7 billion. • The Company increased the annual dividend nearly 50% to $1.00 per share, or $1.2 billion in total. The Company also acquired 98.4 million shares for $3.7 billion, driving a reduction of about 5% of total shares outstanding at year end compared with 2005. • One-year ROIIC was 24.9% and three-year ROIIC was 41.3% for 2006. Outlook for 2007 The McDonald’s System is energized by our current momentum. We intend to build on this momentum by further enhancing every element of the Brand experience and strengthening our connection with customers to capture the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead. We will do this by continuing to execute our Plan to Win with a strategic focus on our customers and restaurants, while continuing to exercise disciplined financial management. We are confident that our Plan to be better, not just bigger, supported by the alignment of our unique system of franchisees and suppliers, will continue to drive enduring profitable growth. Our financial targets, previously discussed, focus management on those opportunities that best optimize shareholder value over the long term. In 2007, we will continue to leverage our three-tier menu approach featuring premium selections, core menu favorites and everyday affordable offerings to appeal to a broad range of consumers. We will complement this three-tier strategy with permanent and limited time offerings of new products that enhance menu choice, variety and value. In the U.S., our strategies focus on chicken, breakfast, beverages and convenience. We are introducing Snack Wrap variations and the new Southwest Salad as well as additional breakfast offerings. We will also enhance the drive-thru experience by continuing to optimize the layout of restaurant interiors and exteriors. In Europe, we will continue to attract customers with a variety of new food offerings, such as Premium Chicken Sandwiches and Snack Wraps, while leveraging the strength of our everyday affordability platforms. Building greater brand trust will remain a priority in Europe with ongoing aggressive communication efforts surrounding our food quality, nutrition and employment image. In addition, we will focus on remodeling restaurants and improving operations to enhance local relevance and upgrade the customer experience. In APMEA, where a large percentage of the population already eats breakfast away from home, we are introducing or expanding breakfast as well as extending restaurant operating hours. We will also continue to reinforce everyday value offerings and work on optimizing our menu pricing structure to enhance profitability. We will continue to support consumers’ desire to make balanced lifestyle choices by educating them about our food’s nutritional value and encouraging greater physical activity. We added nutrition labeling to the packaging of many of our branded core menu items in more than 25,000 restaurants worldwide by the end of 2006. We will extend this effort to cover even more restaurants and products in 2007. We will also continue to play a leadership role in addressing children’s well-being as we pursue initiatives designed to positively affect children’s choice and activity. This includes committing a large portion of our children’s marketing budget toward communications that encourage kids to be more active – physically and mentally. We will also work to further enhance the customer experience by refining and executing our restaurant operations improvement process and expanding the use of our new point of sale software (POS), which was in approximately 8,400 restaurants as of year-end 2006. Tests indicate this new POS helps improve order accuracy and drive-thru service speed. In addition, we will continue developing a new flexible operating system that takes a modular “plug and play” approach to kitchen configuration and restaurant operations. In the future, this system will enable greater menu flexibility based on local market needs while making it easier for crew to satisfy customers. Due to our expectations for continued strong results, relatively stable capital expenditures over the next few years, and the Company’s intent on maintaining current debt-to-capital levels of 35% to 40%, we believe that cash available for dividends and share repurchases will continue to grow. We expect our share repurchase activity will continue to yield reductions in share count in the years ahead given our reduction in equity compensation and fewer stock options outstanding, compared to prior years. In 2007, we will continue to reduce the percentage of Company-operated restaurants in the U.K. and Canada, and we will continue to pursue the developmental license strategy described earlier. The previously mentioned 2,300 restaurants identified for potential conversion to developmental licensees represented nearly $3 billion in sales in 2006, but only generated $30 million in operating income after impairment and other charges. To achieve these results, we spent about $180 million in selling, general & administrative expenses and invested more than $100 million in capital expenditures. As appropriate, we may license some of these markets as a group to a single developmental licensee. These 2,300 restaurants are about 75% Company-operated and represent about $3 billion in combined net investment, which includes approximately $800 million in accumulated currency translation losses reflected in shareholders’ equity on our balance sheet. Our intent is to complete these transactions by the end of 2008. If we are able to complete these transactions, we do not anticipate recovering either the $800 million in historical currency translation losses or most of the remaining $2.2 billion in net book value in the form of sales proceeds, and therefore, we expect that the loss, in the aggregate, would be significant. We will continue impairment testing for these assets annually and as otherwise required by applicable accounting standards. In particular, our annual impairment testing for these assets is based on the assumption that these markets will continue to be operated under the existing ownership structure until it becomes probable that a transaction will occur within 12 months, and we can reasonably estimate our sales proceeds. The timing and amount of any loss for a particular transaction will depend on individual circumstances. In 2006, we completed the transfer of 121 restaurants in four markets to developmental licensees and recorded pretax losses totaling $36 million related to this strategy. 13 Table of Contents While the Company does not provide specific guidance on net income per share, the following information is provided to assist in analyzing the Company’s results: • Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add slightly more than 1 percentage point to 2007 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies), most of which will be due to the 359 net traditional McDonald’s restaurants added during 2006. In 2007, the Company expects to open about 800 McDonald’s restaurants (700 traditional and 100 satellites). We expect net additions of about 400 (450 net traditional additions and 50 net satellite closings). • The Company does not provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point increase in U.S. comparable sales would increase annual net income per share by about 2.5 cents. Similarly, an increase of 1 percentage point in Europe’s comparable sales would increase annual net income per share by about 2 cents. • The primary food commodities impacting McDonald’s business are beef and chicken. In 2007, U.S. beef costs are expected to be down slightly, while we expect U.S. chicken costs to rise. In Europe, both beef and chicken costs are expected to increase slightly in 2007. • The Company expects full-year 2007 selling, general & administrative expenses to decline modestly as a percent of revenues and Systemwide sales compared with 2006. • A significant part of the Company’s operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 80% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro and the British Pound. If the Euro and the British Pound both move 10% in the same direction compared with 2006, the Company’s annual net income per share would change by about 7 cents to 8 cents. • In 2007, based on current business performance and plans, the Company expects to maintain a debt-to-capital ratio of 35% to 40%. Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense in 2007 to remain relatively flat compared with 2006, while it expects interest income to decrease about 40% to 50% due to lower cash balances. • The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2007 to be approximately 31% to 33%, although some volatility may be experienced between the quarters in the normal course of business. • The Company expects capital expenditures for 2007 to be approximately $1.9 billion. About half of this amount will be reinvested in existing restaurants while the rest will primarily be used to build new restaurants. • In 2006, the Company returned nearly $5 billion to shareholders. In 2007 and 2008 combined, the Company expects to return at least an additional $5 billion through a combination of share repurchases and dividends.

During 2006, the Company disposed of its entire investment in Chipotle via public stock offerings and a tax-free exchange for McDonald’s common stock and as a result, has reflected Chipotle’s results of operations and transaction gains as discontinued operations. The 2006 results included $671 million of income, or $0.53 per share, related to discontinued operations. Income from continuing operations was $2.9 billion or $2.30 per share, which included impairment and other charges of $134 million ($98 million after tax or $0.07 per share), as well as net incremental tax expense of $0.01 per share primarily related to a one-time impact from a tax law change in Canada. In 2005, net income and diluted net income per common share were $2.6 billion and $2.04. Income from discontinued operations was $16 million or $0.01 per share, while income from continuing operations was $2.6 billion or $2.03 per share. The 2005 results from continuing operations included a net tax benefit of $73 million or $0.05 per share comprised of $179 million or $0.14 per share tax benefit due to a favorable audit settlement of the Company’s 2000-2002 U.S. tax returns and $106 million or $0.09 per share of incremental tax expense resulting from the decision to repatriate certain foreign earnings under the Homeland Investment Act (HIA). In addition, 2005 included impairment and other charges (credits), net of $28 million pretax income ($12 million after tax or $0.01 per share). In 2004, net income and diluted net income per common share were $2.3 billion and $1.79 and income from continuing operations was also $2.3 billion or $1.79 per share. The 2004 income from continuing operations included pretax operating charges of $151 million ($99 million after tax or $0.08 per share) related to a lease accounting correction and $130 million ($116 million after tax or $0.09 per share) related to impairment charges. Results also included pretax nonoperating income of $49 million ($49 million after tax or $0.04 per share) relating to the sale of the Company’s interest in a U.S. real estate partnership that resulted in the utilization of certain previously unrealized capital loss carryforwards. Refer to the Impairment and other charges (credits), net and Discontinued operations sections for further discussion. In 2006, diluted weighted-average shares outstanding decreased primarily due to treasury stock acquisitions exceeding stock option exercises in 2005 and 2006. The Company acquired 98.4 million shares, or $3.7 billion through both shares repurchased and shares accepted in connection with the Chipotle exchange, driving a reduction of about 5% of total shares outstanding compared with year–end 2005. For 2005, diluted weighted-average shares outstanding were relatively flat compared to 2004. Shares outstanding at the beginning of 2005 were higher than the prior year due to stock options exercised exceeding treasury stock purchased during 2004. Treasury stock purchased in 2005 offset this higher balance and the impact of options exercised during the year. Impact of foreign currency translation on reported results While changing foreign currencies affect reported results, McDonald’s mitigates exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows, and purchasing goods and services in local currencies. In 2006, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated revenues, operating income and net income primarily due to the stronger Euro, Canadian Dollar and British Pound. Consolidated revenues were positively impacted by the stronger Brazilian Real. In 2005, revenues were positively impacted by the Brazilian Real and the Canadian Dollar, but operating income and net income were minimally impacted by foreign currency translation. In 2004, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated revenues, operating income and net income due to the strengthening of several major currencies, primarily the Euro.

In the U.S., the increase in revenues in 2006 was primarily driven by our popular breakfast menu featuring Premium Roast Coffee, new products like our Asian Salad and Snack Wrap, and a wide variety of premium chicken options, as well as continued focus on everyday value and convenience. In 2005, the increase in revenues was driven by multiple initiatives that delivered variety like the introduction of Premium Chicken Sandwiches, convenience such as cashless payment options and extended hours as well as our focus on value. Europe’s constant currency increase in revenues in 2006 was primarily due to strong comparable sales in France, Germany and Russia (which is entirely Company-operated). In addition, revenues in 2006 benefited from positive comparable sales in the U.K., which were offset by the impact of the market’s Company-operated restaurant closings and sales to franchisees and affiliates throughout the year. In 2005, the increase in revenues was due to strong comparable sales in Russia and positive comparable sales in France and Germany, partly offset by negative comparable sales in the U.K. In APMEA, the constant currency increase in revenues in 2006 was primarily driven by the consolidation of Malaysia for financial reporting purposes due to an increase in the Company’s ownership during the first quarter 2006, expansion and positive comparable sales in China, as well as positive comparable sales in most markets. The increase was partly offset by the 2005 conversion of the Philippines and Turkey (about 325 restaurants) to developmental licensee structures. In 2005, revenues benefited from strong comparable sales in Australia and Taiwan, and were negatively impacted by the Philippines and Turkey as mentioned above. In addition, revenues in 2005 benefited from expansion in China, partly offset by that market’s negative comparable sales. 16 Table of Contents The following tables present Systemwide sales growth rates and the increase in comparable sales for McDonald’s restaurants: Systemwide sales–McDonald’s restaurants Increase Increaseexcluding currencytranslation 2006 2005 2006 2005 U.S. 6 % 5 % 6 % 5 % Europe 8 4 7 4 APMEA 5 6 8 6 Latin America 21 21 16 13 Canada 12 8 5 1 Total 7 % 6 % 7 % 5 % Comparable sales–McDonald’s restaurants Increase 2006 2005 2004 U.S. 5.2 % 4.4 % 9.6 % Europe 5.8 2.6 2.4 APMEA 5.5 4.0 5.6 Latin America 14.6 11.6 13.0 Canada 4.7 0.3 5.4 Total 5.7 % 3.9 % 6.9 % Operating margins Operating margin information and discussions relate to McDonald’s restaurants only and exclude non-McDonald’s brands. • Franchised margins Franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants less the Company’s occupancy costs (rent and depreciation) associated with those sites. Franchised margin dollars represented about 65% of the combined operating margins in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Franchised margin dollars increased $357 million or 9% (8% in constant currencies) in 2006 and $246 million or 6% as reported and in constant currencies in 2005. The U.S. and Europe segments accounted for more than 85% of the franchised margin dollars in all three years.

Company-operated margin dollars increased $398 million or 19% (17% in constant currencies) in 2006 and increased $96 million or 5% (4% in constant currencies) in 2005.

In 2005, the Company-operated margin percent benefited from positive comparable sales, more than offset by higher commodity, labor and occupancy costs. Europe’s Company-operated margin percent increased in 2006 primarily due to strong comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor costs throughout the segment. In addition, initiatives in the U.K. such as the closing of certain underperforming restaurants in the first quarter and the sales of Company-operated restaurants to franchisees and affiliates throughout the year, contributed to the increase. In 2005, the Company-operated margin percent decreased due to higher labor costs and negative comparable sales in the U.K., partly offset by strong performance in Russia. In addition, higher beef costs in 2005 had a negative impact across the segment. In APMEA, the Company-operated margin percent in 2006 reflected improving results in China and many other markets. In 2005, the Company-operated margin percent was negatively impacted by weak results in South Korea, partly offset by improvements in Hong Kong. • Supplemental information regarding Company-operated McDonald’s restaurants We continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance, profits and returns. In most cases, franchising is the best way to achieve these goals. Although direct 17 Table of Contents restaurant operation is significantly more capital-intensive relative to franchising and results in lower operating margins as a percent of revenues, Company-operated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets. In our Company-operated restaurants, we develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that we introduce Systemwide only those that we believe are most beneficial. In addition, we firmly believe that operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor. We report results for Company-operated restaurants based on their sales, less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs. We report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues, less associated occupancy costs. For this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure, we do not specifically allocate selling, general & administrative expenses and other operating (income) expenses to Company-operated or franchised restaurants. Other operating items that relate to the Company-operated restaurants generally include gains on sales of restaurant businesses and write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements. We believe the following information about Company-operated restaurants in our most significant markets will provide an additional perspective on this business. Management responsible for our Company-operated restaurants in these markets analyzes the Company-operated business on this basis to assess its performance. Management of the Company also considers this information when evaluating our restaurant ownership mix, subject to other relevant considerations. The tables below seek to illustrate the two components of our Company-operated margins. The first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations, which we refer to below as “Restaurant margin.” The second relates to the value of our Brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and service fees. We refer to this component as “Brand/real estate margin.” Both Company-operated and franchised restaurants are charged rent and service fees, although rent and service fees for Company-operated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation. Rent and service fees for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales, and the actual percentage attributable to rent varies depending on the level of McDonald’s investment in the restaurant. Service fees may also vary by market. As shown below, in disaggregating the components of our Company-operated margins, certain costs with respect to Company-operated restaurants would be reflected in Brand/real estate margin. Those costs consist of rent payable by McDonald’s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of Occupancy & other operating expenses recorded in the Consolidated statement of income. Restaurant margin would reflect rent and service fees paid, and those fees would be accounted for as income in calculating Brand/real estate margin. While we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our Company-operated business, it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or operating margins as reported by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In particular, as noted above, we do not allocate selling, general & administrative expenses to our Company-operated business. An estimate of costs to support this business was made by the U.S., Canada and our three major markets in Europe. We believe, on average, that a range of $40,000 to $50,000 per restaurant is typical, but the actual costs will vary by restaurant depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market. These costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant.

Selling, general & administrative expenses Consolidated selling, general & administrative expenses increased 8% in 2006 and 12% in 2005 (7% and 11% in constant currencies). In 2006, the increase was due to higher employee-related costs, including performance-based compensation expense. Share-based compensation expense due to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)) accounted for a majority of the constant currency increase in 2005.

Effective January 1, 2005, there was a reclassification of certain information technology expenses totaling approximately $22 million from the Corporate & Other segment to the U.S. segment. (2) On January 1, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R). This accounting standard requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Share-based compensation was included as a pro forma disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for years prior to the adoption. For 2004, pro forma share-based expense as reported in the Company’s year-end 2004 Form 10-K was $156 million after tax, of which $7 million of expense related to restricted stock units (RSUs) was included in net income. The remaining $149 million after tax ($241 million pretax) was disclosed in a note to the consolidated financial statements, as required, for pro forma purposes. The segments reflected the following pro forma share-based expense in 2004 (in millions): U.S.–$69; Europe–$49; APMEA–$22; Latin America–$9; Canada–$8; Corporate & Other–$84; Total–$241. The above pro forma increase/(decrease) is using an adjusted 2004 expense which is calculated by adding pro forma share-based expense to reported selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of revenues were 10.8% in 2006 compared with 10.9% in 2005 and 10.4% in 2004, and selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales were 4.1% in 2006 compared with 4.0% in 2005 and 3.8% in 2004. On a pro forma basis, share-based compensation expense would increase these ratios 1.3 and 0.5 percentage points, respectively, for 2004. Management believes that analyzing selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales, as well as revenues, is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support Systemwide restaurants. Impairment and other charges (credits), net On a pretax basis, the Company recorded impairment and other charges (credits), net of $134 million in 2006, ($28) million in 2005 and $281 million in 2004 associated with impairment, as well as certain strategic actions in 2006 and a lease accounting correction in 2004. McDonald’s management does not include these items when reviewing business performance trends because we do not believe these items are indicative of expected ongoing results.

In 2005, the Company recorded $23 million of pretax impairment charges primarily in South Korea. In addition, the Company recorded $51 million of pretax income, primarily due to the transfer of the Company’s ownership interest in Turkey to a developmental licensee and a favorable adjustment to certain liabilities established in prior years due to lower than originally anticipated employee-related and lease termination costs. In 2004, the Company recorded $130 million of pretax impairment charges primarily in South Korea. In addition, like other companies in the restaurant and retail industries, the Company reviewed its accounting practices and policies with respect to leasing transactions. Following this review and in consultation with its external auditors, the Company corrected an error in the amount of $151 million pretax in its prior practices to conform the lease term used in calculating straight-line rent expense with the term used to amortize improvements on leased property. The result of the correction primarily accelerated the recognition of rent expense under certain leases that include fixed-rent escalations by revising the computation of straight-line rent expense to include these escalations for certain option periods. As the correction related solely to accounting treatment, it did not affect McDonald’s historical or future cash flows or the timing of payments under the related leases. Its effect on the Company’s net income per share, cash provided by operations and shareholders’ equity was immaterial. These adjustments primarily impacted the U.S., China and Boston Market. Other markets were less significantly impacted, as many of the leases outside of the U.S. do not contain fixed-rent escalations.

The Company’s purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees and affiliates are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business. • Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates–businesses in which the Company actively participates but does not control–represents McDonald’s share of each affiliate’s results. These results are reported after interest expense and income taxes, except for partnerships in certain markets such as the U.S., which are reported before income taxes. Results in 2006 increased partly due to improved results from our Japanese affiliate. Results in 2005 decreased primarily due to results from our Japanese affiliate, which included a one-time adjustment for restaurant employees’ back pay. • Asset dispositions and other expense Asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for contingencies and uncollectible receivables, and other miscellaneous expenses. These amounts can vary significantly by year. In 2006, results included a gain of $26 million related to the sale of an office building in Russia and results for 2005 reflected a $24 million charge related to a supply chain arrangement in Europe. 20 Table of Contents Operating income Consolidated operating income in 2006 and 2005 included higher combined operating margin dollars, partly offset by higher selling, general & administrative expenses compared with the prior year.

The remaining $149 million after tax ($241 million pretax) was disclosed in a note to the consolidated financial statements, as required, for pro forma purposes. The segments reflected the following pro forma share-based expense in 2004 (in millions): U.S.–$69; Europe –$49; APMEA–$22; Latin America–$9; Canada–$8; Corporate & Other–$84; Total–$241. The above pro forma increase/(decrease) is using an adjusted 2004 expense which is calculated by subtracting pro forma share-based expense from reported operating income. When comparing 2005 to 2004, the following discussion of operating income relates to the pro forma increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation in the table above. In 2006 and 2005, U.S. operating income included higher combined operating margin dollars compared to 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2004, operating income included charges related to the lease accounting correction of $70 million, impairment charges of $10 million and higher asset dispositions compared to 2005. In Europe, results for 2006 reflected strong performance in France and a gain on the sale of an office building in Russia, partly offset by impairment and other charges. In addition, 2006 operating results in the U.K. and Germany contributed to the increase in operating income. In 2005, results reflected strong performance in France and Russia, improved performance in Germany and weak results in the U.K. In addition, results in 2005 included a supply chain charge of $24 million. In APMEA, results for 2006 were driven by strong performance in Australia as well as improved results in China and Japan, partly offset by impairment and other charges. Results for 2005 were positively impacted by strong performance in Australia, partly offset by weak results in Japan, China and South Korea. In addition, lower impairment and other charges in 2005 compared to 2004 benefited the growth rate. In Latin America, results for 2006 and 2005 reflected continued strong sales performance across most markets. In addition, 2006 results included $31 million of impairment and other charges, primarily due to the buy out of certain litigating franchisees in Brazil. In 2005, results reflected lower asset dispositions and other expense compared to 2004. Results for 2006 in the Corporate & Other segment reflected higher performance-based compensation, as well as costs related to our biennial worldwide operator convention. Results for 2006 and 2005 included favorable adjustments to certain liabilities established in prior years of $7 million and $26 million, respectively. In 2005, results benefited from lower share-based compensation, certain information technology expenses that are now reflected in the U.S. segment and lower performance-based compensation compared to 2004. Interest expense Interest expense for 2006 increased primarily due to higher average debt levels as a result of activity related to HIA, funded by local borrowings, in late 2005 and higher average interest rates. In late fourth quarter 2005, the Company repatriated approximately $3 billion of certain foreign historical earnings under HIA, which had a minimal impact on the average debt levels for 2005. Interest expense for 2005 reflected higher average interest rates and lower average debt levels compared with 2004. Nonoperating (income) expense, net Nonoperating (income) expense, net IN MILLIONS 2006 2005 2004 Interest income $ (152 ) $ (73 ) $ (28 ) Translation loss — 7 28 Gain on sale of U.S. real estate partnership (49 ) Other expense 29 28 28 Total $ (123 ) $ (38 ) $ (21 ) 21 Table of Contents Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on short-term cash investments. Translation losses primarily relate to the net gains or losses on certain hedges that reduce the exposure to variability on certain intercompany foreign cash flow streams. Other expense primarily consists of gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and minority interest. Interest income increases for 2006 and 2005 were primarily due to higher cash levels. Provision for income taxes In 2006, 2005 and 2004, the reported effective income tax rates were 31.0%, 29.6%, and 28.8%, respectively. The 2006 effective tax rate was negatively impacted by a tax law change in Canada. In 2005, the effective tax rate included a benefit of $179 million due to a favorable audit settlement of the Company’s 2000-2002 U.S. tax returns, partly offset by approximately $106 million of expense related to the Company’s decision to take advantage of the onetime opportunity provided under HIA. The effective income tax rate for 2004 benefited from an international transaction and the utilization of certain previously unrealized capital loss carryforwards. Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.1 billion in both 2006 and 2005. Substantially all of the net tax assets arose in the U.S. and other profitable markets. Discontinued operations In first quarter 2006, Chipotle completed an IPO of 6.1 million shares resulting in net proceeds of $121 million to Chipotle and a tax-free gain to McDonald’s of $32 million reflecting an increase in the carrying value of the Company’s investment as a result of Chipotle selling shares in the public offering. Concurrent with the IPO, McDonald’s sold 3.0 million Chipotle shares, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $61 million and an additional gain of $13 million after tax. In second quarter 2006, McDonald’s sold an additional 4.5 million Chipotle shares, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $268 million and a gain of $128 million after tax, while still retaining majority ownership. In October 2006, the Company completely separated from Chipotle through a tax-free exchange of its remaining Chipotle shares for McDonald’s common stock. McDonald’s accepted 18.6 million shares of its common stock in exchange for the 16.5 million shares of Chipotle class B common stock held by McDonald’s and recorded a tax-free gain of $480 million in the fourth quarter. As a result of the complete disposition of Chipotle, the Company has reflected Chipotle’s results of operations through the date of the exchange and transaction gains as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Accounting changes • SFAS Statement No. 123(R) Effective January 1, 2005, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) (SFAS No. 123(R)) using the modified-prospective transition method. Under this transition method, compensation cost in 2005 includes the portion vesting in the period for (1) all share-based payments granted prior to, but not vested as of January 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and (2) all share-based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Results for prior periods have not been restated. Refer to the Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this item. • SFAS Statement No. 158 In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132 (R) (SFAS No. 158). SFAS No. 158 requires the Company to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in the Consolidated balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year changes occur through other comprehensive income. The Company adopted the applicable provisions of SFAS No. 158 effective December 31, 2006, as required. This resulted in a net adjustment to other comprehensive income of $89 million, for a limited number of applicable international markets. • EITF Issue 06-2 In June 2006, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 06-2, Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43, Accounting for Compensated Absences (EITF 06-2). Under EITF 06-2, compensation costs associated with a sabbatical should be accrued over the requisite service period, assuming certain conditions are met. Previously, the Company expensed sabbatical costs as incurred. The Company adopted EITF 06-2 effective January 1, 2007, as required and accordingly, we expect to record a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings of approximately $35 million in the first quarter of 2007. We expect the annual impact to earnings to be insignificant. • FASB Interpretation No. 48 In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which is an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective January 1, 2007, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48 on our financial statements; however, we do not expect the impact to be significant. • SFAS Statement No. 157 In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company expects to adopt SFAS No. 157 effective January 1, 2008, as required. We cannot reasonably estimate the impact of adoption at this time. 22 Table of Contents CASH FLOWS The Company generates significant cash provided by operations and has substantial credit capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and debt repayments. Cash provided by operations totaled $4.3 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $2.6 billion in 2006, while cash provided by operations totaled $4.3 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $2.7 billion in 2005. In 2006, cash provided by operations was flat compared to 2005 due to increased operating results, offset by changes in working capital primarily due to higher 2006 income tax payments. In 2005, cash provided by operations increased $433 million compared to 2004 due to strong operating results, primarily in the U.S., and changes in working capital. The changes in working capital in 2005 benefited from lower income tax payments compared with the prior year. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.3 billion in 2006, a decrease of $544 million compared to 2005. The increase in capital expenditures was more than offset by the proceeds from the disposition of Chipotle as well as the sales of short-term investments. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.8 billion in 2005, an increase of $435 million compared with 2004 primarily due to higher capital expenditures and increased purchases of restaurant businesses. Cash used for financing activities totaled $5.2 billion in 2006 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $362 million in 2005. The 2006 activity was due to higher shares repurchased, higher net debt repayments and an increase in the common stock dividend. In 2005, cash provided by financing activities increased $2.0 billion primarily due to $2.9 billion of local borrowings related to HIA and higher proceeds from employee stock option exercises. The increase was partly offset by higher shares repurchased, higher debt repayments and an increase in the common stock dividend compared to 2004. As a result of the above activity, the Company’s cash and equivalents balance decreased $2.1 billion in 2006 to $2.1 billion, compared to an increase of $2.9 billion in 2005. In addition to cash and equivalents and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. Restaurant development and capital expenditures In 2006, the Company opened 643 traditional McDonald’s restaurants and 101 satellite restaurants (small, limited-menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 284 traditional restaurants and 180 satellite restaurants. In 2005, the Company opened 558 traditional McDonald’s restaurants and 120 satellite restaurants, and closed 145 traditional restaurants and 263 satellite restaurants. About 65% and 70% of McDonald’s restaurant openings occurred in the major markets in 2006 and 2005, respectively.

(2) Represents Boston Market restaurants. In 2007, the Company expects to open about 700 traditional McDonald’s restaurants and 100 satellite restaurants and close about 250 traditional restaurants and 150 satellite restaurants. Approximately 60% of Company-operated restaurants and about 85% of franchised and affiliated restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2006. Franchisees and affiliates operated about 75% of McDonald’s restaurants at year-end 2006. Boston Market restaurants are Company-operated. Capital expenditures increased $135 million or 8% in 2006 and $188 million or 13% in 2005. The increase in capital expenditures in both years was primarily due to increased investment in existing restaurants, primarily in the U.S. Capital expenditures in both years reflects the Company’s focus on growing sales at existing restaurants, including reinvestment initiatives such as reimaging in several markets around the world. Capital expenditures related to discontinued operations were $63 million, $84 million and $98 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, and primarily related to new Chipotle restaurants. Capital expenditures invested in major markets, excluding Japan, represented about 70% of the total in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts.

New restaurant investments in both 2006 and 2005 were concentrated in markets with acceptable returns and/or opportunities for long-term growth. Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies and leveraging best practices. In addition, foreign currency fluctuations affect average development costs. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs on every restaurant opened, in 2006, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonald’s restaurants averaged approximately $2.2 million in the U.S. and approximately 23 Table of Contents $1.9 million in the nine markets where development was concentrated outside the U.S. For 2007, the U.S., China and eight other consolidated markets are expected to open more than 500 restaurants. The Company owned approximately 45% of the land and nearly 70% of the buildings for its restaurants at year-end 2006 and 2005. Share repurchases and dividends In 2006, the Company returned nearly $5 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares acquired and dividends paid. In 2007 and 2008 combined, the Company expects to return at least an additional $5 billion to shareholders through a combination of additional share repurchases and dividends. Shares acquired and dividends IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA 2006 2005 2004 Number of shares acquired(1) 98.4 39.5 22.2 Dividends declared per share $ 1.00 $ .67 $ .55 Dollar amount of shares acquired(1) $ 3,719 $ 1,228 $ 605 Dividends 1,217 842 695 Total returned to shareholders $ 4,936 $ 2,070 $ 1,300 (1) Includes 18.6 million shares or $743.6 million acquired through the October 2006 Chipotle exchange. During 2006, the Company completed a $5.0 billion share repurchase program initially authorized by the Board of Directors in 2001. In March 2006, a new $5.0 billion program was authorized. Through 2006, approximately 36 million shares have been repurchased for $1.5 billion under this new program. The Company reduced its shares outstanding at year end by approximately 5% compared with 2005. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 31 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The Company has more than quadrupled the dividend from $0.235 per share in 2002 to $1.00 per share in 2006, totaling about $1.2 billion. This reflects the Company’s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividends will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors. FINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Total assets and returns Total assets decreased by $1.0 billion or 3% in 2006. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased total assets by approximately $1.3 billion in 2006, which was more than offset by a decrease in cash and the disposition of Chipotle. More than 65% of total assets were located in the consolidated major markets at year-end 2006. Net property and equipment increased $1.3 billion in 2006 and represented about 70% of total assets at year end. Total assets at December 31, 2005 included $2.9 billion of cash borrowed under HIA due to the repatriation of certain foreign earnings. Operating income, which excludes interest income, is used to compute return on average assets, while income from continuing operations is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. Assets of discontinued operations are excluded from the average assets since operating income excludes results from discontinued operations. Returns on assets and equity 2006 2005 2004 Return on average assets(1) 14.9 % 14.5 % 13.5 % Return on average common equity 18.5 17.7 17.8 (1) Return on average assets has been negatively impacted by significantly higher cash and equivalents balances due in part to the Company’s repatriation of certain earnings related to HIA in 2005. Cash and equivalents reduced return on average assets by 2.2 percentage points, 1.2 percentage points and 0.6 percentage points in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Impairment and other charges (credits), net reduced/(increased) return on average assets by 0.4 percentage points, (0.2) percentage points and 0.9 percentage points in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition, these items along with the 2005 net tax benefit due to a favorable audit settlement and incremental tax expense in connection with HIA and the 2004 nonoperating gain on the sale of a U.S. real estate partnership, reduced/(increased) return on average common equity by 0.6 percentage points, (0.6) percentage points and 1.3 percentage points in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2006 and 2005, return on average assets and return on average common equity both benefited from strong operating results in the U.S. In addition, returns in 2006 benefited from improved results in Europe. During 2007, the Company will continue to concentrate McDonald’s restaurant openings and new capital invested in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long-term growth. Financing and market risk The Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2006 totaled $8.4 billion, compared with $10.1 billion at December 31, 2005. The net decrease in 2006 was primarily due to net repayments ($2.3 billion) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133) noncash fair value adjustments ($82 million), partly offset by the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt ($605 million).

See Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements. (3) Includes the effect of interest rate and foreign currency exchange agreements. 24 Table of Contents (4) HIA-related borrowings caused an 18 percentage point decrease in fixed-rate debt in 2005. There was a slight increase in fixed-rate debt in 2006 as the Company began to repay a portion of the HIA-related borrowings. (5) HIA-related borrowings caused an 8 percentage point increase in foreign currency-denominated debt in 2005. Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch currently rate the Company’s commercial paper P-1, A-1 and F1, respectively; and its long-term debt A2, A and A, respectively. Historically, the Company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt. The Company’s key metrics for monitoring its credit structure are shown in the preceding table. While the Company targets these metrics for ease of focus, it also looks at similar credit ratios that incorporate capitalized operating leases to estimate total adjusted debt. Total adjusted debt is a term that is commonly used by the rating agencies referred to above, which includes debt outstanding on the Company’s balance sheet plus an adjustment to capitalize operating leases. Based on their most recent calculations, these agencies add between $7 billion and $11 billion of debt for lease capitalization purposes. The Company believes the rating agency methodology for capitalizing leases requires certain adjustments. These adjustments include: excluding percent rents in excess of minimum rents; excluding certain Company-operated restaurant lease agreements outside the U.S. that are cancelable with minimal penalties (representing approximately 25% of Company-operated restaurant minimum rents outside the U.S., based on the Company’s estimate); capitalizing non-restaurant leases using a multiple of three times rent expense; and reducing total rent expense by a percentage of the annual minimum rent payments due to the Company from franchisees operating on leased sites. Based on this calculation, for credit analysis purposes, approximately $4 billion to $5 billion of future operating lease payments would be capitalized. Certain of the Company’s debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company’s business. The Company has $1.3 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement (see Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements) as well as a U.S. shelf registration of debt securities and a Euro Medium-Term Notes program that each have approximately $2.9 billion of Company authority remaining for future debt issuances. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All exchange agreements are over-the-counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. All derivatives were recorded at fair value in the Company’s Consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2006 and 2005 primarily in miscellaneous other assets ($41 million and $83 million, respectively) and other long-term liabilities ($166 million and $103 million, respectively). See Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments for additional information regarding their use and the impact of SFAS No. 133 regarding derivatives. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. In 2006 and 2005, the Company used foreign currency debt to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated cash and equivalents related to HIA. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt, including the effects of foreign currency exchange agreements, was $6.8 billion and $8.1 billion for the years ended 2006 and 2005, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company was required to post collateral of $49 million and $24 million, respectively. The Company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Company’s largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures IN MILLIONS OF U.S. DOLLARS 2006 2005 Euro $ 2,758 $ 2,073 Canadian Dollars 1,099 1,070 Australian Dollars 837 682 British Pounds Sterling 770 822 Brazilian Reais 431 395 The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the U.S. Based on the results of these analyses of the Company’s financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2006 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2006 levels would materially affect the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. 25 Table of Contents Contractual obligations and commitments The Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2006. (See discussions of Cash flows and Financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.)

Debt obligations do not include $109 million of SFAS No. 133 noncash fair value adjustments. This effect is excluded because these adjustments ultimately have no impact on the obligation at maturity. The Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of Internal Revenue Service limitations. The investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market-rate investment alternatives under the Company’s qualified Profit Sharing and Savings Plan. Total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $379 million at December 31, 2006 and $366 million at December 31, 2005 and were included in other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet. In addition to long-term obligations, the Company had guaranteed certain affiliate and other loans totaling $12 million at December 31, 2006. OTHER MATTERS Critical accounting policies and estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions. The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity: • Property and equipment Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods. • Share-based compensation The Company has share-based compensation plans which authorize the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and RSUs to employees and non employee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and amortized over their vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions such as the expected life of the stock option and expected volatility of the Company’s stock over the expected life, which significantly impact the assumed fair value. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. • Long-lived assets impairment review Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Company’s long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Company’s experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. The biggest assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. 26 Table of Contents • Litigation accruals From time to time, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. • Income taxes The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. During 2005, the Company recorded a $179 million benefit due to favorable audit settlement of the Company’s 2000–2002 U.S. tax returns. The Company’s 2003-2004 U.S. tax returns are under audit and are expected to be settled in 2007. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for basis differences totaling $5 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. The basis differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If management’s intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. Effects of changing prices - inflation The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. Reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Company’s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization, from the base period. The denominator is the weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one- or three-year period. Adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities adjusted for cash generated from (used for) investing activities related to Chipotle. The weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter’s investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2006 cash used for investing activities is weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2006 cash used for investing activities is included in the one-year and three-year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2005 cash used for investing activities is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full year impact on 2006 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2005 cash used for investing activities is included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average. 27 Table of Contents The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one-year and three-year ROIIC are as follows: One-year ROIIC calculation Years ended December 31, 2006 2005 Incrementalchange NUMERATOR: Operating income $4,445.1 $3,992.5 $ 452.6 Depreciation and amortization(1) 1,224.9 1,220.3 4.6 Currency translation(2) (41.2 ) Incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates) $ 416.0 DENOMINATOR: Weighted–average adjusted cash used for investing activities(3) $1,661.4 Currency translation(2) 12.6 Weighted–average adjusted cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates) $1,674.0 One-year ROIIC(4) 24.9 % (1) Represents depreciation and amortization from continuing operations.

63908,MCD,MCDONALDS CORP,2008,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Description of the business The Company primarily franchises and operates McDonald’s restaurants. Of the 31,377 restaurants in 118 countries at year-end 2007, 20,505 are operated by franchisees (including 2,781 operated by developmental licensees), 3,966 are operated by affiliates and 6,906 are operated by the Company. Under our conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the required capital by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and décor of their restaurant businesses, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This ensures long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and improves alignment with franchisees. Under our developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, while the Company generally has no capital invested. We view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and continually review our restaurant ownership mix (that is, our mix among Company-operated, franchised, conventional or developmental license, and affiliated) to deliver a great customer experience and drive profitability. In most cases, franchising is the best way to achieve both goals. Although direct restaurant operation is more capital-intensive relative to franchising and results in lower restaurant margins as a percent of revenues, Company-operated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets. In our Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with our franchisees, we further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced Systemwide. In addition, we firmly believe that owning restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and essential to providing Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. Our Company-operated business also helps to facilitate changes in restaurant ownership as warranted by strategic considerations. Revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates. These fees primarily include rent and/or royalties that are based on a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments, along with initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. The business is managed as distinct geographic segments. Significant reportable segments include the United States (U.S.), Europe, and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA). In addition, throughout this report we present “Other Countries & Corporate” that includes operations in Canada and Latin America, as well as Corporate activities and certain investments. The U.S., Europe and APMEA segments account for 35%, 39% and 16% of total revenues, respectively. France, Germany and the United Kingdom (U.K.), collectively, account for approximately 60% of Europe’s revenues; and Australia, China and Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), collectively, account for over 50% of APMEA’s revenues. These six markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as “major markets” throughout this report and comprise over 70% of total revenues. The Company continues to focus its management and financial resources on the McDonald’s restaurant business as we believe the opportunities for long-term growth remain significant. Accordingly, during the third quarter 2007, the Company sold its investment in Boston Market. In 2006, the Company disposed of its investment in Chipotle Mexican Grill (Chipotle) via public stock offerings and a tax-free exchange for McDonald’s common stock. As a result of the disposals during 2007 and 2006, both Boston Market’s and Chipotle’s results of operations and transaction gains have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. In analyzing business trends, management considers a variety of performance and financial measures including comparable sales growth, Systemwide sales growth, restaurant margins and returns. • Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain compensation plans on these results because we believe they better represent the underlying business trends. • Comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the Company’s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include road construction, reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, and natural disasters. McDonald’s reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays, weekend days and timing of holidays in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales. The Company refers to this impact as the calendar shift/trading day adjustment. This impact varies geographically due to consumer spending patterns and has the greatest impact on monthly comparable sales. Typically, the annual impact is minimal, with the exception of leap years. • Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company, by franchisees or by affiliates. While sales by franchisees and affiliates are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company’s financial performance because it is the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised and affiliated revenues and is indicative of the financial health of our franchisee base. 11 Table of Contents • Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the adjusted cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation assumes a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. Strategic direction and financial performance The unique business relationship among the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the System) has been key to McDonald’s success over the years. This business model enables McDonald’s to play an integral role in the communities we serve and consistently deliver relevant restaurant experiences to customers. In addition, it facilitates our ability to implement innovative ideas and profitably grow our business worldwide. Since implementing the customer-centered Plan to Win several years ago, our focus has been on being better, not just bigger. Our strategic alignment behind this plan has created better McDonald’s experiences through the execution of multiple initiatives surrounding the five factors of exceptional customer experiences — people, products, place, price and promotion. While our focus has remained the same, we have adapted and evolved our initiatives based on the changing needs and preferences of our customers. These multiple initiatives have increased our consumer relevance and contributed to sales and guest counts worldwide increasing every year since 2003. As a result, we have met or exceeded our long-term financial targets, excluding the 2007 impact of the sale of 18 Latin American and Caribbean markets to a developmental licensee. These targets, which exclude the impact of foreign currency translation, include average annual Systemwide sales and revenue growth of 3% to 5%; average annual operating income growth of 6% to 7%; and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens. We believe our financial targets are realistic and sustainable and enable our management to focus on those opportunities that best optimize long-term shareholder value. In 2007, we built on our strong performance by focusing on what consumer insights indicate are key drivers of our global business today — convenience, branded affordability, daypart expansion and menu choice. Leveraging our ability to replicate and scale success in these areas worldwide, we drove global comparable sales up 6.8% and extended the number of consecutive monthly increases to 56 through December 2007. In the U.S., our momentum continued as we further built on our market-leading breakfast business; introduced new products such as the Southwest Salad, Cinnamon Melts and the McSkillet Burrito; extended our Snack Wrap line and offered greater beverage choices including Premium Roast iced coffee and sweet tea. These initiatives, along with longer operating hours and everyday value, resonated with consumers to drive increased customer visits and increased sales. In addition, our efforts to strengthen employee engagement and optimize efficiency in the drive-thru and at breakfast helped us to better serve even more customers. In Europe, we sustained strong sales growth in virtually every country. Primary contributors to this performance included France, Germany, Russia and the U.K. Our success in Europe was driven by continued execution along three key priorities: upgrading the customer and employee experience, building brand transparency, and enhancing local relevance. Key initiatives included reimaging more than 600 locations, actively communicating McDonald’s food quality, nutrition and employment facts and implementing a new kitchen operating system, which is now in over half of our European restaurants, to enhance operational efficiency and support greater menu variety. In addition, we satisfied consumer desire for choice and value with locally-relevant menus that feature a blend of premium sandwiches and salads, classic menu favorites, new products, limited-time food promotions as well as everyday value offerings. In APMEA, our business posted strong sales performance, driven by positive comparable sales in nearly every country, led by Japan, Australia and China. In addition, restaurant expansion in China — where we believe our growth potential is significant — contributed to revenue and operating income growth. Throughout APMEA, we enhanced our convenience by increasing the number of restaurants offering 24-hours or extended hours of service to approximately 4,500. We also continued to deliver value to customers through branded affordability platforms and offer menu choice and variety with locally-relevant core menu extensions such as the Teriyaki Mac in Japan and variations of the Filet-O-Fish in China. In addition, we invigorated our breakfast business in APMEA with the national launch of breakfast in China and the introduction of McGriddles sandwiches in Japan. Strong global performance generated $4.9 billion of cash from operations in 2007. About $1.9 billion of this cash was invested in our business primarily to reimage existing restaurants and build new ones. For 2007 through 2009, the Company expects to return $15 billion to $17 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, subject to business and market conditions. In 2007, we increased our annual dividend 50% to $1.50 per share — more than six times higher than the amount paid in 2002 — and repurchased over 77 million shares for $3.9 billion. In 2007, we took a number of steps to strengthen management’s focus on the core McDonald’s business and those markets that have the largest impact on results. We sold our investment in Boston Market in 2007, receiving proceeds of approximately $250 million. In addition, the Company retained about 50 sites, the majority of which will be converted to McDonald’s restaurants. We also made significant progress enhancing the mix of franchised and Company-operated restaurants, including executing our developmental license strategy, to maximize long-term brand performance and returns. Under a developmental license, a local entrepreneur owns the business, including controlling the real estate, and uses his/her capital and local knowledge to build the McDonald’s Brand and optimize long-term sales and profitability. The Company collects a royalty, which varies by market, based on a percent of sales, but does not invest any capital for new restaurants or reinvestments. We have successfully used this structure for more than 15 years and had it in place in 59 countries at year-end 2007. In August 2007, we completed the transition of 1,571 restaurants in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Puerto Rico, 12 Table of Contents Venezuela and 13 other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to a developmental license structure. The Company refers to these markets as “Latam.” Based on approval by the Company’s Board of Directors on April 17, 2007, the Company concluded Latam was “held for sale” as of that date in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.7 billion in 2007, substantially all of which was noncash. The charge included $896 million for the difference between the net book value of the Latam business and approximately $675 million in cash proceeds received. This loss in value was primarily due to a historically difficult economic environment coupled with volatility experienced in many of the markets included in this transaction. The charges also included historical foreign currency translation losses of $769 million recorded in shareholders’ equity. The Company recorded a tax benefit of $62 million in connection with this transaction. As a result of meeting the “held for sale” criteria, the Company ceased recording depreciation expense with respect to Latam effective April 17, 2007. In connection with the sale, the Company has agreed to indemnify the buyers for certain tax and other claims, certain of which are reflected as liabilities in McDonald’s Consolidated balance sheet totaling $179 million at year-end 2007. The buyers of the Company’s operations in Latam have entered into a 20-year master franchise agreement that requires the buyers, among other obligations to (i) pay monthly royalties commencing at a rate of approximately 5% of gross sales of the restaurants in these markets, substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements; (ii) commit to adding approximately 150 new McDonald’s restaurants over the first three years and pay an initial fee for each new restaurant opened; and (iii) commit to specified annual capital expenditures for existing restaurants. In addition, we transitioned another five small markets in Europe with a total of 24 restaurants to the developmental license structure in 2007. We also made progress franchising certain Company-operated restaurants in key markets. As a result of our developmental license strategy and franchising initiatives, the percent of franchised and affiliated restaurants worldwide increased from 74% at year-end 2006 to 78% at year-end 2007. Highlights from the year included: • Comparable sales increased 6.8% building on a 5.7% increase in 2006. • Systemwide sales increased 12% (8% in constant currencies). • Company-operated margins reached an eight-year high of 17.3%. Franchised margins were 81.5%—a level not achieved in over ten years. • Cash provided by operations totaled $4.9 billion and capital expenditures totaled $1.9 billion. • The Company announced that for 2007 through 2009, we expect to return $15 billion to $17 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, subject to business and market conditions. In 2007, the Company raised its annual dividend by 50% to $1.50 per share, or $1.8 billion, and repurchased 77.1 million shares for $3.9 billion, driving a reduction of over 3% of total shares outstanding at year end compared with 2006. • One-year ROIIC was 49.9% and three-year ROIIC was 39.4% for 2007. Outlook for 2008 The McDonald’s System is energized by our current worldwide momentum. We intend to build on this momentum by continuing to execute our Plan to Win with its strategic focus on our customers and restaurants while exercising disciplined financial management. As we do so, we are confident we will continue to meet or exceed the long-term financial targets previously discussed. We will continue to drive success in 2008 and beyond by leveraging key consumer insights and our global experience, while relying on our strengths in developing, testing and implementing initiatives surrounding our global business drivers of convenience, branded affordability, daypart expansion and menu variety. In the U.S., our key areas of focus will be breakfast, chicken, beverages and convenience. In 2008, we expect to build on our breakfast momentum and at the same time extend our leadership in the chicken category with the launch of the Southern Style Chicken Biscuit Sandwich for breakfast and the Southern Style Chicken Sandwich for the remainder of the day. We will also continue to provide value and convenience to solidify our connection with consumer lifestyles. In addition, as part of a comprehensive, multi-year beverage business strategy designed to take advantage of the significant and growing beverage category, we will begin introducing hot specialty coffee offerings in 2008, on a market-by-market basis. It will not be until late 2009 when we will begin to recognize the full sales benefit of our beverage opportunity. This first component of our beverage business may require construction, new equipment, new processes and training in our restaurants; all of which will serve as a platform for the anticipated future introduction of smoothies, frappes and other beverage options. In Europe, we plan to strengthen our local relevance using a tiered menu approach featuring premium selections, classic menu favorites and everyday affordable offerings. We will complement these with new products and limited-time food promotions developed in our European food studio. Building greater brand transparency will remain a priority in Europe, especially in the U.K., with ongoing communication efforts highlighting the quality of our food and building our reputation as an employer of choice. We will also create stronger bonds of trust by being accessible and maintaining an open dialogue with customers and key stakeholders. As part of our efforts to upgrade the customer experience, we will continue remodeling additional restaurants in the U.K. and Germany. In Germany, an integral part of our reimaging program includes adding about 100 McCafes in 2008. We will also continue installing our new kitchen operating system to ensure that we can consistently deliver high food quality, with a goal for this new system to be in virtually all of our European restaurants by the end of 2009. In APMEA, locally-relevant execution of our strategies surrounding convenience, breakfast, core menu extensions and value is essential to sustaining momentum in this diverse and dynamic part of the world. Convenience initiatives include leveraging the success of 24-hours or extended hours of service, offering delivery service in certain countries and building our drive-thru business, particularly in China. In addition, we will continue to emphasize breakfast to further build this daypart, communicate our everyday value offerings and feature limited-time variations of classic menu favorites. 13 Table of Contents We believe locally-owned and operated restaurants are at the core of our competitive advantage and make us not just a global brand but a locally relevant one. To that end, we continually evaluate ownership structures in our markets to maximize brand performance and further enhance the reliability of our cash flow and returns. We completed a detailed analysis of the appropriate ownership mix in key markets around the world taking into account our plans for each of those markets, the risks associated with operating in the market and restaurant-level results. This analysis also considered the current legal and regulatory environment which, in some countries such as China and Russia, may make it prudent for the Company to own and operate the restaurants. Based on this analysis, we expect to refranchise a total of 1,000 to 1,500 existing Company-operated restaurants, primarily in our major markets, over the next three or more years. This will be dependent on our ability to identify the appropriate prospective franchisees with the experience and financial resources in the relevant markets. In addition, we will continue to evaluate several small markets in APMEA and Europe for potential transition to developmental license structures. We will only convert such markets when we believe that we have identified a qualified licensee and our business is ready for transition to optimize the transaction for the long term. Our evolution toward a more heavily franchised, less capital-intensive business model has favorable implications for the amount of capital we invest, the strength and stability of our cash flow and for our returns. As a result, we expect free cash flow — cash from operations less capital expenditures — will continue to grow and be a significant source of cash used to fund our total cash returned to shareholders target for 2007 through 2009 of $15 billion to $17 billion. In addition, we expect our share repurchase activity will continue to yield reductions in the share count in the years ahead. While the Company does not provide specific guidance on net income per share, the following information is provided to assist in analyzing the Company’s results: • Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add slightly more than 1 percentage point to 2008 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies), most of which will be due to the 503 net traditional restaurants added in 2007. • The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point increase in U.S. comparable sales would increase annual net income per share by about 2.5 cents. Similarly, an increase of 1 percentage point in Europe’s comparable sales would increase annual net income per share by about 2.5 cents. • In 2008, U.S. beef costs are expected to be relatively flat and chicken costs are expected to rise about 4% to 5%. In Europe, beef costs are expected to be relatively flat in 2008, while chicken costs are expected to increase approximately 6% to 8%. Some volatility may be experienced between quarters in the normal course of business. • The Company expects full-year 2008 selling, general & administrative expenses to decline, in constant currencies, although fluctuations may be experienced between the quarters due to items such as the 2008 biennial worldwide owner/operator convention, the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics and the August 2007 sale of the Company’s businesses in Latam. • Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense in 2008 to increase approximately 15% to 20% compared with 2007, while 2008 interest income is expected to be about half of 2007 interest income. • A significant part of the Company’s operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 65% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro and the British Pound. If the Euro and the British Pound both move 10% in the same direction compared with 2007, the Company’s annual net income per share would change by about 8 cents to 9 cents. • The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2008 to be approximately 30% to 32%, although some volatility may be experienced between the quarters in the normal course of business. • The Company expects capital expenditures for 2008 to be approximately $2 billion. About half of this amount will be reinvested in existing restaurants while the rest will primarily be used to open 1,000 restaurants (950 traditional and 50 satellites). We expect net additions of about 600 (700 net traditional additions and 100 net satellite closings). • For 2007 through 2009, the Company expects to return $15 billion to $17 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, subject to business and market conditions. In 2007, the Company returned $5.7 billion of this goal to shareholders. • As a result of the new developmental licensee structure, the Company’s operating results in Latin America will reflect royalty income of approximately 5% of sales and minimal selling, general & administrative expenses to support the business. • We continually review our restaurant ownership structures to maximize cash flow and returns and to enhance local relevance. We expect to optimize our restaurant ownership mix by refranchising 1,000 to 1,500 Company-operated restaurants over the next three or more years, primarily in our major markets, and by continuing to execute our developmental license strategy. • In February 2008, a European private equity firm agreed to acquire U.K.-based Pret a Manger. As part of that transaction and consistent with its focus on the McDonald’s restaurant business, McDonald’s has agreed to sell its minority interest in Pret a Manger. The Company expects to recognize a nonoperating gain upon the closing of the transaction in late first quarter or early second quarter of 2008, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. 14 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS Operating results DOLLARS IN MILLIONS,EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA 2007 2006 2005 Amount Increase/ (decrease) Amount Increase/ (decrease) Amount Revenues Sales by Company-operated restaurants $ 16,611 8 % $ 15,402 10 % $ 14,018 Revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants 6,176 12 5,493 8 5,099 Total revenues 22,787 9 20,895 9 19,117 Operating costs and expenses Company-operated restaurant expenses 13,742 6 12,905 8 11,919 Franchised restaurants–occupancy expenses 1,140 8 1,058 4 1,021 Selling, general & administrative expenses 2,367 3 2,296 8 2,118 Impairment and other charges (credits), net 1,670 nm 134 nm (28 ) Other operating (income) expense, net (11 ) nm 69 (33 ) 103 Total operating costs and expenses 18,908 15 16,462 9 15,133 Operating income 3,879 (12 ) 4,433 11 3,984 Interest expense 410 2 402 13 356 Nonoperating income, net (103 ) (16 ) (123 ) nm (32 ) Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes 3,572 (14 ) 4,154 13 3,660 Provision for income taxes 1,237 (4 ) 1,288 19 1,082 Income from continuing operations 2,335 (19 ) 2,866 11 2,578 Income from discontinued operations (net of taxes of $35, $102 and $17) 60 nm 678 nm 24 Net income $ 2,395 (32 )% $ 3,544 36 % $ 2,602 Income per common share–diluted Continuing operations $ 1.93 (16 )% $ 2.29 13 % $ 2.02 Discontinued operations 0.05 nm 0.54 nm 0.02 Net income $ 1.98 (30 )% $ 2.83 39 % $ 2.04 Weighted-average common shares outstanding–diluted 1,211.8 1,251.7 1,274.2 nm Not meaningful. In addition to the consolidated operating results shown above, consolidated results for 2007 are presented in the following table, excluding the impact of the Latam developmental license transaction. While the Company has previously converted certain other markets to a developmental license structure, management believes the Latam transaction and the associated charge are not indicative of ongoing operations due to the size and scope of the transaction. Management believes that the adjusted operating results better reflect the underlying business trends relevant to the periods presented. 15 Table of Contents The following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 to the operating results excluding the impact of the Latam transaction, compared to 2006 results.

The tax benefit of $62 million was minimal due to the Company’s inability to utilize most of the capital losses generated by this transaction. ** The results for the full year 2006 included impairment and other charges of $134 million of operating expenses primarily related to strategic actions taken to enhance overall profitability and improve returns. *** The following items positively impacted the growth in diluted income per share from continuing operations and diluted income per share by 15 percentage points and 12 percentage points, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with 2006: 2007 • $0.26 per share of income tax benefit resulting from the completion of the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) examination of the Company’s 2003-2004 U.S. federal income tax returns; partly offset by • $0.02 per share of income tax expense related to the impact of a tax law change in Canada. 2006 • $0.08 per share of operating expenses primarily related to strategic actions taken to enhance overall profitability and improve returns; and • $0.01 per share of net incremental income tax expense primarily related to the impact of a tax law change in Canada. Net income and diluted net income per common share In 2007, net income and diluted net income per common share were $2.4 billion and $1.98. Income from continuing operations was $2.3 billion or $1.93 per share, which included $1.6 billion or $1.30 per share of net expense related to the Latam transaction. This reflects an impairment charge of $1.32 per share, partly offset by a $0.02 per share benefit due to eliminating depreciation on the assets in Latam in mid-April 2007 in accordance with accounting rules. In addition, 2007 results included a net tax benefit of $288 million or $0.24 per share resulting from the completion of an IRS examination of the Company’s 2003-2004 U.S. federal income tax returns, partly offset by the impact of a tax law change in Canada. Income from discontinued operations was $60 million or $0.05 per share. In 2006, net income and diluted net income per common share were $3.5 billion and $2.83. Income from continuing operations was $2.9 billion or $2.29 per share, which included $134 million ($98 million after tax or $0.08 per share) of impairment and other charges primarily related to strategic actions taken to enhance overall profitability and improve returns, as well as $0.01 per share of net incremental income tax expense primarily related to the impact of a tax law change in Canada. Income from discontinued operations was $678 million or $0.54 per share. In 2005, net income and diluted net income per common share were $2.6 billion and $2.04. Income from continuing operations was $2.6 billion or $2.02 per share, while income from discontinued operations was $24 million or $0.02 per share. The 2005 results from continuing operations included a net tax benefit of $73 million or $0.05 per share comprised of $179 million or $0.14 per share tax benefit resulting from the completion of an IRS examination of the Company’s 2000-2002 U.S. federal income tax returns, partly offset by $106 million or $0.09 per share of incremental tax expense resulting from the decision to repatriate certain foreign earnings under the Homeland Investment Act (HIA). In addition, 2005 results included impairment and other charges (credits), net of $28 million pretax income ($12 million after tax or $0.01 per share). Refer to the Impairment and other charges (credits), net and Discontinued operations sections for further discussion. In 2007, the Company repurchased 77.1 million shares for $3.9 billion, driving a reduction of over 3% of total shares outstanding compared with year-end 2006, after considering stock option exercises. In 2006, the Company acquired 98.4 million shares or $3.7 billion, through both shares repurchased and shares accepted in connection with the Chipotle exchange, driving a reduction of about 5% of total shares outstanding compared with year-end 2005, after considering stock option exercises. 16 Table of Contents Impact of foreign currency translation on reported results While changing foreign currencies affect reported results, McDonald’s mitigates exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows, and purchasing goods and services in local currencies. In 2007, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated revenues, operating income, net income and net income per share, primarily driven by the stronger Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. In 2006, consolidated revenues, operating income and net income were positively impacted by the stronger Euro, Canadian Dollar and British Pound. Consolidated revenues in 2006 were also positively impacted by the stronger Brazilian Real. In 2005, consolidated revenues were positively impacted by the Brazilian Real and the Canadian Dollar, but operating income and net income were minimally impacted by foreign currency translation.

New products introduced in 2007 included the Southwest Salad and an extended Snack Wrap line, while new products introduced in 2006 included Snack Wraps and the Asian Salad. Europe’s constant currency increase in revenues in 2007 was primarily due to strong comparable sales in France, Russia (which is entirely Company-operated), the U.K. and Germany, as well as positive comparable sales throughout the segment. In 2006, the increase in revenues was due to strong comparable sales in France, Germany and Russia. In addition, revenues in 2006 benefited from positive comparable sales in the U.K., which were partly offset by the impact of closing certain Company-operated restaurants. The increases for both 2007 and 2006 were partly offset by a higher proportion of franchised and affiliated restaurants compared with the prior year, primarily due to sales of Company-operated restaurants, in conjunction with our overall franchising strategy, specifically in the U.K. In APMEA, the constant currency increase in revenues in 2007 was primarily driven by strong comparable sales in China and Australia, as well as positive comparable sales in substantially all other markets. In addition, expansion in China contributed to the increase. In 2006, the increase in revenues was primarily driven by the consolidation of Malaysia for financial reporting purposes due to an increase in the Company’s ownership during the first quarter 2006, expansion and positive comparable sales in China, as well as positive comparable sales in most markets. The increase was partly offset by the 2005 conversion of the Philippines and Turkey (about 325 restaurants) to developmental license structures. In Other Countries & Corporate, Company-operated sales declined in 2007 while franchised and affiliated revenues increased as a result of the completion of the Latam transaction in August 2007.

Franchised margin dollars represented about 65% of the combined restaurant margins in 2007, 2006 and 2005. Franchised margin dollars increased $601 million or 14% (10% in constant currencies) in 2007 and $357 million or 9% (8% in constant currencies) in 2006. The U.S. and Europe segments accounted for about 85% of the franchised margin dollars in all three years.

The 2007 increase in franchised margin for Other Countries & Corporate is primarily due to the sale of Latam in August 2007. As a result of the sale, the Company receives royalties based on a percent of sales in these markets. • Company-operated margins Company-operated margin dollars represent sales by Company-operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. Company-operated margin dollars increased $372 million or 15% (10% in constant currencies) in 2007 and increased $398 million or 19% (17% in constant currencies) in 2006.

In 2006, the Company-operated margin percent increased due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor costs, commodity costs and utilities. Europe’s Company-operated margin percent increased in 2007 primarily due to strong comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor and commodity costs. In 2006, the Company-operated margin percent increased due to strong comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor costs. In addition, initiatives in the U.K., such as the closing of certain underperforming restaurants in the first quarter 2006 and the sales of Company-operated restaurants to franchisees and affiliates, contributed to the increases in 2006, and to a lesser extent, 2007. In APMEA, the Company-operated margin percent in 2007 increased due to strong comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor costs. In both years, the Company-operated margin percent reflected improved results in China and many other markets. In Other Countries & Corporate, the Company-operated margin in 2007 reflected Latam operations through July 2007 and the benefit due to the discontinuation of depreciation on the assets in Latam from mid-April through July 2007. • Supplemental information regarding Company-operated restaurants We continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance, profits and returns. In most cases, franchising is the best way to achieve these goals. Although direct restaurant operation is significantly more capital-intensive relative to franchising and results in lower restaurant margins as a percent of revenues, Company-operated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets. In our Company-operated restaurants, we further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced Systemwide. In addition, we firmly believe that operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and essential to providing Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. We report results for Company-operated restaurants based on their sales, less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs. We report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues, less associated occupancy costs. For this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure, we do not specifically allocate selling, general & administrative expenses and other operating (income) expenses to Company-operated or franchised restaurants. Other operating items that relate to the Company-operated restaurants generally include gains on sales of restaurant businesses and write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements. We believe the following information about Company-operated restaurants in our most significant markets provides an additional perspective on this business. Management responsible for our Company-operated restaurants in these markets analyzes the Company-operated business on this basis to assess its performance. Management of the Company also considers this information when evaluating our restaurant ownership mix, subject to other relevant considerations. The following tables seek to illustrate the two components of our Company-operated margins. The first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations, which we refer to below as “Store operating margin.” The second relates to the value of our Brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties. We refer to this component as “Brand/real estate margin.” Both Company-operated and franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties, although rent and royalties for Company-operated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation. Rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales, and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of McDonald’s investment in the restaurant. Royalties may also vary by market. As shown in the following tables, in disaggregating the components of our Company-operated margins, certain costs with respect to Company-operated restaurants are reflected in Brand/real estate margin. Those costs consist of rent payable by McDonald’s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy & other operating expenses recorded in the Consolidated statement of income. Store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses, and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating Brand/real estate margin. While we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our Company-operated business, it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In particular, as noted above, we do not allocate selling, general & administrative expenses to our Company-operated business. An estimate of costs to support this business was made by the U.S. and our three major markets in Europe. We believe, on average, that a range of $40,000 to $50,000 per restaurant is typical, but the actual costs will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market. These costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant. 19 Table of Contents U.S. Europe DOLLARS IN MILLIONS 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 As reported Number of Company-operated restaurants at year end 2,090 2,104 2,097 2,177 2,253 2,382 Sales by Company-operated restaurants $ 4,682 $ 4,410 $ 4,098 $ 6,817 $ 5,885 $ 5,465 Company-operated margin $ 876 $ 843 $ 768 $ 1,205 $ 960 $ 817 Store operating margin Company-operated margin $ 876 $ 843 $ 768 $ 1,205 $ 960 $ 817 Plus: Outside rent expense (1) 82 82 79 248 229 225 Depreciation – buildings & leasehold improvements(1) 78 74 68 107 98 97 Less: Rent & royalties(2) (691 ) (651 ) (605 ) (1,294 ) (1,099 ) (1,048 ) Store operating margin $ 345 $ 348 $ 310 $ 266 $ 188 $ 91 Brand/real estate margin Rent & royalties(2) $ 691 $ 651 $ 605 $ 1,294 $ 1,099 $ 1,048 Less: Outside rent expense (1) (82 ) (82 ) (79 ) (248 ) (229 ) (225 ) Depreciation – buildings & leasehold improvements(1) (78 ) (74 ) (68 ) (107 ) (98 ) (97 ) Brand/real estate margin $ 531 $ 495 $ 458 $ 939 $ 772 $ 726 (1) Represents certain costs recorded as occupancy & other operating expenses in the Consolidated statement of income – rent payable by McDonald’s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements.

Selling, general & administrative expenses Consolidated selling, general & administrative expenses increased 3% (flat in constant currencies) in 2007 and 8% (7% in constant currencies) in 2006. In 2007, higher employee-related costs were offset by a reduction in costs due to the Latam transaction. In 2006, the increase was due to higher employee-related costs, including performance-based compensation expense.

In addition, the Company recorded a $16 million write-off of assets associated with the Toasted Deli Sandwich products in Canada and a net gain of $14 million as a result of the transfer of the Company’s ownership interest in three European markets to a developmental licensee, partly offset by a loss on the anticipated transfer of a small market in Europe to a developmental licensee. In 2006, the Company recorded $134 million of pretax impairment charges primarily related to the following items: losses incurred on the transfers of the Company’s ownership interest in certain markets to developmental licensees ($36 million); the closing of certain restaurants in the U.K. in conjunction with an overall restaurant portfolio review ($35 million); costs to buy out certain litigating franchisees in Brazil ($29 million); asset write-offs and other charges in APMEA ($18 million); and a loss related to the decision to dispose of supply chain operations in Russia ($13 million). In 2005, the Company recorded $23 million of pretax impairment charges primarily in South Korea. In addition, the Company recorded $51 million of pretax income, primarily due to the transfer of the Company’s ownership interest in Turkey to a developmental licensee and a favorable adjustment to certain liabilities established in prior years due to lower than originally anticipated employee-related and lease termination costs.

The Company’s purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees and affiliates are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business. The Company realized higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses in 2007 primarily as a result of selling more Company-operated restaurants in connection with our refranchising strategy in the Company’s major markets. • Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates–businesses in which the Company actively participates but does not control–represents McDonald’s share of each affiliate’s results. These results are reported after interest expense and income taxes, except for partnerships in certain markets such as the U.S., which are reported before income taxes. Results in 2007 and 2006 increased partly due to improved results from our Japanese affiliate. • Asset dispositions and other expense Asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for contingencies and uncollectible receivables, and other miscellaneous expenses. In 2006, results included a gain of $26 million related to the sale of an office building in Russia and results for 2005 reflected a $24 million charge related to a supply chain arrangement in Europe. 21 Table of Contents Operating income Operating income DOLLARS IN MILLIONS Amount Increase/ (decrease) Increase/ (decrease) excluding currency translation 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2007 2006 U.S. $ 2,842 $ 2,657 $ 2,422 7 % 10 % 7 % 10 % Europe 2,125 1,610 1,449 32 11 21 9 APMEA 616 364 345 69 6 59 9 Other Countries & Corporate (1,704 ) (198 ) (232 ) nm 14 nm 11 Total $ 3,879 $ 4,433 $ 3,984 (12 )% 11 % (18 )% 11 % Latam transaction (1,641 ) Total excluding Latam transaction* $ 5,520 $ 4,433 $ 3,984 25 % 11 % 19 % 11 % * Results for 2007 included the impact of the Latam transaction, which was in Other Countries & Corporate. This impact reflects an impairment charge of $1,665 million, partly offset by a benefit of $24 million due to eliminating depreciation on the assets in Latam in mid-April 2007. In order to provide management’s view of the underlying business performance, results are also shown excluding the impact of the Latam transaction. In 2007 and 2006, U.S. operating income included higher combined restaurant margin dollars compared to 2006 and 2005, respectively. In Europe, results for 2007 were driven by strong performance in France, the U.K. and Russia, as well as positive results in most other markets. Impairment and other charges (credits) benefited the growth rate in 2007. In 2006, results reflected strong performance in France and a gain on the sale of an office building in Russia, partly offset by impairment and other charges. In addition, operating results in the U.K. and Germany contributed to the 2006 increase in operating income. In APMEA, results for 2007 were driven by improved results in China, Japan, Australia, Hong Kong and most other markets. Results for 2006 reflected strong performance in Australia as well as improved results in China and Japan, partly offset by impairment and other charges. In Other Countries & Corporate, results for 2007 and 2006 reflected strong sales performance across most markets in Latin America. Results for 2006 also reflected higher performance-based compensation, as well as costs related to our biennial worldwide owner/operator convention. • Combined operating margin Combined operating margin is defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues. Combined operating margin for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 17.0%, 21.2% and 20.8%, respectively. Impairment and other charges (credits) negatively impacted the 2007 and 2006 combined operating margin by 7.4 percentage points and 0.7 percentage points, respectively, and positively impacted the 2005 combined operating margin by 0.1 percentage point. Interest expense Interest expense for 2007 increased primarily due to higher average interest rates and stronger foreign currencies, partly offset by lower average debt levels. Interest expense for 2006 increased primarily due to higher average debt levels as a result of activity related to HIA, funded by local borrowings in late 2005, and higher average interest rates. In late 2005, the Company repatriated approximately $3 billion of certain foreign historical earnings under HIA.

Translation losses primarily relate to net gains or losses on certain hedges that reduce the exposure to variability on certain intercompany foreign cash flow streams. Other expense primarily consists of gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt and minority interest. Interest income decreased for 2007 primarily due to lower average cash levels, while 2006 increased primarily due to higher cash levels. Provision for income taxes In 2007, 2006 and 2005, the reported effective income tax rates were 34.6%, 31.0%, and 29.6%, respectively. In 2007, the effective income tax rate was higher by about 4 percentage points as a result of the following items: • A negative impact due to a minimal tax benefit of $62 million related to net expense of $1,641 million associated with the Latam transaction. This benefit was minimal due to our inability to utilize most of the capital losses generated by this transaction. • A positive impact due to a benefit of $316 million resulting from the completion of an IRS examination, partly offset by $28 million of expense related to the impact of a tax law change in Canada. In 2005, the effective income tax rate included a benefit of $179 million resulting from the completion of an IRS examination of the Company’s 2000-2002 U.S. tax returns, partly offset by $106 million of expense related to the Company’s decision to take advantage of the one-time opportunity provided under HIA. The net of these items decreased the effective income tax rate by about 2 percentage points. 22 Table of Contents Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.4 billion in 2007 and $1.2 billion in 2006. Substantially all of the net tax assets arose in the U.S. and other profitable markets. Discontinued operations The Company continues to focus its management and financial resources on the McDonald’s restaurant business as it believes the opportunities for long-term growth remain significant. Accordingly, during the third quarter 2007, the Company sold its investment in Boston Market. In 2006, the Company disposed of its investment in Chipotle via public stock offerings in the first and second quarters and a tax-free exchange for McDonald’s common stock in the fourth quarter. As a result of the disposals during 2007 and 2006, both Boston Market’s and Chipotle’s results of operations and transaction gains are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. In connection with the Company’s sale of its investment in Boston Market in August 2007, the Company received proceeds of approximately $250 million and recorded a gain of $69 million after tax. In addition, Boston Market’s net income (loss) for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was ($9) million, $7 million and $9 million, respectively. In first quarter 2006, Chipotle completed an IPO of 6.1 million shares resulting in a tax-free gain to McDonald’s of $32 million to reflect an increase in the carrying value of the Company’s investment as a result of Chipotle selling shares in the public offering. Concurrent with the IPO, McDonald’s sold 3.0 million Chipotle shares, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $61 million and an additional gain of $14 million after tax. In second quarter 2006, McDonald’s sold an additional 4.5 million Chipotle shares, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $267 million and a gain of $128 million after tax, while still retaining majority ownership. In fourth quarter 2006, the Company completely separated from Chipotle through a noncash, tax-free exchange of its remaining Chipotle shares for its common stock. McDonald’s accepted 18.6 million shares of its common stock in exchange for the 16.5 million shares of Chipotle class B common stock held by McDonald’s and recorded a tax-free gain of $480 million. In addition, Chipotle’s net income for 2006 and 2005 was $18 million and $16 million, respectively. Accounting changes • SFAS Statement No. 158 In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS No. 158). SFAS No. 158 requires the Company to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in the Consolidated balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year changes occur through other comprehensive income. The Company adopted the applicable provisions of SFAS No. 158 effective December 31, 2006, as required. This resulted in a net adjustment to other comprehensive income of $89 million, for a limited number of applicable international markets. • EITF Issue 06-2 In June 2006, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 06-2, Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43, Accounting for Compensated Absences (EITF 06-2). Under EITF 06-2, compensation costs associated with a sabbatical should be accrued over the requisite service period, assuming certain conditions are met. Previously, the Company expensed sabbatical costs as incurred. The Company adopted EITF 06-2 effective January 1, 2007, as required and accordingly, we recorded a $36 million cumulative adjustment, net of tax, to decrease the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. The annual impact to earnings of this accounting change is not significant. • FASB Interpretation No. 48 In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which is an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007, as required. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recorded a $20 million cumulative adjustment to increase the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. FIN 48 requires that a liability associated with an unrecognized tax benefit be classified as a long-term liability except for the amount for which cash payment is anticipated within one year. Upon adoption of FIN 48, $339 million of tax liabilities, net of deposits, were reclassified from current to long-term and included in other long-term liabilities. • SFAS Statement No. 157 In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement does not require any new fair value measurements; rather, it applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157, as issued, are effective January 1, 2008. However, in February 2008, the FASB deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for certain non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (i.e., at least annually). We adopted the required provisions of SFAS No. 157 related to debt and derivatives as of January 1, 2008. The annual impact of this accounting change is not expected to be significant. 23 Table of Contents • SFAS Statement No. 159 In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to voluntarily choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS No. 159 is effective beginning January 1, 2008. The Company has decided not to adopt this optional standard. • SFAS Statement No. 141(R) In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141(R), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)). SFAS No. 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective acquisition-date fair values, changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from preacquisition contingencies, and requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred. SFAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. • SFAS Statement No. 160 In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB 51)) (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 becomes effective beginning January 1, 2009 and is required to be adopted prospectively, except for the reclassification of noncontrolling interests to equity and the recasting of net income (loss) attributable to both the controlling and noncontrolling interests, which are required to be adopted retrospectively. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 160 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. CASH FLOWS The Company generates significant cash from operations and has substantial credit capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and debt repayments. Cash provided by operations totaled $4.9 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $2.9 billion in 2007, while cash provided by operations totaled $4.3 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $2.6 billion in 2006. In 2007, cash provided by operations increased $535 million compared to 2006 primarily due to increased operating results and lower income tax payments. In 2006, cash provided by operations was flat compared to 2005 due to increased operating results, offset by changes in working capital primarily due to higher income tax payments. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.2 billion in 2007, a decrease of $124 million compared to 2006, primarily due to net proceeds received from the Latam transaction and the sale of Boston Market in 2007, partly offset by higher capital expenditures in 2007. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.3 billion in 2006, a decrease of $544 million compared to 2005. The increase in capital expenditures was more than offset by the proceeds from the disposition of Chipotle as well as the sales of short-term investments. Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.0 billion in 2007, a decrease of $1.5 billion compared to 2006, primarily due to higher net debt issuances, partly offset by higher treasury stock purchases and an increase in the common stock dividend in 2007 compared to 2006. In 2006, cash used for financing activities totaled $5.5 billion compared to cash provided by financing activities of $442 million in 2005. The 2006 activity reflected higher shares repurchased, higher net debt repayments and an increase in the common stock dividend. As a result of the above activity, the Company’s cash and equivalents balance decreased $147 million in 2007 to $2.0 billion, compared to a decrease of $2.1 billion in 2006. In addition to cash and equivalents and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. Restaurant development and capital expenditures In 2007, the Company opened 743 traditional restaurants and 93 satellite restaurants (small, limited-menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 240 traditional restaurants and 265 satellite restaurants. In 2006, the Company opened 643 traditional restaurants and 101 satellite restaurants, and closed 284 traditional restaurants and 180 satellite restaurants. About 65% of the restaurant openings occurred in the major markets in both 2007 and 2006.

In 2008, the Company expects to open about 950 traditional restaurants and 50 satellite restaurants (of which the U.S., China and six other consolidated markets are expected to open more than 550 restaurants) and close about 250 traditional restaurants and 150 satellite restaurants. Approximately 65% of Company-operated restaurants and about 80% of franchised and affiliated restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2007. Franchisees and affiliates operated 78% of the restaurants at year-end 2007. Capital expenditures increased $205 million or 12% in 2007 and $135 million or 8% in 2006. The increase in capital expenditures in 2007 was primarily due to increased investment in new restaurants, primarily in Europe and the U.S., and the impact of foreign currency translation. The increase in 2006 was primarily due to increased investment in existing restaurants, primarily in the U.S. Capital expenditures in both years reflected 24 Table of Contents the Company’s focus on growing sales at existing restaurants, including reinvestment initiatives such as reimaging in several markets around the world. Capital expenditures related to discontinued operations were $10 million, $82 million and $110 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The expenditures in 2007 primarily related to investment in existing Boston Market restaurants and expenditures in 2006 and 2005, primarily related to new Chipotle restaurants. Capital expenditures invested in major markets, excluding Japan, represented approximately 75% of the total in 2007 and about 70% of the total in 2006 and 2005. Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts.

New restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with acceptable returns and/or opportunities for long-term growth. Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies and leveraging best practices. In addition, foreign currency fluctuations affect average development costs. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, in 2007, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonald’s restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $2.5 million. The Company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for its restaurants at year-end 2007 and 2006. Share repurchases and dividends In 2007, the Company returned approximately $5.7 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid. For 2007 through 2009, the Company expects to return $15 billion to $17 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, subject to business and market conditions.

In October 2001, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a $5.0 billion share repurchase program with no specified expiration date. The Company’s Board of Directors subsequently increased the size of the program by $5.0 billion in March 2006 and $3.0 billion in May 2007. In September 2007, the Company terminated the existing share repurchase program and replaced it with a new share repurchase program that authorizes the purchase of up to $10.0 billion of the Company’s outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date. In 2007, approximately 77 million shares were repurchased for $3.9 billion, of which 27 million shares or $1.6 billion were purchased under the new program. The Company reduced its shares outstanding at year end by over 3% compared with 2006, after considering stock option exercises. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 32 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. In 2007, the Company increased the annual dividend 50% to $1.50 per share or $1.8 billion. At $1.50 per share, the Company’s dividend is now more than six times higher than the $0.235 per share paid in 2002, reflecting the Company’s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs. The Company’s Board of Directors has decided that beginning in 2008, dividends declared will be paid on a quarterly basis, at the Board’s discretion. FINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Total assets and returns Total assets increased by $417 million or 1% in 2007. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased total assets by approximately $1.4 billion in 2007. This increase was partly offset by the sales of the Latam businesses and Boston Market in 2007. About 70% of total assets were located in the consolidated major markets at year-end 2007. Net property and equipment increased $1.5 billion in 2007 and represented about 70% of total assets at year end. Operating income, which excludes interest income, is used to compute return on average assets, while income from continuing operations is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. Assets of discontinued operations are excluded from the average assets since operating income excludes results from discontinued operations. Returns on assets and equity 2007 2006 2005 Return on average assets 13.2 % 15.0 % 14.6 % Return on average common equity 15.1 18.4 17.6 Return on average assets has been negatively impacted by significantly higher cash and equivalents balances due in part to the Company’s repatriation of earnings related to HIA in 2005. Cash and equivalents reduced return on average assets by 1.3 percentage points, 2.1 percentage points and 1.2 percentage points in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 25 Table of Contents Impairment and other charges (credits), net reduced/(increased) return on average assets by 5.4 percentage points, 0.4 percentage points and (0.2) percentage points in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In addition, these items along with the 2007 and 2005 net tax benefit resulting from the completion of IRS examinations and incremental tax expense in connection with HIA, reduced/(increased) return on average common equity by 8.5 percentage points, 0.6 percentage points and (0.5) percentage points in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2007 and 2006, return on average assets and return on average common equity both benefited from strong operating results in the U.S. and Europe, as well as improved results in APMEA. During 2008, the Company will continue to concentrate restaurant openings and new capital invested in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long-term growth. Financing and market risk The Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2007 totaled $9.3 billion, compared with $8.4 billion at December 31, 2006. The net increase in 2007 was primarily due to net issuances of $573 million and the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt of $342 million, partly offset by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133) noncash fair value adjustments of $23 million.

See Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements. (3) Includes the effect of interest rate and foreign currency exchange agreements. Fitch, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s currently rate the Company’s commercial paper F1, A-1 and P-2, respectively; and its long-term debt A, A and A3, respectively. Historically, the Company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt. The Company’s key metrics for monitoring its credit structure are shown in the preceding table. While the Company targets these metrics for ease of focus, it also considers similar credit ratios that incorporate capitalized operating leases to estimate total adjusted debt. Total adjusted debt, a term that is commonly used by the rating agencies referred to above, includes debt outstanding on the Company’s balance sheet plus an adjustment to capitalize operating leases. Based on their most recent calculations, these agencies add between $7 billion and $11 billion to debt for lease capitalization purposes, which increases total debt as a percent of total capitalization and reduces cash provided by operations as a percent of total debt for credit rating purposes. The Company believes the rating agency methodology for capitalizing leases requires certain adjustments. These adjustments include: excluding percent rents in excess of minimum rents; excluding certain Company-operated restaurant lease agreements outside the U.S. that are cancelable with minimal penalties (representing approximately 25% of Company-operated restaurant minimum rents outside the U.S., based on the Company’s estimate); capitalizing non-restaurant leases using a multiple of three times rent expense; and reducing total rent expense by a percentage of the annual minimum rent payments due to the Company from franchisees operating on leased sites. Based on this calculation, for credit analysis purposes, approximately $4 billion of future operating lease payments would be capitalized. Certain of the Company’s debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company’s business. The Company has approximately $7.3 billion of authority to issue debt securities, including debt securities registered on a U.S. shelf registration statement and in connection with a Euro Medium-Term Notes program. The Company also has $1.3 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement (see Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements) and authority to issue commercial paper. In 2008, the Company expects to issue commercial paper and long-term debt in order to refinance maturing debt and finance a portion of the Company’s previously disclosed expectation to return $15 billion to $17 billion to shareholders. Debt maturing in 2008 includes approximately $1.8 billion of outstanding borrowings under the HIA multi-currency term loan facility and $800 million of long-term corporate debt. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All exchange agreements are over-the-counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. Derivatives were recorded at fair value in the Company’s Consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2007 and 2006 in miscellaneous other assets of $64 million and $41 million, respectively, and other long-term liabilities of $70 million and $117 million, respectively. See Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments for additional information regarding their use and the impact of SFAS No. 133 regarding derivatives. 26 Table of Contents The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt, including the effects of foreign currency exchange agreements, was $6.1 billion and $6.8 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company was required to post collateral of $55 million and $49 million, respectively, which was used to reduce the carrying value of the derivatives recorded in other long-term liabilities. The Company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Company’s largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures IN MILLIONS OF U.S. DOLLARS 2007 2006 Euro $ 3,999 $ 2,758 Australian Dollars 1,147 837 Canadian Dollars 929 1,099 British Pounds Sterling 634 770 Russian Ruble 463 359 The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the U.S. Based on the results of these analyses of the Company’s financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2007 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2007 levels would materially affect the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. Contractual obligations and commitments The Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2007. (See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.)

Debt obligations do not include $85 million of SFAS No. 133 noncash fair value adjustments because these adjustments have no impact on the obligation at maturity, as well as $148 million of accrued interest. The Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of IRS limitations. The investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market-rate investment alternatives under the Company’s qualified Profit Sharing and Savings Plan. Total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $415 million at December 31, 2007 and $379 million at December 31, 2006 and were included in other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet. Also included in other long-term liabilities at December 31, 2007 were gross unrecognized tax benefits of $250 million and liabilities for international retirement plans of $129 million. In connection with the Latam transaction, the Company has agreed to indemnify the buyers for certain tax and other claims, certain of which are reflected as liabilities in McDonald’s Consolidated balance sheet totaling $179 million at year-end 2007. OTHER MATTERS Critical accounting policies and estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions. 27 Table of Contents The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity: • Property and equipment Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods. • Share-based compensation The Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, such as the expected life of the stock option and expected volatility of the Company’s stock over the expected life, which significantly impact the assumed fair value. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. • Long-lived assets impairment review Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Company’s long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Company’s experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. When the Company sells an existing business to a developmental licensee, it determines when these businesses are “held for sale” in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets. Impairment charges on assets held for sale are recognized when management and, if required, the Company’s Board of Directors have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal, the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than the assets’ net book value, among other factors. An impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the net book value of the business (including foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity) and the estimated cash sales price, less costs of disposal. An alternative accounting policy would be to recharacterize some or all of any loss as an intangible asset and amortize it to expense over future periods based on the term of the relevant licensing arrangement and as revenue is recognized for royalties and initial fees. Under this alternative for the Latam transaction, approximately $900 million of the $1.7 billion impairment charge could have been recharacterized as an intangible asset and amortized over the franchise term of 20 years, resulting in about $45 million of expense annually. This policy would be based on a view that the consideration for the sale consists of two components–the cash sales price and the future royalties and initial fees. The Company bases its accounting policy on management’s determination that royalties payable under its developmental license arrangements are substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements. The Company does not believe it would be appropriate to recognize an asset for the right to receive market-based fees in future periods, particularly given the continuing support and services provided to the licensees. Therefore, the Company believes that the recognition of an impairment charge based on the net cash sales price reflects the substance of the sale transaction. • Litigation accruals From time to time, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. 28 Table of Contents • Income taxes The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. During 2007, the Company recorded a $316 million benefit as a result of the completion of an IRS examination of the Company’s 2003-2004 U.S. tax returns. During 2005, the Company recorded a $179 million benefit due to the completion of an IRS examination of the Company’s 2000-2002 U.S. tax returns. The Company’s 2005-2006 U.S. tax returns are under audit and the completion is expected in late 2008 or early 2009. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $6.7 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If management’s intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. Effects of changing prices - inflation The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. Reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Company’s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization, from the base period, adjusted for the impact of the Latam developmental license transaction in 2007. While the Company has previously converted certain other markets to a developmental license structure, management believes the Latam transaction and the associated charge are not indicative of ongoing operations due to the size and scope of the transaction. Management believes that the adjusted operating results better reflect the underlying business trends relevant to the periods presented. The denominator is the weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one- or three-year period. Adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less cash generated from investing activities related to the Boston Market, Chipotle and Latam transactions. The weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter’s investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2007 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2007 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2006 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full year impact on 2007 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2006 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average. 29 Table of Contents The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one-year and three-year ROIIC are as follows: One-year ROIIC calculation Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 Incremental change NUMERATOR: Operating income $3,879.0 $4,433.0 $ (554.0 ) Depreciation and amortization(1) 1,192.8 1,190.9 1.9 Latam transaction 1,665.3 1,665.3 Currency translation (2) (257.0 ) Incremental adjusted operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates) $ 856.2 DENOMINATOR: Weighted–average adjusted cash used for investing activities(3) $ 1,714.9 Currency translation (2) 1.2 Weighted–average adjusted cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates) $ 1,716.1 One-year ROIIC(4) 49.9 % (1) Represents depreciation and amortization from continuing operations.

63908,MCD,MCDONALDS CORP,2009,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Description of the business The Company franchises and operates McDonald’s restaurants. Of the 31,967 restaurants in 118 countries at year-end 2008, 25,465 were operated by franchisees (including 18,402 operated by conventional franchisees, 2,926 operated by developmental licensees and 4,137 operated by foreign affiliated markets (affiliates)—primarily in Japan) and 6,502 were operated by the Company. Under our conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and décor of their restaurant businesses, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees. Under our developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, while the Company has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market. We view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and continually review our mix of Company-operated and franchised (conventional franchised, developmental licensed and affiliated) restaurants to deliver a great customer experience and drive profitability. In most cases, franchising is the best way to achieve both goals. Although direct restaurant operation is more capital-intensive relative to franchising and results in lower restaurant margins as a percent of revenues, Company-operated restaurants are important to our success in both mature and developing markets. In our Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with our franchisees, we further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced Systemwide. In addition, we firmly believe that owning restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and essential to providing Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. Our Company-operated business also helps to facilitate strategic changes in restaurant ownership. The Company’s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and may include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. The business is managed as distinct geographic segments. Significant reportable segments include the United States (U.S.), Europe, and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA). In addition, throughout this report we present “Other Countries & Corporate” that includes operations in Canada and Latin America, as well as Corporate activities. The U.S., Europe and APMEA segments account for 34%, 42% and 18% of total revenues, respectively. France, Germany and the United Kingdom (U.K.), collectively, account for approximately 55% of Europe’s revenues; and Australia, China and Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), collectively, account for over 50% of APMEA’s revenues. These six markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as “major markets” throughout this report and comprise over 70% of total revenues. The Company continues to focus its management and financial resources on the McDonald’s restaurant business as we believe the opportunities for long-term growth remain significant. Accordingly, in second quarter 2008, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in U.K.-based Pret A Manger for $229 million. In connection with the sale, the Company recognized a nonoperating gain. During the third quarter 2007, the Company sold its investment in Boston Market. In 2006, the Company disposed of its investment in Chipotle Mexican Grill (Chipotle) via public stock offerings and a tax-free exchange for McDonald’s common stock. As a result of the disposals during 2007 and 2006, both Boston Market’s and Chipotle’s results of operations and transaction gains have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. In analyzing business trends, management considers a variety of performance and financial measures, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth, restaurant margins and returns. • Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because they believe this better represents the Company’s underlying business trends. • Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the Company’s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. McDonald’s reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays, weekend days and timing of holidays in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts. The Company refers to these impacts as calendar shift/trading day adjustments. These impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have the greatest effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal. In 2008, there was an incremental full day of sales and guest counts due to the leap year. • Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. While sales by franchisees are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company’s financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and 12 Table of Contents records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of our franchisee base. • Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the adjusted cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation assumes a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. Strategic direction and financial performance The strength of the alignment between the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the System) has been key to McDonald’s success over the years. This business model enables McDonald’s to consistently deliver locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve. In addition, it facilitates our ability to identify, implement and scale innovative ideas that meet our customers’ changing needs and preferences. McDonald’s customer-centered Plan to Win — which is focused on being better, not just bigger — provides a common framework for our restaurants yet allows for local adaptation. The Plan facilitates the execution of multiple initiatives surrounding the five factors of exceptional customer experiences — people, products, place, price and promotion. Through the execution of these initiatives, we have enhanced the McDonald’s experience for customers worldwide, growing sales and guest counts in each of the last five years. This Plan, coupled with financial discipline, has delivered strong results for shareholders. We have exceeded our long-term, constant currency financial targets of average annual Systemwide sales and revenue growth of 3% to 5%; average annual operating income growth of 6% to 7%; and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens every year since the Plan’s implementation in 2003, after adjusting 2007 for the Latin America developmental license transaction. Given the size and scope of our global business, we believe these financial targets are realistic and sustainable, enabling us to focus on those opportunities that best optimize long-term shareholder value. In 2008, we continued to focus on our key global success factors of branded affordability, menu variety and beverage choice, convenience and daypart expansion, ongoing restaurant reinvestment and operations excellence. Locally-relevant initiatives around each of these success factors resonated with consumers’ increasingly busy lifestyles and their growing demand for menu variety, value and simple, enjoyable eating-out experiences. As a result, every area of the world contributed to 2008 global comparable sales and guest counts increasing 6.9% and 3.1%, respectively, despite a challenging economic environment in many countries. In the U.S., we continued to drive sales higher and increase our share of the informal eating-out market in 2008 due to our ongoing focus on breakfast, chicken, beverages, convenience and branded affordability. We extended our leadership in the breakfast and chicken categories with the launch of the Southern Style Chicken Biscuit for breakfast and Southern Style Chicken Sandwich for the remainder of the day. We profitably built greater visit frequency by leveraging our convenient locations, extended hours, drive-thru service and value-oriented local beverage promotions that often featured our popular Iced Coffee and Sweet Tea. As part of our multi-year strategy to take advantage of the significant and growing beverage category, we began rolling-out espresso-based hot and cold specialty coffees. At year-end 2008, over 7,000 restaurants were offering the new specialty coffees, and we expect to complete the roll-out in mid-2009. To accommodate the related new equipment as well as enable potential future offerings such as smoothies, frappes and bottled beverages, construction is required in many restaurants. In most cases this construction also involves expanding and optimizing the efficiency of our drive-thru booth, which enables us to better serve even more customers, faster. The Company is investing capital to fund a portion of this construction-related reinvestment for franchised restaurants. In Europe, we posted record-high comparable sales growth in 2008. Every country contributed to this performance, which was led by France, the U.K., Russia and Germany. This success was driven in part by greater local customer relevance created by our tiered menu approach, featuring an effective combination of premium selections, classic menu favorites, everyday value and popular limited-time food promotions. We also connected with customers throughout the day with new sandwiches such as the Bacon Roll for breakfast in the U.K. and premium M burger in France, Germany and the U.K. We continued upgrading the McDonald’s experience by reimaging more than 650 locations, primarily in the U.K. and Germany. In addition, we continued the roll-out of a new kitchen operating system — currently in about 5,000 of our European restaurants — to enhance operational efficiency and support greater menu variety. Open communication and transparency is especially important to European consumers. To build brand trust, we actively communicated the facts about McDonald’s as an employer and highlighted the quality and nutrition of our food with the early launch of the Company’s new global packaging design. In APMEA, our momentum continued with nearly every country delivering positive comparable sales, driven by Australia, Japan and China. In addition, aggressive restaurant development in China — where we opened our 1,000th restaurant — contributed to revenue growth. Our performance was driven by strategic initiatives surrounding convenience, breakfast, core menu extensions and value. We further enhanced McDonald’s convenience with drive-thru and delivery service, as well as expansion of extended hours to 60% (or about 5,000) of our restaurants in APMEA. We built on the momentum of our breakfast business, currently in 70% of our restaurants in APMEA, by raising customer awareness, trial and visit frequency with relevant marketing and new menu offerings like the egg, tomato and pepper McPuff in China. We also continued to appeal to customers with branded affordability platforms and locally-relevant new product launches such as the premium chicken line in Australia and New Zealand. Our customer-centered strategies to drive global momentum also consider price and product mix as a means to enhance restaurant profitability. This approach is complemented by a focus on optimizing restaurant operations and effectively managing food and paper costs by leveraging our scale, supply chain infrastructure and risk management strategies. As a result, amid a volatile commodity environment, McDonald’s delivered consolidated Company-operated restaurant margins of 17.6% – its highest in nine years. Strong sales and margin performance positively impacted growth in cash from operations, which rose $1 billion to $5.9 billion in 2008. Our substantial cash flow, strong credit rating and continued access to credit provides us significant flexibility to 13 Table of Contents fund capital expenditures and debt repayments as well as return cash to shareholders. In 2008, capital expenditures of $2.1 billion were primarily used to open 995 restaurants (590 net, after 405 closings) and reimage 1,450 locations. In addition, we believe strongly in returning cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. In 2008, we returned $5.8 billion to shareholders, consisting of $1.8 billion in dividends and $4.0 billion in share repurchases. This brings total cash returned to $11.5 billion under our 2007-2009 $15 billion to $17 billion target. We are confident we will achieve this cash return target given the ongoing strength and stability of cash from operations and our continued evolution toward a more heavily franchised, less capital-intensive business model. We believe locally-owned and operated restaurants are at the core of our competitive advantage, making us not just a global brand but also a locally relevant one. In addition, an optimized mix of franchised and Company-operated restaurants helps to maximize brand performance and further enhance the reliability of our cash flow and returns. To that end, in August 2007, the Company completed the sale of its businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and 13 other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, which totaled 1,571 restaurants, to a developmental licensee organization. Under the new ownership structure, the Company receives royalties in these markets instead of a combination of Company-operated sales and franchised rents and royalties. In addition, in 2007 we set a three-year target to refranchise 1,000 to 1,500 existing Company-operated restaurants between 2008 and 2010, primarily in our major markets. In 2008, we refranchised about 675 restaurants, increasing the percent of franchised restaurants worldwide to 80% from 78% at year-end 2007. This transition to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants is expected to affect consolidated financial statements as follows: • A negative impact on consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales shift to franchised sales where we receive rent and/or royalties, along with initial fees. • A decrease in Company-operated margin dollars and an increase in franchised margin dollars, while margin percentages will vary based on sales and cost structures of refranchised restaurants. • Fluctuations in Other Operating (Income) Expense due to gains and/or losses resulting from sales of restaurants. • An increase in combined operating margin percent. • An increase in return on average assets due primarily to a decrease in average asset balances. Highlights from the year included: • Comparable sales grew 6.9% and guest counts rose 3.1%, building on 2007 increases of 6.8% and 3.8%, respectively. • Systemwide sales increased 11% (9% in constant currencies). • Company-operated margins improved to 17.6% and franchised margins improved to 82.3%. • Net income per share from continuing operations was $3.76, an increase of 16% after adjusting for the impact of the 2007 Latin America transaction. • Cash provided by operations totaled $5.9 billion and capital expenditures totaled $2.1 billion. • Returned $5.8 billion to shareholders through shares repurchased and dividends paid, including a 33% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.50 per share for the fourth quarter – bringing our current annual dividend rate to $2.00 per share. • One-year ROIIC was 38.9% and three-year ROIIC was 37.5% for 2008. Outlook for 2009 We will continue to drive success in 2009 and beyond by remaining focused on being better, not just bigger. We will do so by further enhancing our understanding of consumers’ needs and wants; facilitating greater sharing and adoption of best practices and new ideas worldwide; and leveraging a strategic approach to implementing initiatives to drive the best bottom-line impact. Despite challenging economic conditions, the McDonald’s System is energized by our current worldwide momentum. We will continue to build on our strength in five key areas: maintaining the balance between price and value; maximizing the benefit of available capital by improving the relevance and contemporary feel of our existing restaurants; leveraging the equity and unique tastes of core menu favorites like the Big Mac, the Quarter Pounder with Cheese and our world-famous French Fries; continuing our financial discipline and evaluation of success measures to ensure these measures are driving actions that positively impact our restaurants; and furthering operations excellence by focusing on improved execution. As we do so, we are confident we can meet or exceed the long-term constant currency financial targets previously discussed. In the U.S., our 2009 focus is to continue to build relevance and loyalty by staying connected to customers’ needs for menu variety and beverage choice, everyday affordability and convenience. Our initiatives will include reminding customers of the enduring appeal of menu classics such as the Big Mac and encouraging trial of new sandwich and beverage options including specialty coffees. Also in 2009, we will continue to offer value across our menu from the Dollar Menu to our premium products, as well as our classic menu favorites and mid-tier offerings such as our Double Cheeseburger and Snack Wraps. These initiatives combined with the convenience of our locations, optimized drive-thru service, cashless transactions and longer operating hours will reinforce McDonald’s position as our customers’ preferred place and way to eat. Our priorities in Europe remain upgrading the customer and employee experience, enhancing local relevance and building brand transparency. In 2009, we will continue upgrading our restaurants’ ambiance through reimaging, including adding another 200 McCafes primarily in Germany and France. In addition, we will focus on optimizing our drive-thru service, completing the conversion of our kitchen operating system in most European restaurants and increasing total locations offering extended and 24-hour service. We also will strengthen our local relevance by complementing our tiered menu with new products and a relevant variety of limited-time food events featuring beef, chicken, desserts and coffee selections. In the area of brand transparency, we will remain open and accessible and will continue to inform consumers about our food quality and reputation as an employer. In APMEA, our goal is to be consumers’ first choice when eating out. To achieve this goal, locally-relevant strategies surrounding convenience, breakfast and branded affordability are essential in this diverse and dynamic part of the world. Convenience initiatives include leveraging the success of 24-hour or extended operating hours, offering delivery service and building our drive-thru 14 Table of Contents traffic. We will also aggressively continue to open new restaurants in China. We will further build our breakfast business in APMEA by increasing the number of locations where it is served, utilizing innovative marketing support and launching new products. At the same time, we will continue to highlight our classic menu favorites and offer locally-relevant extensions of these products. In addition, we are further leveraging a strategic pricing tool to optimize menu prices to drive sales and profits. In 2009, we will continue to optimize the mix of franchised and Company-operated restaurants and will refranchise restaurants under the previously mentioned target. The speed with which we make progress toward this goal will depend on our ability to identify the appropriate prospective franchisees with the experience and financial resources in the relevant markets. We will also continue to evaluate several small markets in APMEA and Europe for potential transition to developmental license structures. We will only convert such markets when we believe that we have identified a qualified licensee and our business is ready for transition to optimize the transaction for the long-term. As previously discussed, our evolution toward a more heavily franchised, less capital-intensive business model has favorable implications for the amount of capital we invest, the strength and stability of our cash flow and our long-term returns. As a result, we expect free cash flow — cash from operations less capital expenditures — will continue to grow and be a significant source to fund total cash returned to shareholders. In addition, we expect our share repurchase activity will continue to yield reductions in our outstanding share count. Finally, we will continue to be disciplined financially, remaining diligent about how and where we invest capital and selling, general and administrative expenses to grow our business. Consistent with the last few years, to drive sales and returns we will allocate nearly 50% of our $2.1 billion of planned 2009 capital expenditures toward reinvestments in existing restaurants, mainly related to the reimaging of locations in Europe and the rollout of the beverage strategy in the U.S. The remainder of our capital expenditures will primarily be used to build new locations. McDonald’s does not provide specific guidance on net income per share. The following information is provided to assist in analyzing the Company’s results: • Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add nearly 2 percentage points to 2009 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies), most of which will be due to the 709 net traditional restaurants added in 2008. • The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point increase in comparable sales for either the U.S. or Europe would increase annual net income per share by about 3 cents. • With about 75% of McDonald’s grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Company’s commodity costs. For the full year 2009, the total basket of goods is expected to rise about 5% to 5.5% in the U.S. and about 4% to 4.5% in Europe with more of this pressure occurring in the first half of the year. Some volatility may be experienced between quarters in the normal course of business. • The Company expects full-year 2009 selling, general & administrative expenses to decline, in constant currencies, although fluctuations may be experienced between quarters due to certain items in 2008 such as the biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention and the Beijing Summer Olympics. • Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense in 2009 to be relatively flat compared with 2008. Interest income in 2009 is expected to decrease about 80% compared with 2008 due to expected lower average interest rates and average cash balances. • A significant part of the Company’s operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 45% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 70% of the Company’s operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction compared with 2008, the Company’s annual net income per share would change by about 12 to 15 cents. Due to the recent strengthening of the U.S. Dollar relative to virtually all foreign currencies, full year 2009 revenues and operating income will likely be negatively impacted by foreign currency translation. • The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2009 to be approximately 29% to 31%. In the normal course of business and based on the timing of certain transactions and events, some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate that is outside the annual range. • The Company expects capital expenditures for 2009 to be approximately $2.1 billion. About half of this amount will be reinvested in existing restaurants while the rest will primarily be used to open about 1,000 restaurants (950 traditional and 50 satellites). The Company expects net additions of about 650 restaurants (750 net traditional additions and 100 net satellite closings). These restaurant numbers include new unit openings (approximately 30%) in affiliated and developmental licensed markets, such as Japan and Latin America, where the Company does not fund any capital expenditures. • For 2007 through 2009, the Company expects to return $15 billion to $17 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, subject to business and market conditions. For 2007 and 2008 combined, the Company returned $11.5 billion to shareholders. • The Company continually reviews its restaurant ownership structures to optimize cash flow and returns and to enhance local relevance. The Company expects to refranchise 1,000 to 1,500 Company-operated restaurants between 2008 and 2010, primarily in its major markets, and by continuing to utilize its developmental license strategy. In 2008, the Company refranchised about 675 restaurants, primarily in its major markets. • In February 2009, consistent with its focus on the McDonald’s restaurant business, McDonald’s agreed to sell its minority interest in Redbox Automated Retail, LLC, an automated DVD rental service. The Company expects to recognize a nonoperating gain upon the closing of the transaction in first quarter 2009. 15 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS Operating results 2008 2007 2006 Dollars in millions, except per share data Amount Increase/ (decrease) Amount Increase/ (decrease) Amount Revenues Sales by Company-operated restaurants $ 16,561 — % $ 16,611 8 % $ 15,402 Revenues from franchised restaurants 6,961 13 6,176 12 5,493 Total revenues 23,522 3 22,787 9 20,895 Operating costs and expenses Company-operated restaurant expenses 13,653 (1 ) 13,742 6 12,905 Franchised restaurants—occupancy expenses 1,230 8 1,140 8 1,058 Selling, general & administrative expenses 2,355 — 2,367 3 2,296 Impairment and other charges, net 6 nm 1,670 nm 134 Other operating (income) expense, net (165 ) nm (11 ) nm 69 Total operating costs and expenses 17,079 (10 ) 18,908 15 16,462 Operating income 6,443 66 3,879 (12 ) 4,433 Interest expense 523 27 410 2 402 Nonoperating (income) expense, net (78 ) 25 (103 ) (16 ) (123 ) Gain on sale of investment (160 ) nm Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes 6,158 72 3,572 (14 ) 4,154 Provision for income taxes 1,845 49 1,237 (4 ) 1,288 Income from continuing operations 4,313 85 2,335 (19 ) 2,866 Income from discontinued operations (net of taxes of $35 and $102) nm 60 nm 678 Net income $ 4,313 80 % $ 2,395 (32 )% $ 3,544 Income per common share–diluted Continuing operations $ 3.76 95 % $ 1.93 (16 )% $ 2.29 Discontinued operations nm 0.05 nm 0.54 Net income $ 3.76 90 % $ 1.98 (30 )% $ 2.83 Weighted-average common shares outstanding–diluted 1,146.0 1,211.8 1,251.7 nm Not meaningful. In August 2007, the Company completed the sale of its businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and 13 other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, which totaled 1,571 restaurants, to a developmental licensee organization. The Company refers to these markets as “Latam.” As a result of the Latam transaction, the Company receives royalties in these markets instead of a combination of Company-operated sales and franchised rents and royalties. Based on approval by the Company’s Board of Directors on April 17, 2007, the Company concluded Latam was “held for sale” as of that date in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.7 billion in 2007, substantially all of which was noncash. The charge included $896 million for the difference between the net book value of the Latam business and approximately $675 million in cash proceeds received. This loss in value was primarily due to a historically difficult economic environment coupled with volatility experienced in many of the markets included in this transaction. The charges also included historical foreign currency translation losses of $769 million recorded in shareholders’ equity. The Company recorded a tax benefit of $62 million in 2007 in connection with this transaction. As a result of meeting the “held for sale” criteria, the Company ceased recording depreciation expense with respect to Latam effective April 17, 2007. In connection with the sale, the Company agreed to indemnify the buyers for certain tax and other claims, certain of which are reflected as liabilities on McDonald’s Consolidated balance sheet, totaling $142 million at December 31, 2008 and $179 million at December 31, 2007. The change in the balance was primarily due to foreign currency translation. The Company mitigates the currency impact to income through the use of forward foreign exchange agreements. The buyers of the Company’s operations in Latam entered into a 20-year master franchise agreement that requires the buyers, among other obligations to (i) pay monthly royalties commencing at a rate of approximately 5% of gross sales of the restaurants in these markets, substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements; (ii) commit to adding approximately 150 new McDonald’s restaurants by the end of 2010 and pay an initial fee for each new restaurant opened; and (iii) commit to specified annual capital expenditures for existing restaurants. 16 Table of Contents In addition to the consolidated operating results shown on the previous page, consolidated results for 2007 and adjusted growth rates for 2008 and 2007 are presented in the following table excluding the impact of the Latam transaction. These results include the effect of foreign currency translation further discussed in the section titled Impact of foreign currency translation on reported results. While the Company has converted certain other markets to a developmental license arrangement, management believes the Latam transaction and the associated charge are not indicative of ongoing operations due to the size and scope of the transaction. Management believes that the adjusted operating results better reflect the underlying business trends relevant to the periods presented.

(1) The results for the full year 2007 included impairment and other charges of $1,665 million, partly offset by a benefit of $24 million due to eliminating depreciation on the assets in Latam in mid-April 2007, and a tax benefit of $62 million. (2) The following items impact the comparison of adjusted growth in diluted income per share from continuing operations and diluted net income per share for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with 2007. On a net basis, these items negatively impact the comparison by 7 and 6 percentage points, respectively: 2008 • $0.09 per share gain on the sale of the Company’s minority interest in Pret A Manger. 2007 • $0.26 per share of income tax benefit resulting from the completion of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination of the Company’s 2003-2004 U.S. federal income tax returns; partly offset by • $0.02 per share of income tax expense related to the impact of a tax law change in Canada. (3) The following items impact the comparison of adjusted growth in diluted income per share from continuing operations and diluted net income per share for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared with 2006. On a net basis, these items positively impact the comparison by 15 and 12 percentage points, respectively: 2007 • $0.26 per share of income tax benefit resulting from the completion of an IRS examination of the Company’s 2003-2004 U.S. federal income tax returns; partly offset by • $0.02 per share of income tax expense related to the impact of a tax law change in Canada. 2006 • $0.08 per share of operating expenses primarily related to strategic actions taken to enhance overall profitability and improve returns; and • $0.01 per share of incremental income tax expense primarily related to the impact of a tax law change in Canada. Net income and diluted net income per common share In 2008, net income and diluted net income per common share were $4.3 billion and $3.76. Results benefited by a $109 million, or $0.09 per share, gain on the sale of the Company’s minority interest in Pret A Manger. In 2007, net income and diluted net income per common share were $2.4 billion and $1.98. Income from continuing operations was $2.3 billion or $1.93 per share, which included $1.6 billion or $1.30 per share of net expense related to the Latam transaction. This reflects an impairment charge of $1.32 per share, partly offset by a $0.02 per share benefit due to eliminating depreciation on the assets in Latam in mid-April 2007 in accordance with accounting rules. In addition, 2007 results included a net tax benefit of $288 million or $0.24 per share resulting from the completion of an IRS examination of the Company’s 2003-2004 U.S. federal income tax returns, partly offset by the impact of a tax law change in Canada. Income from discontinued operations was $60 million or $0.05 per share. In 2006, net income and diluted net income per common share were $3.5 billion and $2.83. Income from continuing operations was $2.9 billion or $2.29 per share, which included $134 million ($98 million after tax or $0.08 per share) of impairment and other charges primarily related to strategic actions taken to enhance overall profitability and improve returns, as well as $0.01 per share of net incremental income tax expense primarily related to the impact of a tax law change in Canada. Income from discontinued operations was $678 million or $0.54 per share. Refer to the Impairment and other charges, net and Discontinued operations sections for further discussion. The Company repurchased 69.7 million shares of its stock for $4.0 billion in 2008 and 77.1 million shares for $3.9 billion in 2007, driving reductions of over 4% and 3% of total shares outstanding, respectively, net of stock option exercises. 17 Table of Contents Impact of foreign currency translation on reported results While changing foreign currencies affect reported results, McDonald’s mitigates exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows, and purchasing goods and services in local currencies. In 2008, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results, driven by the stronger Euro and most other currencies, partly offset by the weaker British Pound. However, in fourth quarter 2008, the U.S. Dollar strengthened significantly against nearly every foreign currency, reducing the full year foreign currency benefit. Due to this strengthening, full year 2009 revenues and operating income will likely be negatively impacted by foreign currency translation. In 2007, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results, primarily driven by the stronger Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. In 2006, consolidated operating results were positively impacted by the stronger Euro, Canadian Dollar and British Pound.

Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and may include initial fees. In both 2008 and 2007, consolidated revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales as well as stronger foreign currencies. Revenue growth in both years was negatively impacted by the Latam transaction. Upon completion of the Latam transaction in August 2007, the Company receives royalties based on a percent of sales in these markets instead of a combination of Company-operated sales and franchised rents and royalties. Revenue growth in 2008 was also partly offset by the impact of the refranchising strategy in certain of the Company’s major markets, which resulted in a higher proportion of franchised restaurants compared with 2007.

New products introduced in 2008 included Southern Style Chicken products, Iced Coffee and Sweet Tea, while new products introduced in 2007 included the Southwest Salad and an extended Snack Wrap line. In 2008, revenue growth was largely offset by the impact of the refranchising strategy. Europe’s constant currency increase in revenues in 2008 and 2007 was primarily due to strong comparable sales in Russia (which is entirely Company-operated), France and the U.K., as well as positive comparable sales in all other markets. These increases were partly offset by the impact of the refranchising strategy, primarily in the U.K. and Germany in 2008 and in the U.K. in 2007. In APMEA, the constant currency increases in revenues in 2008 and 2007 were primarily driven by strong comparable sales in Australia and China, as well as positive comparable sales throughout the segment. In addition, expansion in China contributed to the increases in both years. In Other Countries & Corporate, Company-operated sales declined in 2008 and 2007 while franchised revenues increased primarily as a result of the Latam transaction in August 2007. The following tables present Systemwide sales and comparable sales increases: Systemwide sales increases Excluding currency translation 2008 2007 2008 2007 U.S. 5 % 5 % 5 % 5 % Europe 15 18 10 9 APMEA 19 17 12 13 Other Countries & Corporate 16 19 14 12 Total 11 % 12 % 9 % 8 % Comparable sales increases 2008 2007 2006 U.S. 4.0 % 4.5 % 5.2 % Europe 8.5 7.6 5.8 APMEA 9.0 10.6 5.5 Other Countries & Corporate 13.0 10.8 9.4 Total 6.9 % 6.8 % 5.7 % Restaurant Margins The Company continues to optimize its restaurant ownership mix, cash flow and returns through its refranchising strategy and expects the shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants to negatively impact consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales shift to franchised sales, where we receive rent and/or royalties. In addition, the Company expects a decrease in Company-operated margin dollars and an increase in franchised margin dollars, while margin percentages will vary based on sales and cost structures of refranchised restaurants. • Franchised margins Franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised restaurants less the Company’s occupancy costs (rent and depreciation) associated with those sites. Franchised margin dollars represented about 65% of the combined restaurant margins in 2008, 2007 and 2006. Franchised margin dollars increased $695 million or 14% (11% in constant currencies) in 2008 and $601 million or 14% (10% in constant currencies) in 2007. The August 2007 Latam transaction contributed to the growth in franchised margin dollars in both 2008 and 2007 and the refranchising strategy contributed to the growth in 2008.

In 2008, the U.S. franchised margin percent was negatively impacted by the refranchising strategy. Europe’s franchised margin percent increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to strong comparable sales in most markets, partly offset by the impact of the refranchising strategy. Higher rent expense and the cost of strategic brand and sales building initiatives also negatively affected the franchised margin percent in 2008. The Company will continue to execute these strategies, which are designed to drive comparable guest count growth and long term profitability and are expected to negatively impact the 2009 franchised margin percent. In Other Countries & Corporate, the franchised margin percent increased in 2008 and 2007 as a result of the Latam transaction. The Company receives royalties based on a percent of sales in these markets. The franchised margin percent in APMEA and, beginning in 2008, Other Countries & Corporate is higher relative to the U.S. and Europe due to a large proportion of developmental licensed and/or affiliated restaurants where we have royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs. • Company-operated margins Company-operated margin dollars represent sales by Company-operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. Company-operated margin dollars increased $39 million or 1% (decreased 1% in constant currencies) in 2008 and increased $372 million or 15% (10% in constant currencies) in 2007. After the Latam transaction in August 2007, there are no Company-operated restaurants remaining in Latin America. Company-operated margin dollars were negatively impacted by this transaction in 2008 and 2007 and by the refranchising strategy in 19 Table of Contents 2008. The refranchising strategy had a positive impact on the margin percent in 2008, primarily in the U.S. and Europe.

Europe’s Company-operated margin percent increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to strong comparable sales, partly offset by higher commodity and labor costs. In APMEA, the Company-operated margin percent in 2008 and 2007 increased due to strong comparable sales in most markets. Both years were negatively impacted by higher labor costs and 2008 was also negatively impacted by higher commodity costs. In Other Countries & Corporate, the Company-operated margin in 2007 benefited by about 100 basis points related to the discontinuation of depreciation on the assets in Latam from mid-April through July 2007. • Supplemental information regarding Company-operated restaurants We continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance, profits and returns. In most cases, franchising is the best way to achieve these goals, but as previously stated, Company-operated restaurants are also important to our success. We report results for Company-operated restaurants based on their sales, less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs. We report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues, less associated occupancy costs. For this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure, we do not specifically allocate selling, general & administrative expenses and other operating (income) expenses to Company-operated or franchised restaurants. Other operating items that relate to the Company-operated restaurants generally include gains on sales of restaurant businesses and write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements. We believe the following information about Company-operated restaurants in our most significant markets provides an additional perspective on this business. Management responsible for our Company-operated restaurants in these markets analyzes the Company-operated business on this basis to assess its performance. Management of the Company also considers this information when evaluating restaurant ownership mix, subject to other relevant considerations. The following tables seek to illustrate the two components of our Company-operated margins. The first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations, which we refer to below as “Store operating margin.” The second relates to the value of our Brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties. We refer to this component as “Brand/real estate margin.” Both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties, although rent and royalties for Company-operated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation. Rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales, and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of McDonald’s investment in the restaurant. Royalty rates may also vary by market. As shown in the following tables, in disaggregating the components of our Company-operated margins, certain costs with respect to Company-operated restaurants are reflected in Brand/real estate margin. Those costs consist of rent payable by McDonald’s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy & other operating expenses recorded on the Consolidated statement of income. Store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses, and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating Brand/real estate margin. While we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our Company-operated business, it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In particular, as noted above, we do not allocate selling, general & administrative expenses to our Company-operated business. However, we believe that a range of $40,000 to $50,000 per restaurant, on average, is a typical range of costs to support this business in the U.S. The actual costs in markets outside the U.S. will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market. These costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant. 20 Table of Contents U.S. Europe Dollars in millions 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2006 As reported Number of Company-operatedrestaurants at year end 1,782 2,090 2,104 2,024 2,177 2,253 Sales by Company-operated restaurants $ 4,636 $ 4,682 $ 4,410 $ 7,424 $ 6,817 $ 5,885 Company-operated margin $ 856 $ 876 $ 843 $ 1,340 $ 1,205 $ 960 Store operating margin Company-operated margin $ 856 $ 876 $ 843 $ 1,340 $ 1,205 $ 960 Plus: Outside rent expense(1) 74 82 82 254 248 229 Depreciation – buildings &leasehold improvements(1) 70 78 74 110 107 98 Less: Rent & royalties(2) (684 ) (691 ) (651 ) (1,435 ) (1,294 ) (1,099 ) Store operating margin $ 316 $ 345 $ 348 $ 269 $ 266 $ 188 Brand/real estate margin Rent & royalties(2) $ 684 $ 691 $ 651 $ 1,435 $ 1,294 $ 1,099 Less: Outside rent expense(1) (74 ) (82 ) (82 ) (254 ) (248 ) (229 ) Depreciation – buildings &leasehold improvements(1) (70 ) (78 ) (74 ) (110 ) (107 ) (98 ) Brand/real estate margin $ 540 $ 531 $ 495 $ 1,071 $ 939 $ 772 (1) Represents certain costs recorded as occupancy & other operating expenses on the Consolidated statement of income – rent payable by McDonald’s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements.

This adjustment is made to reflect expense in Store operating margin and income in Brand/real estate margin. Countries within Europe have varying economic profiles and a wide range of rent and royalty rates as a percentage of sales. Selling, general & administrative expenses Consolidated selling, general & administrative expenses were flat (decreased 1% in constant currencies) in 2008 and increased 3% (flat in constant currencies) in 2007. The 2008 constant currency change benefited by 3 percentage points due to the 2007 Latam transaction. In 2008, expenses included costs related to the Beijing Summer Olympics and the Company’s biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention. In 2007, higher employee-related costs were offset by a reduction in costs due to the Latam transaction.

Selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales were 3.3% in 2008 compared with 3.7% in 2007 and 4.0% in 2006. Management believes that analyzing selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales, as well as revenues, is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support Systemwide restaurants. 21 Table of Contents Impairment and other charges, net On a pretax basis, the Company recorded impairment and other charges, net of $6 million in 2008, $1.7 billion in 2007 and $134 million in 2006.

In 2008, the charges primarily related to market restructuring costs in Greece. In 2007, the Company recorded $1.7 billion of pretax impairment charges primarily related to the Company’s sale of its Latam businesses to a developmental licensee organization. In addition, the Company recorded a $16 million write-off of assets associated with the Toasted Deli Sandwich products in Canada and a net gain of $14 million as a result of the transfer of the Company’s ownership interest in three European markets to a developmental licensee, partly offset by a loss on the transfer of a small market in Europe to a developmental licensee. In 2006, the charges primarily related to losses of $36 million incurred on the transfers of the Company’s ownership interest in certain markets, primarily in APMEA and Europe, to developmental licensees, costs of $35 million related to the closing of certain restaurants in the U.K. in conjunction with an overall restaurant portfolio review, costs of $29 million to buy out certain litigating franchisees in Brazil, asset write-offs and other charges in APMEA of $18 million, and a loss of $13 million related to the decision to dispose of supply chain operations in Russia.

The Company’s purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business. The Company realized higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses in 2008 and 2007 primarily as a result of selling more Company-operated restaurants in connection with our refranchising strategy in the Company’s major markets. • Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates Unconsolidated affiliates and partnerships are businesses in which the Company actively participates but does not control. The Company records equity in earnings from these entities representing McDonald’s share of results. For foreign affiliated markets – primarily Japan – results are reported after interest expense and income taxes. McDonald’s share of results for partnerships in certain consolidated markets such as the U.S. are reported before income taxes. These partnership restaurants are operated under conventional franchise arrangements and are included in conventional franchised restaurant counts. Results in 2008 and 2007 reflected improved results from our Japanese affiliate. • Asset dispositions and other expense Asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for store closings, contingencies and uncollectible receivables, and other miscellaneous expenses. Asset dispositions in 2008 reflected lower losses on restaurant closings and property disposals compared with 2007. In addition, 2008 results included income of $18 million due to the partial recovery of prior years’ sales taxes in the U.K. Results for 2006 reflected a gain of $26 million related to the sale of an office building in Russia. 22 Table of Contents Operating income Operating income Amount Increase/(decrease) Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation Dollars in millions 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2008 2007 U.S. $ 3,060 $ 2,842 $ 2,657 8 % 7 % 8 % 7 % Europe 2,608 2,125 1,610 23 32 17 21 APMEA 819 616 364 33 69 28 59 Other Countries & Corporate (44 ) (1,704 ) (198 ) 97 nm 97 nm Total $ 6,443 $ 3,879 $ 4,433 66 % (12 )% 62 % (18 )% Latam transaction (1,641 ) Total excluding Latam transaction* $ 6,443 $ 5,520 $ 4,433 17 % 25 % 14 % 19 % nm Not meaningful. * Results for 2007 included the impact of the Latam transaction in Other Countries & Corporate. This impact reflects an impairment charge of $1,665 million, partly offset by a benefit of $24 million due to eliminating depreciation on the assets in Latam in mid-April 2007. In order to provide management’s view of the underlying business performance, results are also shown excluding the impact of the Latam transaction. In the U.S., 2008 and 2007 results increased primarily due to higher franchised margin dollars. In 2007, operating income also included higher Company-operated restaurant margin dollars compared with 2006. In Europe, results for 2008 and 2007 were driven by strong performance in France, Russia and the U.K. as well as positive results in Germany and most other markets. Impairment and other charges, net in 2006 benefited the growth rate in 2007. In APMEA, results for 2008 were driven by strong results in Australia and China, and positive performance in most other markets. Results for 2007 were driven by improved results in China, Japan, Australia, Hong Kong and most other markets. • Combined operating margin Combined operating margin is defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues. Combined operating margin for 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 27.4%, 17.0% and 21.2%, respectively. Impairment and other charges negatively impacted the 2007 and 2006 combined operating margin by 7.4 percentage points and 0.7 percentage points, respectively. Interest expense Interest expense for 2008 increased primarily due to higher average debt levels, and to a lesser extent, higher average interest rates. Interest expense for 2007 increased primarily due to higher average interest rates and stronger foreign currencies, partly offset by lower average debt levels.

Translation and hedging activity primarily relates to net gains or losses on certain hedges that reduce the exposure to variability on certain intercompany foreign cash flow streams. Other expense primarily consists of gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt and minority interest. Interest income decreased for 2008 primarily due to lower average interest rates and average cash balances, while 2007 decreased primarily due to lower average cash balances. Gain on Sale of Investment In second quarter 2008, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in U.K.-based Pret A Manger. In connection with the sale, the Company received cash proceeds of $229 million and recognized a nonoperating pretax gain of $160 million ($109 million after tax). Provision for income taxes In 2008, 2007 and 2006, the reported effective income tax rates were 30.0%, 34.6%, and 31.0%, respectively. In 2007, the effective income tax rate was impacted by about 4 percentage points as a result of the following items: • A negative impact due to a minimal tax benefit of $62 million related to the Latam impairment charge of $1,641 million. This benefit was minimal due to the Company’s inability to utilize most of the capital losses generated by this transaction in 2007. • A positive impact due to a benefit of $316 million resulting from the completion of an IRS examination, partly offset by $28 million of expense related to the impact of a tax law change in Canada. Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.4 billion in 2008 and 2007. Substantially all of the net tax assets arose in the U.S. and other profitable markets. Discontinued operations The Company continues to focus its management and financial resources on the McDonald’s restaurant business as it believes the opportunities for long-term growth remain significant. Accordingly, during third quarter 2007, the Company sold its investment in Boston Market. In 2006, the Company disposed of its investment in Chipotle via public stock offerings in the first and second quarters and a tax-free exchange for McDonald’s common stock in the fourth quarter. As a result of the disposals during 2007 and 2006, both Boston Market’s and Chipotle’s results of operations and transaction gains are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. 23 Table of Contents In connection with the Company’s sale of its investment in Boston Market in August 2007, the Company received proceeds of approximately $250 million and recorded a gain of $69 million after tax. In addition, Boston Market’s net income (loss) for 2007 and 2006 was ($9) million and $7 million, respectively. In first quarter 2006, Chipotle completed an IPO of 6.1 million shares resulting in a tax-free gain to McDonald’s of $32 million to reflect an increase in the carrying value of the Company’s investment as a result of Chipotle selling shares in the public offering. Concurrent with the IPO, McDonald’s sold 3.0 million Chipotle shares, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $61 million and an additional gain of $14 million after tax. In second quarter 2006, McDonald’s sold an additional 4.5 million Chipotle shares, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $267 million and a gain of $128 million after tax, while still retaining majority ownership. In fourth quarter 2006, the Company completely separated from Chipotle through a noncash, tax-free exchange of its remaining Chipotle shares for its common stock. McDonald’s accepted 18.6 million shares of its common stock in exchange for the 16.5 million shares of Chipotle class B common stock held by McDonald’s and recorded a tax-free gain of $480 million. Chipotle’s net income for 2006 was $18 million. Accounting changes • SFAS Statement No. 158 In 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS No. 158). SFAS No. 158 requires the Company to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability on the Consolidated balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company adopted the applicable provisions of SFAS No. 158 effective December 31, 2006, as required. This resulted in a net decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income of $89 million, for a limited number of applicable international markets. • EITF Issue 06-2 In 2006, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 06-2, Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43, Accounting for Compensated Absences (EITF 06-2). Under EITF 06-2, compensation costs associated with a sabbatical should be accrued over the requisite service period, assuming certain conditions are met. Previously, the Company expensed sabbatical costs as incurred. The Company adopted EITF 06-2 effective January 1, 2007, as required and accordingly, recorded a $36 million cumulative adjustment, net of tax, to decrease the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. The annual impact to earnings is not significant. • FASB Interpretation No. 48 In 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which is an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007, as required. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company recorded a $20 million cumulative adjustment to increase the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. FIN 48 requires that a liability associated with an unrecognized tax benefit be classified as a long-term liability except for the amount for which cash payment is anticipated within one year. Upon adoption of FIN 48, $339 million of tax liabilities, net of deposits, were reclassified from current to long-term and included in other long-term liabilities. • SFAS Statement No. 157 In 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement does not require any new fair value measurements; rather, it applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157, as issued, were effective January 1, 2008. However, in February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which allows entities to defer the effective date of SFAS No. 157, for one year, for certain non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (i.e., at least annually). The Company adopted SFAS No. 157 as of January 1, 2008 and elected the deferral for non-financial assets and liabilities. The effect of adopting this standard was not significant, and we do not expect the January 1, 2009 adoption of SFAS No. 157 for non-financial assets and liabilities to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. • SFAS Statement No. 141(R) In 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141(R), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)). SFAS No. 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective acquisition-date fair values, changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from preacquisition contingencies, and requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred. SFAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. • SFAS Statement No. 160 In 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (ARB 51)) (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 becomes effective beginning January 1, 2009 and is required to be adopted prospectively, except for the reclassification of noncontrolling interests to equity and the recasting of net income (loss) attributable to both the controlling and noncontrolling interests, which are required to be 24 Table of Contents adopted retrospectively. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 160 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. CASH FLOWS The Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Cash provided by operations totaled $5.9 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $3.8 billion in 2008, while cash provided by operations totaled $4.9 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $2.9 billion in 2007. In 2008, cash provided by operations increased $1.0 billion or 21% compared to 2007 primarily due to increased operating results and changes in working capital, partly due to lower income tax payments and the receipt of $143 million related to an IRS examination completed in 2007. In 2007, cash provided by operations increased $535 million compared to 2006 primarily due to increased operating results and lower income tax payments. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.6 billion in 2008, an increase of $475 million compared with 2007. Proceeds from certain asset sales were lower in 2008 (Pret A Manger) than 2007 (Latam and Boston Market). In addition, capital expenditures increased $189 million in 2008, primarily driven by increases in Europe and APMEA, partly offset by the elimination of capital expenditures as a result of the Latam transaction. The increase in cash used for investing activities was partly offset by higher proceeds from the sales of restaurant businesses and property and lower expenditures on purchases of restaurant businesses in conjunction with our overall refranchising strategy. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.2 billion in 2007, a decrease of $124 million compared with 2006, primarily due to net proceeds received from the Latam transaction and the sale of Boston Market in 2007, partly offset by higher capital expenditures. Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.1 billion in 2008, an increase of $118 million compared with 2007. Financing activities in 2008 reflected lower proceeds from stock option exercises, mostly offset by higher net debt issuances. In 2007, cash used for financing activities totaled $4.0 billion, a decrease of $1.5 billion compared to 2006, primarily due to higher net debt issuances, partly offset by higher treasury stock purchases and an increase in the common stock dividend. As a result of the above activity, the Company’s cash and equivalents balance increased $82 million in 2008 to $2.1 billion, compared with a decrease of $147 million in 2007. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. Restaurant development and capital expenditures In 2008, the Company opened 918 traditional restaurants and 77 satellite restaurants (small, limited-menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 209 traditional restaurants and 196 satellite restaurants. In 2007, the Company opened 743 traditional restaurants and 93 satellite restaurants, and closed 240 traditional restaurants and 265 satellite restaurants. About 60% of restaurant openings and more than 75% of restaurant closings occurred in the major markets in both years.

In 2009, the Company expects to open about 950 traditional restaurants and 50 satellite restaurants and close about 200 traditional restaurants and 150 satellite restaurants. About 60% of total openings and 70% of total closings will be in major markets. Approximately 65% of Company-operated restaurants and about 80% of franchised restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2008. Franchisees operated 80% of the restaurants at year-end 2008. Capital expenditures increased $189 million or 10% in 2008 and $205 million or 12% in 2007. The increases in capital expenditures in both years were primarily due to higher investment in new restaurants — in Europe and APMEA in 2008 and in Europe and the U.S. in 2007. Capital expenditures reflected the Company’s commitment to growing sales at existing restaurants, including reinvestment initiatives such as reimaging in many markets around the world in both years and the Combined Beverage Business in the U.S. in 2008. Capital expenditures related to discontinued operations were $10 million and $82 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The expenditures in 2007 primarily related to investment in existing Boston Market restaurants and expenditures in 2006 primarily related to new Chipotle restaurants. Capital expenditures invested in major markets, excluding Japan, represented over 70% of the total in 2008, 2007 and 2006. Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts.

New restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long-term growth. Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies and leveraging best practices. In addition, foreign currency fluctuations affect average development costs. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonald’s restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $2.6 million in 2008. 25 Table of Contents The Company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2008 and 2007. Share repurchases and dividends For 2007 through 2009, the Company expects to return $15 billion to $17 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, subject to business and market conditions. In 2008, the Company returned $5.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid, bringing the two-year total returned to shareholders for 2007 and 2008 to $11.5 billion.

In September 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a $10 billion share repurchase program with no specified expiration date. In 2007 and 2008 combined, approximately 147 million shares have been repurchased for $7.9 billion, of which 97 million shares or $5.6 billion were purchased under this program. The Company reduced its shares outstanding at year end by over 4% compared with 2007, net of stock option exercises. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 33 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The Company’s Board of Directors decided that beginning in 2008, dividends declared will be paid on a quarterly basis, at the Board’s discretion. The 2008 full year dividend of $1.625 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.375 per share, with an increase to $0.50 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 33% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $2.00 per share annual dividend rate and reflects the Company’s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs. FINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Total assets and returns Total assets decreased $930 million or 3% in 2008. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total assets increased $784 million in 2008 primarily due to capital expenditures. Over 70% of total assets were in major markets at year-end 2008. Net property and equipment decreased $730 million in 2008 and represented about 70% of total assets at year end. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net property and equipment increased $681 million. Operating income is used to compute return on average assets, while income from continuing operations is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. Assets of discontinued operations are excluded from average assets since operating income excludes results from discontinued operations. Returns on assets and equity 2008 2007 2006 Return on average assets 21.8 % 13.2 % 15.0 % Return on average common equity 30.6 15.1 18.4 In 2008 and 2007, return on average assets and return on average common equity both benefited from strong operating results in the U.S., Europe and APMEA. During 2009, the Company will continue to concentrate restaurant openings and invest new capital in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long-term growth. Impairment and other charges reduced return on average assets by 5.4 percentage points and 0.4 percentage points in 2007 and 2006, respectively. In addition, impairment and other charges, partly offset by the 2007 net tax benefit resulting from the completion of an IRS examination, reduced return on average common equity by 8.5 percentage points and 0.6 percentage points in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating income, as reported, does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. The inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by 1.9 percentage points, 1.3 percentage points and 2.1 percentage points in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Financing and market risk The Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2008 totaled $10.2 billion, compared with $9.3 billion at December 31, 2007. The net increase in 2008 was primarily due to net issuances of $1.0 billion, partly offset by the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt of $155 million.

Fitch, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s currently rate, with a stable outlook, the Company’s commercial paper F1, A-1 and P-2, respectively; and its long-term debt A, A and A3, respectively. The Company’s key metrics for monitoring its credit structure are shown in the preceding table. While the Company targets these metrics for ease of focus, it also considers similar credit ratios that incorporate capitalized operating leases to estimate total adjusted debt. Total 26 Table of Contents adjusted debt, a term that is commonly used by the rating agencies referred to above, includes debt outstanding on the Company’s balance sheet plus an adjustment to capitalize operating leases. Based on their most recent calculations, these agencies add between $6 billion and $12 billion to debt for lease capitalization purposes, which increases total debt as a percent of total capitalization and reduces cash provided by operations as a percent of total debt for credit rating purposes. The Company believes the rating agency methodology for capitalizing leases requires certain adjustments. These adjustments include: excluding percent rents in excess of minimum rents; excluding certain Company-operated restaurant lease agreements outside the U.S. that are cancelable with minimal penalties (representing approximately 30% of Company-operated restaurant minimum rents outside the U.S., based on the Company’s estimate); capitalizing non-restaurant leases using a multiple of three times rent expense; and reducing total rent expense by a percentage of the annual minimum rent payments due to the Company from franchisees operating on leased sites. Based on this calculation, for credit analysis purposes, approximately $4 billion to $5 billion of future operating lease payments would be capitalized. Certain of the Company’s debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company’s business. Under existing authorization from the Company’s Board of Directors, at December 31, 2008, the Company has approximately $2.3 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) issuance of commercial paper; (iii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iv) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to registered debt securities on a U.S. shelf registration statement and a Euro Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $1.3 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement (see Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements). Debt maturing in 2009 is approximately $400 million of long-term corporate debt and $230 million of outstanding commercial paper. In 2009, the Company expects to issue commercial paper and long-term debt in order to refinance this maturing debt and potentially finance a portion of the Company’s previously disclosed 2007-2009 expectation to return $15 billion to $17 billion to shareholders. The Company also has $625 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings outstanding at year-end. Historically, the Company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt. Although the recent instability in the financial markets has resulted in constraints on available credit, the Company’s ability to raise funding in the long-term and short-term debt capital markets has not been adversely affected. In November 2008, the Company directly borrowed 40 billion Japanese Yen ($440 million) via a floating-rate syndicated term loan maturing in 2014. In January 2009, the Company issued $400 million of 10-year U.S. Dollar-denominated notes at a coupon rate of 5.0%, and $350 million of 30-year U.S. Dollar-denominated bonds at a coupon rate of 5.7%. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All exchange agreements are over-the-counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. Derivatives were recorded at fair value on the Company’s Consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008 as follows: miscellaneous other assets–$88 million; prepaid expenses and other current assets–$44 million; accrued payroll and other liabilities–$22 million; and other long-term liabilities (excluding accrued interest)–$4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company’s derivatives were recorded in miscellaneous other assets–$64 million and other long-term liabilities (excluding accrued interest)–$70 million. See Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments for additional information regarding their use and the impact of SFAS No. 133 regarding derivatives. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $4.5 billion and $6.1 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2008, neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position. The Company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Company’s largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures In millions of U.S. Dollars 2008 2007 Euro $ 4,551 $ 3,999 Australian Dollars 1,023 1,147 Canadian Dollars 795 929 British Pounds Sterling 785 634 Russian Ruble 407 463 The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the U.S. Based on the results of these analyses of the Company’s financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2008 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2008 levels would materially affect the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. 27 Table of Contents Contractual obligations and commitments The Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2008. See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

Debt obligations do not include $108 million of SFAS No. 133 noncash fair value adjustments because these adjustments have no impact on the obligation at maturity, as well as $174 million of accrued interest. The Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of IRS limitations. The investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market-rate investment alternatives under the Company’s qualified Profit Sharing and Savings Plan. Total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $390 million at December 31, 2008 and were primarily included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheet. Also included in other long-term liabilities at December 31, 2008 were gross unrecognized tax benefits of $272 million and liabilities for international retirement plans of $131 million. In connection with the Latam transaction, the Company has agreed to indemnify the buyers for certain tax and other claims, certain of which are reflected in other long-term liabilities on McDonald’s Consolidated balance sheet totaling $142 million at year-end 2008. OTHER MATTERS Critical accounting policies and estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions. The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity: • Property and equipment Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods. • Share-based compensation The Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, such as the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate and expected volatility of the Company’s stock over the expected life, which significantly impact the assumed fair value. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. • Long-lived assets impairment review Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Company’s long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Company’s experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. When the Company sells an existing business to a developmental licensee, it determines when these businesses are “held for sale” in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets. Impairment charges on assets held for sale are recognized when 28 Table of Contents management and, if required, the Company’s Board of Directors have approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal, the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than the assets’ net book value, among other factors. An impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the net book value of the business (including foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity) and the estimated cash sales price, less costs of disposal. An alternative accounting policy would be to recharacterize some or all of any loss as an intangible asset and amortize it to expense over future periods based on the term of the relevant licensing arrangement and as revenue is recognized for royalties and initial fees. Under this alternative for the 2007 Latam transaction, approximately $900 million of the $1.7 billion impairment charge could have been recharacterized as an intangible asset and amortized over the franchise term of 20 years, resulting in about $45 million of expense annually. This policy would be based on a view that the consideration for the sale consists of two components–the cash sales price and the future royalties and initial fees. The Company bases its accounting policy on management’s determination that royalties payable under its developmental license arrangements are substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements. The Company does not believe it would be appropriate to recognize an asset for the right to receive market-based fees in future periods, particularly given the continuing support and services provided to the licensees. Therefore, the Company believes that the recognition of an impairment charge based on the net cash sales price reflects the substance of the sale transaction. • Litigation accruals From time to time, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. • Income taxes The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. During 2008, the IRS examination of the Company’s 2005-2006 U.S. tax returns was completed. The tax provision impact associated with the completion of this examination was not significant. During 2007, the Company recorded a $316 million benefit as a result of the completion of an IRS examination of the Company’s 2003-2004 U.S. tax returns. The Company’s 2007 U.S. tax return is currently under examination and the completion of the examination, which will ultimately include the 2008 U.S. tax return, is expected in 2011. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $6.9 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If management’s intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. Effects of changing prices—inflation Although inflationary cost pressures increased globally in 2008, the Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. Reconciliation of returns on incremental invested capital Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Company’s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization, from the base period, adjusted for the impact of the Latam transaction in 2007. While the Company has converted certain other markets to a developmental license arrangement, management believes the Latam transaction and the associated charge are not indicative of ongoing operations due to the size and scope of the transaction. Management believes that the adjusted operating results better reflect the underlying business trends relevant to the periods presented. The denominator is the weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one- or three-year period. Adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less cash generated from investing activities related to the Boston Market, Chipotle, Latam and Pret A Manger transactions. The weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter’s investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2008 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2008 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2007 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full year impact on 2008 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2007 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average. 29 Table of Contents The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one-year and three-year ROIIC are as follows: One-year ROIIC calculation Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 Incremental change NUMERATOR: Operating income $ 6,442.9 $ 3,879.0 $ 2,563.9 Depreciation and amortization(1) 1,207.8 1,192.8 15.0 Latam transaction 1,665.3 (1,665.3 ) Currency translation(2) (180.7 ) Incremental adjusted operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates) $ 732.9 DENOMINATOR: Weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities(3) $ 1,911.9 Currency translation(2) (25.9 ) Weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates) $ 1,886.0 One-year ROIIC 38.9 % (1) Represents depreciation and amortization from continuing operations.

63908,MCD,MCDONALDS CORP,2010,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS The Company franchises and operates McDonald’s restaurants. Of the 32,478 restaurants in 117 countries at year-end 2009, 26,216 were operated by franchisees (including 19,020 operated by conventional franchisees, 3,160 operated by developmental licensees and 4,036 operated by foreign affiliated markets (affiliates)—primarily in Japan) and 6,262 were operated by the Company. Under our conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and décor of their restaurant businesses, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants. Under our developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market. We view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is important to delivering great, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. However, directly operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. In our Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced Systemwide. We continually review our mix of Company-operated and franchised (conventional franchised, developmental licensed and affiliated) restaurants to help maximize overall performance. The Company’s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and may include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. The business is managed as distinct geographic segments. Significant reportable segments include the United States (U.S.), Europe, and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA). In addition, throughout this report we present “Other Countries & Corporate” that includes operations in Canada and Latin America, as well as Corporate activities. The U.S., Europe and APMEA segments account for 35%, 41% and 19% of total revenues, respectively. France, Germany and the United Kingdom (U.K.), collectively, account for approximately 55% of Europe’s revenues; and Australia, China and Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), collectively, account for over 50% of APMEA’s revenues. These six markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as “major markets” throughout this report and comprise over 70% of total revenues. The Company continues to focus its management and financial resources on the McDonald’s restaurant business as we believe opportunities remain for long-term growth. Accordingly, in 2009, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in Redbox Automated Retail, LLC (Redbox) for total consideration of $140 million. In 2008, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in U.K.-based Pret A Manger for cash proceeds of $229 million. In connection with both sales, the Company recognized nonoperating gains. During 2007, the Company sold its investment in Boston Market. As a result of the disposal, Boston Market’s results of operations and transaction gain are reflected as discontinued operations. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had disposed of all non-McDonald’s restaurant businesses. In analyzing business trends, management considers a variety of performance and financial measures, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth, restaurant margins and returns. • Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because they believe this better represents the Company’s underlying business trends. • Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the Company’s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. McDonald’s reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays and weekend days in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts. The Company refers to these impacts as calendar shift/trading day adjustments. In addition, the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts. These impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have the greatest effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal. In 2008, there was an incremental full day of sales and guest counts due to leap year. • Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company’s financial performance because these sales are the 10 Table of Contents basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. • Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the adjusted cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation assumes a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The strength of the alignment between the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the System) has been key to McDonald’s success over the years. This business model enables McDonald’s to consistently deliver locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve. In addition, it facilitates our ability to identify, implement and scale innovative ideas that meet customers’ changing needs and preferences. McDonald’s customer-focused Plan to Win—which is centered around being better, not just bigger—provides a common framework for our global business yet allows for local adaptation. Through the execution of multiple initiatives surrounding the five key drivers of exceptional customer experiences—People, Products, Place, Price and Promotion—we have enhanced the restaurant experience for customers worldwide and grown sales and customer visits in each of the last six years. This Plan, coupled with financial discipline, has delivered strong results for shareholders. We have exceeded our long-term, constant currency financial targets of average annual Systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5%; average annual operating income growth of 6% to 7%; and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens every year since the Plan’s implementation in 2003, after adjusting 2007 for the Latin America developmental license transaction. Given the size and scope of our global business, we believe these financial targets are realistic and sustainable, while keeping us focused on making the best decisions for the long-term benefit of shareholders. In 2009, we continued to elevate the customer experience by remaining focused on the Company’s key global success factors of branded affordability, menu variety and beverage choice, convenience and daypart expansion, ongoing restaurant reinvestment and operations excellence. Locally-relevant initiatives around these factors successfully resonated with consumers driving increases in sales, customer visits and market share in many countries despite challenging global economies and a contracting informal eating out market. As a result, each reportable segment contributed to 2009 global comparable sales and guest counts, which increased 3.8% and 1.4%, respectively. In the U.S., we grew sales and market share with comparable sales up for the 7th consecutive year, rising 2.6% in 2009. This performance was the result of a continued focus on classic menu favorites such as the Big Mac and Quarter Pounder, increased emphasis on everyday affordability, and the national marketing launch of the new McCafé premium coffees and premium Angus Third Pounder. Complementing these efforts were our strategies related to convenient locations, extended hours, efficient drive-thru service and value-oriented local beverage promotions. In conjunction with the introduction of the McCafé premium coffees, reinvestment was needed in many restaurants to accommodate the new equipment required to prepare these beverages as well as facilitate the national introduction of smoothies and frappés in mid-2010. In most cases, this reinvestment involved expanding and optimizing the efficiency of the drive-thru booth, enabling us to better serve even more customers faster. In Europe, comparable sales rose 5.2%, marking the 6th consecutive year of comparable sales increases. This performance reflected Europe’s strategic priorities to upgrade the customer and employee experience, enhance local relevance, and build brand transparency. Initiatives surrounding these priorities encompassed: leveraging our tiered menu featuring locally relevant selections of premium, classic core and everyday affordable menu offerings as well as dessert and limited-time food promotions; and reimaging nearly 900 restaurants including adding about 290 McCafés—an upscale area with coffeehouse-style ambiance inside an existing McDonald’s restaurant. In addition, we addressed growing interest in portable snack offerings with platforms such as the Little Tasters in the U.K., launched breakfast in Germany and increased our convenience with extended hours. In order to support greater menu variety, we completed the roll-out of a new more efficient kitchen operating system in substantially all of our European restaurants. Finally, we enhanced customer trust in our brand through communications that emphasized the quality and origin of McDonald’s food and our sustainable business practices. In APMEA, we continued to execute our four growth platforms of breakfast, convenience, core menu and value. Comparable sales rose 3.4% primarily due to the ongoing momentum of our business in Australia where multiple initiatives surrounding menu variety including the launch of the premium Angus burger, greater convenience and reimaging further strengthened our brand relevance. In addition, across the segment, we enhanced our convenience by increasing the number of restaurants open 24-hours to over 4,600, expanding delivery service to more than 1,300 locations including about 300 in China, and enhancing drive-thru efficiency. We sustained the momentum of our breakfast business, currently in about 75% of our restaurants, by increasing customer awareness and visit frequency with the launch of premium roast coffee in key markets like Japan and China and promoting it through successful sampling programs. We continued to appeal to customers with branded affordability menus, especially our value lunch platforms, and highlighted classic menu favorites like the Quarter Pounder. Our customer-centered strategies seek to optimize price, product mix and promotion as a means to drive sales and profits. This approach is complemented by a focus on driving operating efficiencies and effectively managing restaurant-level costs by leveraging our scale, supply chain infrastructure and risk management practices. Our ability to successfully execute our strategies in every area of the world contributed to improved profitability as measured by combined operating margin of 30.1% in 2009, an improvement of 2.7 percentage points over 2008. Strong global performance positively impacted cash from operations, which totaled $5.8 billion in 2009. Our substantial cash flow, strong credit rating and continued access to credit provide us significant flexibility to fund capital expenditures as well as return cash to shareholders. About $2.0 billion of cash 11 Table of Contents from operations was invested in our business primarily to open 868 restaurants (511 net, after 357 closings) and reimage about 1,850 existing locations. After these capital expenditures, we returned our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In 2009, we returned $5.1 billion consisting of $2.2 billion in dividends and $2.9 billion in share repurchases. This brought the total return to shareholders to $16.6 billion under our $15 billion to $17 billion target for 2007 through 2009. Cash from operations continues to benefit from our evolution toward a more heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income received from owner/operators is a very stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs, and is less capital-intensive. In addition, we believe locally-owned and operated restaurants help us maximize brand performance and are at the core of our competitive advantage, making McDonald’s not just a global brand but also a locally-relevant one. To that end, for 2008 and 2009 combined, we refranchised about 1,100 restaurants, increasing the percent of restaurants franchised worldwide to 81%. Refranchising impacts our consolidated financial statements as follows: • Consolidated revenues are initially reduced because we collect rent and royalty as a percent of sales from a refranchised restaurant instead of 100% of its sales. • Company-operated margin dollars decline while franchised margin dollars increase. • Margin percentages are affected depending on the sales and cost structures of the restaurants refranchised. • Other operating (income) expense fluctuates as we recognize gains and/or losses resulting from sales of restaurants. • Combined operating margin percent improves. • Return on average assets increases primarily due to a decrease in average asset balances. HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE YEAR INCLUDED: • Comparable sales grew 3.8% and guest counts rose 1.4%, building on 2008 increases of 6.9% and 3.1%, respectively. • Growth in combined operating margin of 2.7 percentage points from 27.4% in 2008 to 30.1% in 2009. • Operating income increased 6% (10% in constant currencies). • Net income per share was $4.11, an increase of 9% (13% in constant currencies). • Cash provided by operations totaled $5.8 billion. • The Company increased the quarterly cash dividend per share 10% to $0.55 for the fourth quarter–bringing the current annual dividend rate to $2.20 per share. • One-year ROIIC was 38.0% and three-year ROIIC was 42.9% for the period ended December 31, 2009. OUTLOOK FOR 2010 We will continue to drive success in 2010 and beyond by remaining focused on our “better, not just bigger” strategy and the key drivers of exceptional customer experiences—People, Products, Place, Price and Promotion. Our global System is energized by our ongoing momentum, strong competitive position and growth opportunities. We intend to further differentiate our brand, increase customer visits and grow market share by pursuing initiatives in three key areas: service enhancement, restaurant reimaging and menu innovation. These efforts will include leveraging technology to make it easier for restaurant staff to quickly and accurately serve customers, accelerating our interior and exterior reimaging efforts and innovating at every tier of our menu to deliver great taste and value to customers. As we execute along these priorities and remain disciplined in operations and financial management, we expect to increase McDonald’s brand relevance, widen our competitive lead and, in turn, grow sales, profits and returns. As we do so, we are confident we can meet or exceed the long-term constant currency financial targets previously discussed despite expectations for a continued challenging global economic environment in 2010. In the U.S., our strategies include strengthening our core menu and value offerings, aggressively pursuing new growth opportunities in chicken, breakfast, beverages and snacking options, and elevating the brand experience. Our initiatives include highlighting the enduring appeal of core menu classics such as the Big Mac, emphasizing the value our menu offers all-day-long including the new breakfast value menu, and encouraging the trial of new products with the Mac Snack Wrap and—by mid-year—frappés and smoothies. In addition, our plans to elevate the brand experience encompass updating our technology with a new point of sale system, enhancing restaurant manager and crew retention and productivity, and initiating a multi-year program to contemporize the interiors and exteriors of our restaurants through reimaging, completing about 500 in 2010. These efforts combined with the convenience of our locations, optimized drive-thru service, free wireless service and longer operating hours will further reinforce McDonald’s position as an easy, enjoyable eating-out experience. Our plans for Europe are focused on building market share as we continue to execute along Europe’s three key priorities. This includes upgrading our restaurant ambiance by reimaging approximately 1,000 restaurants, primarily in France and the U.K., as we make progress toward our goal to reimage more than 85% of our restaurants by the end of 2011. In addition, we expect to leverage technologies such as self-order kiosks, hand-held order devices and drive-thru customer order displays to enhance the customer experience and help speed service. We will further enhance our local relevance by complementing our tiered-menu with limited-time food events as well as new snack and dessert options. Finally, we will remain approachable and accessible as we continue to educate consumers about the quality and origin of our food and communicate our sustainable business practices. In APMEA, we will execute initiatives that best support our goal to be customers’ first choice for eating out: convenience, core menu, branded affordability, improved operations and reimaging. Our convenience initiatives include leveraging the success of 24-hour or extended operating hours, expanding delivery service and building drive-thru traffic. At the same time, we will continue to elevate the role of our classic core and breakfast menus, complementing both with locally-relevant food news. We will maximize the impact of our everyday affordability platforms with mid-tier and value lunch programs and intensify our focus on operations to drive efficiencies. In addition, we will accelerate our reimaging efforts using a set of standard interior and exterior designs. Finally, given its size and long-term 12 Table of Contents potential, we will continue to aggressively open new restaurants in China with a goal of opening about 600 restaurants over the next three years. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize our mix of Company-operated and franchised restaurants and expect to refranchise restaurants when and where appropriate. As previously discussed, our evolution toward a more heavily franchised, less capital-intensive business model has favorable implications for the strength and stability of our cash flow, the amount of capital we invest and long-term returns. As a result, we expect free cash flow—cash from operations less capital expenditures—will continue to grow in the future. We remain committed to returning all this cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases over the long term. We will remain disciplined financially as we seek to maximize the impact of all of our spending from selling, general & administrative expenses to capital expenditures. In making capital allocation decisions, our goal is to elevate the McDonald’s experience to drive sustainable growth in sales and market share while earning strong returns. To that end, about half of the $2.4 billion of planned 2010 capital expenditures will be invested to reimage existing restaurants with the other half primarily used to build new locations. McDonald’s does not provide specific guidance on net income per share. The following information is provided to assist in analyzing the Company’s results: • Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add nearly 2 percentage points to 2010 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies), most of which will be due to the 609 net traditional restaurants added in 2009. • The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point increase in comparable sales for either the U.S. or Europe would increase annual net income per share by about 3 cents. • With about 75% of McDonald’s grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Company’s commodity costs. For the full year 2010, the total basket of goods cost is expected to be relatively flat in the U.S. and Europe. Some volatility may be experienced between quarters in the normal course of business, with more favorable comparisons in the first half of the year. • The Company expects full-year 2010 selling, general & administrative expenses to be relatively flat, in constant currencies, although fluctuations will be experienced between quarters due to certain items in 2010 such as the Vancouver Winter Olympics and the biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention in April. • Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense in 2010 to increase slightly compared with 2009. • A significant part of the Company’s operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 45% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 70% of the Company’s operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction compared with 2009, the Company’s annual net income per share would change by about 17 to 19 cents. At current foreign currency rates, the Company expects foreign currency translation to positively impact full year 2010 revenues and net income per share, with most of the benefit occurring in the first half of the year. • The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2010 to be approximately 29% to 31%. Some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate that is outside the annual range. • McDonald’s Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate) announced plans to close approximately 430 restaurants over the next 12-18 months in conjunction with the strategic review of the market’s real estate portfolio. These actions are designed to enhance the customer experience, overall profitability and returns of the market. As a result of these closures, McDonald’s Corporation expects to record after tax impairment charges totaling approximately $40 million to $50 million, primarily in the first half of the year. • The Company expects capital expenditures for 2010 to be approximately $2.4 billion. About half of this amount will be reinvested in existing restaurants, including the reimaging of over 2,000 locations worldwide. The rest will primarily be used to open about 1,000 restaurants (975 traditional and 25 satellites). These restaurant numbers include new unit openings (about 350 restaurants) in affiliated and developmental licensed markets, such as Japan and Latin America, where the Company does not fund any capital expenditures. The Company expects net additions of about 325 restaurants (475 net traditional additions and 150 net satellite closings), which reflect the McDonald’s Japan closings. 13 Table of Contents Consolidated Operating Results Operating results 2009 2008 2007 Dollars in millions, except per share data Amount Increase/ (decrease) Amount Increase/ (decrease) Amount Revenues Sales by Company-operated restaurants $ 15,459 (7 )% $ 16,561 — % $ 16,611 Revenues from franchised restaurants 7,286 5 6,961 13 6,176 Total revenues 22,745 (3 ) 23,522 3 22,787 Operating costs and expenses Company-operated restaurant expenses 12,651 (7 ) 13,653 (1 ) 13,742 Franchised restaurants—occupancy expenses 1,302 6 1,230 8 1,140 Selling, general & administrative expenses 2,234 (5 ) 2,355 — 2,367 Impairment and other charges (credits), net (61 ) nm 6 nm 1,670 Other operating (income) expense, net (222 ) (35 ) (165 ) nm (11 ) Total operating costs and expenses 15,904 (7 ) 17,079 (10 ) 18,908 Operating income 6,841 6 6,443 66 3,879 Interest expense 473 (9 ) 523 27 410 Nonoperating (income) expense, net (24 ) 69 (78 ) 25 (103 ) Gain on sale of investment (95 ) 41 (160 ) nm Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes 6,487 5 6,158 72 3,572 Provision for income taxes 1,936 5 1,845 49 1,237 Income from continuing operations 4,551 6 4,313 85 2,335 Income from discontinued operations (net of taxes of $35) 60 Net income $ 4,551 6 % $ 4,313 80 % $ 2,395 Income per common share—diluted Continuing operations $ 4.11 9 % $ 3.76 95 % $ 1.93 Discontinued operations 0.05 Net income $ 4.11 9 % $ 3.76 90 % $ 1.98 Weighted-average common shares outstanding—diluted 1,107.4 1,146.0 1,211.8 nm Not meaningful. In August 2007, the Company completed the sale of its businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and 13 other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, which totaled 1,571 restaurants, to a developmental licensee organization. The Company refers to these markets as “Latam.” As a result of the Latam transaction, the Company receives royalties in these markets instead of a combination of Company-operated sales and franchised rents and royalties. Based on approval by the Company’s Board of Directors on April 17, 2007, the Company concluded Latam was “held for sale” as of that date in accordance with guidance on the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.7 billion in 2007, substantially all of which was noncash. The charge included $896 million for the difference between the net book value of the Latam business and approximately $675 million in cash proceeds received. This loss in value was primarily due to a historically difficult economic environment coupled with volatility experienced in many of the markets included in this transaction. The charges also included historical foreign currency translation losses of $769 million recorded in shareholders’ equity. The Company recorded a tax benefit of $62 million in 2007 in connection with this transaction. As a result of meeting the “held for sale” criteria, the Company ceased recording depreciation expense with respect to Latam effective April 17, 2007. In connection with the sale, the Company agreed to indemnify the buyers for certain tax and other claims, certain of which are reflected as liabilities on McDonald’s Consolidated balance sheet, totaling $97 million at December 31, 2009 and $142 million at December 31, 2008. The change in the balance was primarily a result of the resolution of certain of these liabilities as well as the impact of foreign currency translation. The Company mitigates the currency impact to income of these foreign currency denominated liabilities through the use of forward foreign exchange agreements. The buyers of the Company’s operations in Latam entered into a 20-year master franchise agreement that requires the buyers, among other obligations to (i) pay monthly royalties commencing at a rate of approximately 5% of gross sales of the restaurants in these markets, substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements; (ii) commit to adding approximately 150 new McDonald’s restaurants by the end of 2010 and pay an initial fee for each new restaurant opened; and (iii) commit to specified annual capital expenditures for existing restaurants. 14 Table of Contents In addition to the consolidated operating results shown on the previous page, consolidated results for 2007 and adjusted growth rates for 2008 are presented in the following table excluding the impact of the Latam transaction. These results include the effect of foreign currency translation further discussed in the section titled Impact of foreign currency translation on reported results. While the Company has converted certain other markets to a developmental license arrangement, management believes the Latam transaction and the associated charge are not indicative of ongoing operations due to the size and scope of the transaction. Management believes that the adjusted operating results better reflect the underlying business trends relevant to the periods presented.

(1) The results for the full year 2007 included impairment and other charges of $1,665 million, partly offset by a benefit of $24 million due to eliminating depreciation on the assets in Latam in mid-April 2007, and a tax benefit of $62 million. (2) The following items impact the comparison of growth in diluted income per share from continuing operations and diluted net income per share for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared with 2008. On a net basis, these items positively impact the comparison by 1 percentage point: 2009 • $0.08 per share after tax income primarily due to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latam transaction. • $0.05 per share after tax gain on the sale of the Company’s minority ownership interest in Redbox. 2008 • $0.09 per share after tax gain on the sale of the Company’s minority ownership interest in Pret A Manger. (3) The following items impact the comparison of adjusted growth in diluted income per share from continuing operations and diluted net income per share for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared with 2007. On a net basis, these items negatively impact the comparison by 7 and 6 percentage points, respectively: 2008 • $0.09 per share after tax gain on the sale of the Company’s minority ownership interest in Pret A Manger. 2007 • $0.26 per share of income tax benefit resulting from the completion of an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination of the Company’s 2003-2004 U.S. federal income tax returns; partly offset by • $0.02 per share of income tax expense related to the impact of a tax law change in Canada. NET INCOME AND DILUTED NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE In 2009, net income and diluted net income per common share were $4.6 billion and $4.11. Results benefited by after tax income of $87 million or $0.08 per share primarily due to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latam transaction. Results also benefited by an after tax gain of $59 million or $0.05 per share due to the sale of the Company’s minority ownership interest in Redbox. Results were negatively impacted by $0.15 per share due to the effect of foreign currency translation. In 2008, net income and diluted net income per common share were $4.3 billion and $3.76. Results benefited by a $109 million or $0.09 per share after tax gain on the sale of the Company’s minority ownership interest in Pret A Manger. Results also benefited by $0.09 per share due to the effect of foreign currency translation. In 2007, net income and diluted net income per common share were $2.4 billion and $1.98. Income from continuing operations was $2.3 billion or $1.93 per share, which included $1.6 billion or $1.30 per share of net expense related to the Latam transaction. This reflects an impairment charge of $1.32 per share, partly offset by a $0.02 per share benefit due to eliminating depreciation on the assets in Latam in mid-April 2007 in accordance with accounting rules. In addition, 2007 results included a net tax benefit of $288 million or $0.24 per share resulting from the completion of an IRS examination of the Company’s 2003-2004 U.S. federal income tax returns, partly offset by the impact of a tax law change in Canada. Income from discontinued operations was $60 million or $0.05 per share. The Company repurchased 50.3 million shares of its stock for $2.9 billion in 2009 and 69.7 million shares for $4.0 billion in 2008, driving reductions of over 3% and 4% of total shares outstanding, respectively, net of stock option exercises. IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS While changing foreign currencies affect reported results, McDonald’s mitigates exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows, and purchasing goods and services in local currencies. In 2009, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results, primarily driven by the Euro, British Pound, Russian Ruble, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. In 2008, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results, driven by the stronger Euro and most other currencies, partly offset by the weaker British Pound. In 2007, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results, primarily driven by the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. 15 Table of Contents Impact of foreign currency translation on reported results Reported amount Currency translation benefit/(cost) In millions, except per share data 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 Revenues $ 22,745 $ 23,522 $ 22,787 $ (1,340 ) $ 441 $ 988 Company-operated margins 2,807 2,908 2,869 (178 ) 63 129 Franchised margins 5,985 5,731 5,036 (176 ) 120 179 Selling, general & administrative expenses 2,234 2,355 2,367 75 (21 ) (73 ) Operating income 6,841 6,443 3,879 (273 ) 163 230 Income from continuing operations 4,551 4,313 2,335 (164 ) 103 138 Net income 4,551 4,313 2,395 (164 ) 103 138 Income from continuing operations per common share—diluted 4.11 3.76 1.93 (.15 ) .09 .12 Net income per common share—diluted 4.11 3.76 1.98 (.15 ) .09 .12 REVENUES The Company’s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. The Company continues to optimize its restaurant ownership mix, cash flow and returns through its refranchising strategy. For the full years 2008 and 2009 combined, the Company refranchised about 1,100 restaurants, primarily in its major markets. The shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants negatively impacts consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales shift to franchised sales, where the Company receives rent and/or royalties based on a percent of sales. In 2009, constant currency revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales and expansion, partly offset by the impact of the refranchising strategy in certain of the Company’s major markets. As a result of the refranchising strategy, franchised restaurants represent 81%, 80% and 78% of Systemwide restaurants at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In 2008, constant currency revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales, partly offset by the refranchising strategy and the impact of the Latam transaction. Upon completion of the Latam transaction in August 2007, the Company receives royalties based on a percent of sales in these markets instead of a combination of Company-operated sales and franchised rents and royalties.

In addition, our market-leading breakfast business contributed to revenue growth in 2008. New products introduced in 2009 included McCafé premium coffees and the Angus Third Pounder, while new products introduced in 2008 included Southern Style Chicken products, Iced Coffee and Sweet Tea. The refranchising strategy negatively impacted revenue growth in both years. Europe’s constant currency increases in revenues in 2009 and 2008 were primarily driven by comparable sales increases in the U.K., France and Russia (which is entirely Company-operated) as well as expansion in Russia. In both years, these increases were partly offset by the impact of the refranchising strategy, primarily in the U.K. and Germany. In APMEA, the constant currency increase in revenues in 2009 was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in Australia and most other Asian markets, partly offset by negative comparable sales in China. The 2008 increase was primarily driven by strong comparable sales in Australia and China, as well as positive comparable sales throughout the segment. In addition, expansion in China contributed to the increases in both years. In Other Countries & Corporate, Company-operated sales declined in 2008 while franchised revenues increased primarily as a result of the Latam transaction in August 2007. Revenues in both years were negatively impacted by the refranchising strategy in Canada.

Franchised margin dollars represented nearly 70% of the combined restaurant margins in 2009 and about 65% of the combined restaurant margins in 2008 and 2007. Franchised margin dollars increased $254 million or 4% (7% in constant currencies) in 2009 and $695 million or 14% (11% in constant currencies) in 2008. The refranchising strategy contributed to the growth in franchised margin dollars in both 2009 and 2008 and the August 2007 Latam transaction contributed to the growth in 2008.

The 2008 increase was primarily driven by positive comparable sales, partly offset by the refranchising strategy. Europe’s franchised margin percent decreased in 2009 as positive comparable sales were offset by higher occupancy expenses, the refranchising strategy and the cost of strategic brand and sales building initiatives. The 2008 increase was primarily due to strong comparable sales in most markets, partly offset by the impact of the refranchising strategy, higher rent expense and the cost of strategic brand and sales building initiatives. In APMEA, the franchised margin percent increase in 2008 was primarily driven by positive comparable sales. In Other Countries & Corporate, the franchised margin percent increased in 2008 as a result of the 2007 Latam transaction. The franchised margin percent in APMEA and, beginning in 2008, Other Countries & Corporate is higher relative to the U.S. and Europe due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed and/or affiliated restaurants where the Company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs. • Company-operated margins Company-operated margin dollars represent sales by Company-operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. Company-operated margin dollars decreased $101 million or 3% (increased 3% in constant currencies) in 2009 and increased $39 million or 1% (decreased 1% in constant currencies) in 2008. After the Latam transaction in August 2007, there are no Company-operated restaurants remaining in Latin America. Company-operated margin dollars were negatively impacted by this transaction in 2008 and 2007 and by the refranchising strategy in 2009 and 2008. The refranchising strategy had a positive impact on the margin percent in 2009 and 2008, primarily in the U.S. and Europe. 17 Table of Contents Company-operated margins In millions 2009 2008 2007 U.S. $ 832 $ 856 $ 876 Europe 1,240 1,340 1,205 APMEA 624 584 471 Other Countries & Corporate 111 128 317 Total $ 2,807 $ 2,908 $ 2,869 Percent of sales U.S. 19.4 % 18.5 % 18.7 % Europe 18.4 18.0 17.7 APMEA 16.8 15.9 15.0 Other Countries & Corporate 15.2 15.3 16.1 Total 18.2 % 17.6 % 17.3 % In the U.S., the Company-operated margin percent increased in 2009 due to positive comparable sales and the impact of the refranchising strategy, partly offset by additional depreciation related to the beverage initiative and higher commodity costs. The margin percent decreased in 2008 due to cost pressures including higher commodity and labor costs, partly offset by positive comparable sales. Europe’s Company-operated margin percent increased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher commodity and labor costs. In 2009, local inflation and the impact of weaker currencies on the cost of certain imported products drove higher costs, primarily in Russia, and negatively impacted the Company-operated margin percent. In APMEA, the Company-operated margin percent in 2009 and 2008 increased due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor costs. The margin percent in 2008 was also negatively impacted by higher commodity costs. In Other Countries & Corporate, the Company-operated margin in 2007 benefited by about 100 basis points related to the discontinuation of depreciation on the assets in Latam from mid-April through July 2007. • Supplemental information regarding Company-operated restaurants We continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance, profits and returns. In most cases, franchising is the best way to achieve these goals, but as previously stated, Company-operated restaurants are also important to our success. We report results for Company-operated restaurants based on their sales, less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs. We report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues, less associated occupancy costs. For this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure, we do not specifically allocate selling, general & administrative expenses and other operating (income) expenses to Company-operated or franchised restaurants. Other operating items that relate to the Company-operated restaurants generally include gains/losses on sales of restaurant businesses and write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements. We believe the following information about Company-operated restaurants in our most significant markets provides an additional perspective on this business. Management responsible for our Company-operated restaurants in these markets analyzes the Company-operated business on this basis to assess its performance. Management of the Company also considers this information when evaluating restaurant ownership mix, subject to other relevant considerations. The following tables seek to illustrate the two components of our Company-operated margins. The first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations, which we refer to as “Store operating margin.” The second relates to the value of our Brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties. We refer to this component as “Brand/real estate margin.” Both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties, although rent and royalties for Company-operated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation. Rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales, and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of McDonald’s investment in the restaurant. Royalty rates may also vary by market. As shown in the following tables, in disaggregating the components of our Company-operated margins, certain costs with respect to Company-operated restaurants are reflected in Brand/real estate margin. Those costs consist of rent payable by McDonald’s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy & other operating expenses recorded in the Consolidated statement of income. Store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses, and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating Brand/real estate margin. 18 Table of Contents While we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our Company-operated business, it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In particular, as noted previously, we do not allocate selling, general & administrative expenses to our Company-operated business. However, we believe that a range of $40,000 to $50,000 per restaurant, on average, is a typical range of costs to support this business in the U.S. The actual costs in markets outside the U.S. will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market. These costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant.

This adjustment is made to reflect these occupancy costs in Brand/real estate margin. The relative percentage of sites that are owned versus leased varies by country. (2) Reflects average Company–operated rent and royalties (as a percentage of 2009 sales: U.S. – 14.8% and Europe – 19.4%). This adjustment is made to reflect expense in Store operating margin and income in Brand/real estate margin. Countries within Europe have varying economic profiles and a wide range of rent and royalty rates as a percentage of sales. SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Consolidated selling, general & administrative expenses decreased 5% (2% in constant currencies) in 2009 and were flat (decreased 1% in constant currencies) in 2008. In 2008, expenses included costs related to the Beijing Summer Olympics and the Company’s biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention. The 2008 constant currency change benefited by 3 percentage points due to the 2007 Latam transaction.

Selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales were 3.1% in 2009 compared with 3.3% in 2008 and 3.7% in 2007. Management believes that analyzing selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales, as well as revenues, is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support Systemwide restaurants. 19 Table of Contents IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER CHARGES (CREDITS), NET On a pretax basis, the Company recorded impairment and other charges (credits), net of ($61) million in 2009, $6 million in 2008 and $1.7 billion in 2007.

The Company also recognized a tax benefit in 2009 in connection with this income, mainly related to the release of a tax valuation allowance. In 2007, the Company recorded $1.7 billion of pretax impairment charges related to the Company’s sale of its Latam businesses to a developmental licensee organization. OTHER OPERATING (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET Other operating (income) expense, net In millions 2009 2008 2007 Gains on sales of restaurant businesses $ (113 ) $ (126 ) $ (89 ) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates (168 ) (111 ) (116 ) Asset dispositions and other expense 59 72 194 Total $ (222 ) $ (165 ) $ (11 ) • Gains on sales of restaurant businesses Gains on sales of restaurant businesses include gains from sales of Company-operated restaurants as well as gains from exercises of purchase options by franchisees with business facilities lease arrangements (arrangements where the Company leases the businesses, including equipment, to franchisees who generally have options to purchase the businesses). The Company’s purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business. The Company realized higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses in 2009 and 2008 compared with 2007 primarily as a result of selling more Company-operated restaurants in connection with the refranchising strategy in the Company’s major markets. • Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates Unconsolidated affiliates and partnerships are businesses in which the Company actively participates but does not control. The Company records equity in earnings from these entities representing McDonald’s share of results. For foreign affiliated markets – primarily Japan – results are reported after interest expense and income taxes. McDonald’s share of results for partnerships in certain consolidated markets such as the U.S. are reported before income taxes. These partnership restaurants are operated under conventional franchise arrangements and, therefore, are classified as conventional franchised restaurants. Results in 2009 and 2008 reflected improved results from our Japanese affiliate. 2009 results also benefited from the stronger Japanese Yen. • Asset dispositions and other expense Asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for store closings, uncollectible receivables and other miscellaneous income and expenses. Asset dispositions in 2009 and 2008 reflected lower losses on restaurant closings and property disposals compared with 2007. 20 Table of Contents OPERATING INCOME Operating income Amount Increase/(decrease) Increase excluding currency translation Dollars in millions 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2009 2008 U.S. $ 3,232 $ 3,060 $ 2,842 6 % 8 % 6 % 8 % Europe 2,588 2,608 2,125 (1 ) 23 8 17 APMEA 989 819 616 21 33 23 28 Other Countries & Corporate 32 (44 ) (1,704 ) nm 97 nm 97 Total $ 6,841 $ 6,443 $ 3,879 6 % 66 % 10 % 62 % Latam transaction (1,641 ) Total excluding Latam transaction* $ 6,841 $ 6,443 $ 5,520 6 % 17 % 10 % 14 % nm Not meaningful. * Results for 2007 included the impact of the Latam transaction in Other Countries & Corporate. This impact reflects an impairment charge of $1,665 million, partly offset by a benefit of $24 million due to eliminating depreciation on the assets in Latam in mid-April 2007. In order to provide management’s view of the underlying business performance, results are also shown excluding the impact of the Latam transaction. Results for 2009 included $65 million of income in Other Countries & Corporate primarily related to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latam transaction. This benefit positively impacted the growth in total operating income by 1 percentage point. In the U.S., 2009 and 2008 results increased primarily due to higher franchised margin dollars. In Europe, results for 2009 and 2008 were driven by strong performance in France, the U.K. and Russia. Positive results in Germany and most other markets also contributed to the operating income increase in 2008. In APMEA, results for 2009 were driven primarily by strong results in Australia and expansion in China. Results for 2008 were driven by strong results in Australia and China, and positive performance in most other markets. • Combined operating margin Combined operating margin is defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues. Combined operating margin for 2009, 2008 and 2007 was 30.1%, 27.4% and 17.0%, respectively. Impairment and other charges negatively impacted the 2007 combined operating margin by 7.4 percentage points. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense for 2009 decreased primarily due to lower average interest rates, and to a lesser extent, weaker foreign currencies, partly offset by higher average debt levels. Interest expense for 2008 increased primarily due to higher average debt levels, and to a lesser extent, higher average interest rates.

Translation and hedging activity primarily relates to net gains or losses on certain hedges that reduce the exposure to variability on certain intercompany foreign currency cash flow streams. Other expense primarily consists of gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, amortization of debt issuance costs and other nonoperating income and expenses. Interest income decreased for 2009 primarily due to lower average interest rates, while 2008 decreased primarily due to lower average interest rates and average cash balances. GAIN ON SALE OF INVESTMENT In 2009, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in Redbox to Coinstar, Inc., the majority owner, for total consideration of $140 million. As a result of the transaction, the Company recognized a nonoperating pretax gain of $95 million (after tax–$59 million or $0.05 per share). In 2008, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in U.K.-based Pret A Manger. In connection with the sale, the Company received cash proceeds of $229 million and recognized a nonoperating pretax gain of $160 million (after tax–$109 million or $0.09 per share). PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES In 2009, 2008 and 2007, the reported effective income tax rates were 29.8%, 30.0% and 34.6%, respectively. In 2009, the effective income tax rate benefited by 0.7 percentage points primarily due to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latam transaction. In 2007, the effective income tax rate was impacted by about 4 percentage points as a result of the following items: • A negative impact due to a minimal tax benefit of $62 million related to the Latam impairment charge of $1,641 million. This benefit was minimal due to the Company’s inability to utilize most of the capital losses generated by this transaction in 2007. • A positive impact due to a benefit of $316 million resulting from the completion of an IRS examination, partly offset by $28 million of expense related to the impact of a tax law change in Canada. Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.4 billion in both 2009 and 2008. 21 Table of Contents Substantially all of the net tax assets arose in the U.S. and other profitable markets. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Over the last several years, the Company has continued to focus its management and financial resources on the McDonald’s restaurant business as it believes the opportunities for long-term growth remain significant. Accordingly, during third quarter 2007, the Company sold its investment in Boston Market. As a result of the disposal, Boston Market’s results of operations and transaction gain are reflected as discontinued operations. In connection with the sale, the Company received proceeds of approximately $250 million and recorded a gain of $69 million after tax. In addition, Boston Market’s net loss for 2007 was $9 million. ACCOUNTING CHANGES • Sabbatical leave In 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on accounting for sabbatical leave, codified in the Compensation – General Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). Under this guidance, compensation costs associated with a sabbatical should be accrued over the requisite service period, assuming certain conditions are met. The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2007, as required and accordingly, recorded a $36 million cumulative adjustment, net of tax, to decrease the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. The annual impact to earnings is not significant. • Income tax uncertainties In 2006, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, codified primarily in the Income Taxes Topic of the FASB ASC. This guidance clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. The guidance also covers derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2007, as required. As a result of the implementation, the Company recorded a $20 million cumulative adjustment to increase the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. The guidance requires that a liability associated with an unrecognized tax benefit be classified as a long-term liability except for the amount for which cash payment is anticipated within one year. Upon adoption of the guidance, $339 million of tax liabilities, net of deposits, were reclassified from current to long-term and included in other long-term liabilities. • Fair value measurements In 2006, the FASB issued guidance on fair value measurements, codified primarily in the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC. This guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This guidance does not require any new fair value measurements; rather, it applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. The provisions of the guidance, as issued, were effective January 1, 2008. However, in February 2008, the FASB deferred the effective date for one year for certain non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (i.e., at least annually). The Company adopted the required provisions related to debt and derivatives as of January 1, 2008 and adopted the remaining required provisions for non-financial assets and liabilities as of January 1, 2009. The effect of adoption was not significant in either period. • Subsequent events In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance on subsequent events, codified in the Subsequent Events Topic of the FASB ASC. This guidance sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements. The guidance also indicates the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements, as well as the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. The Company adopted this guidance beginning in the second quarter 2009. The adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial statements, besides the additional disclosure. • Variable interest entities and consolidation In June 2009, the FASB issued amendments to the guidance on variable interest entities and consolidation, codified primarily in the Consolidation Topic of the FASB ASC. This guidance modifies the method for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity as well as the methods permitted for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. In addition, this guidance requires ongoing reassessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and enhanced disclosures related to a company’s involvement with a variable interest entity. This guidance was effective beginning January 1, 2010, and we do not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. Cash Flows The Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Cash provided by operations totaled $5.8 billion and $5.9 billion in 2009 and 2008, respectively, and exceeded capital expenditures by $3.8 billion in both years. In 2009, cash provided by operations decreased $166 million or 3% compared with 2008 despite increased operating results, primarily due to higher income tax payments, higher noncash income items and the receipt of $143 million in 2008 related to the completion of an IRS examination. In 2008, cash provided by operations increased $1.0 billion or 21% compared with 2007 primarily due to increased operating results and changes in working capital, partly due to lower income tax payments and the receipt of $143 million related to the IRS examination. 22 Table of Contents Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.7 billion in 2009, an increase of $31 million compared with 2008. This reflects lower proceeds from sales of investments, restaurant businesses and property, offset by lower capital expenditures, primarily in the U.S. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.6 billion in 2008, an increase of $475 million compared with 2007. Investing activities in 2008 reflected lower proceeds from sales of investments and higher capital expenditures, partly offset by higher proceeds from the sales of restaurant businesses and property and lower expenditures on purchases of restaurant businesses. Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.4 billion in 2009, an increase of $307 million compared with 2008, primarily due to lower net debt issuances, an increase in the common stock dividend and lower proceeds from stock option exercises, partly offset by lower treasury stock purchases. Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.1 billion in 2008, an increase of $118 million compared with 2007, which reflected lower proceeds from stock option exercises, mostly offset by higher net debt issuances. As a result of the above activity, the Company’s cash and equivalents balance decreased $267 million in 2009 to $1.8 billion, compared with an increase of $82 million in 2008. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES In 2009, the Company opened 824 traditional restaurants and 44 satellite restaurants (small, limited-menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 215 traditional restaurants and 142 satellite restaurants. In 2008, the Company opened 918 traditional restaurants and 77 satellite restaurants and closed 209 traditional restaurants and 196 satellite restaurants. The majority of restaurant openings and closings occurred in the major markets in both years. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure.

Approximately 65% of Company-operated restaurants and about 80% of franchised restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2009. Franchisees operated 81% of the restaurants at year-end 2009. Capital expenditures decreased $184 million or 9% in 2009 primarily due to fewer restaurant openings, lower reinvestment in existing restaurants in the U.S. and the impact of foreign currency translation. Capital expenditures increased $189 million or 10% in 2008 primarily due to higher investment in new restaurants in Europe and APMEA. In both years, capital expenditures reflected the Company’s commitment to grow sales at existing restaurants, including reinvestment initiatives such as reimaging in many markets around the world and, to a lesser extent in 2009, the Combined Beverage Business in the U.S. Capital expenditures invested in major markets, excluding Japan, represented 70% to 75% of the total in 2009, 2008 and 2007. Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts. Capital expenditures In millions 2009 2008 2007 New restaurants $ 809 $ 897 $ 687 Existing restaurants 1,070 1,152 1,158 Other(1) 73 87 102 Total capital expenditures $ 1,952 $ 2,136 $ 1,947 Total assets $ 30,225 $ 28,462 $ 29,392 (1) Primarily corporate equipment and other office related expenditures. New restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long-term growth. Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies and leveraging best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonald’s restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $2.7 million in 2009. The Company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2009 and 2008. SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS In 2009, the Company returned $5.1 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid, bringing the three-year total to $16.6 billion under the Company’s $15 billion to $17 billion cash returned to shareholders target for 2007 through 2009. Shares repurchased and dividends In millions, except per share data 2009 2008 2007 Number of shares repurchased 50.3 69.7 77.1 Shares outstanding at year end 1,077 1,115 1,165 Dividends declared per share $ 2.05 $ 1.625 $ 1.50 Dollar amount of shares repurchased $ 2,854 $ 3,981 $ 3,949 Dividends paid 2,235 1,823 1,766 Total returned to shareholders $ 5,089 $ 5,804 $ 5,715 In September 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a $10 billion share repurchase program with no specified expiration date. In September 2009, the Company’s Board of Directors terminated the then-existing share repurchase program and replaced it with a new share repurchase program that authorizes the purchase of up to $10 billion of the Company’s 23 Table of Contents outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date. In 2009, approximately 50 million shares were repurchased for $2.9 billion, of which 8 million shares or $0.5 billion were purchased under the new program. The Company reduced its shares outstanding at year end by over 3% compared with 2008, net of stock option exercises. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 34 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2009 full year dividend of $2.05 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.50 per share, with an increase to $0.55 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 10% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $2.20 per share annual dividend rate and reflects the Company’s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors. Financial Position and Capital Resources TOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNS Total assets increased $1.8 billion or 6% in 2009. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total assets increased $677 million in 2009. Over 70% of total assets were in major markets at year-end 2009. Net property and equipment increased $1.3 billion in 2009 and represented over 70% of total assets at year end. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net property and equipment increased $476 million primarily due to capital expenditures, partly offset by depreciation, the impact of refranchising and asset retirements related to reimaging. Operating income is used to compute return on average assets, while income from continuing operations is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. Assets of discontinued operations are excluded from average assets since operating income excludes results from discontinued operations. Returns on assets and equity 2009 2008 2007 Return on average assets 23.4 % 21.8 % 13.2 % Return on average common equity 34.0 30.6 15.1 In 2009, 2008 and 2007, return on average assets and return on average common equity both benefited from strong global operating results. During 2010, the Company will continue to concentrate restaurant openings and invest new capital in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long-term growth. In 2009, impairment and other charges (credits), net benefited return on average assets and return on average common equity by 0.2 percentage points and 0.7 percentage points, respectively. In 2007, impairment and other charges (credits), net reduced return on average assets by 5.4 percentage points. Impairment and other charges (credits), net partly offset by the 2007 net tax benefit resulting from the completion of an IRS examination, reduced return on average common equity by 8.5 percentage points in 2007. Operating income, as reported, does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. The inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by 2.0 percentage points, 1.9 percentage points and 1.3 percentage points in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. FINANCING AND MARKET RISK The Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2009 totaled $10.6 billion, compared with $10.2 billion at December 31, 2008. The net increase in 2009 was primarily due to net issuances of $219 million and changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt of $128 million.

Fitch, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s currently rate, with a stable outlook, the Company’s commercial paper F1, A-1 and P-2, respectively; and its long-term debt A, A and A3, respectively. The Company’s key metrics for monitoring its credit structure are shown in the preceding table. While the Company targets these metrics for ease of focus, it also considers similar credit ratios that incorporate capitalized operating leases to estimate total adjusted debt. Total adjusted debt, a term that is commonly used by the rating agencies referred to above, includes debt outstanding on the Company’s balance sheet plus an adjustment to capitalize operating leases. Based on their most recent calculations, these agencies add between $6 billion and $12 billion to debt for lease capitalization purposes, which increases total debt as a percent of total capitalization and reduces cash provided by operations as a percent of total debt for credit rating purposes. The Company believes the rating agency methodology for capitalizing leases requires certain adjustments. These adjustments include: excluding percent rents in excess of minimum rents; excluding certain Company-operated restaurant lease agreements outside the U.S. that are cancelable with minimal penalties (representing approximately 30% of Company-operated restaurant minimum rents outside the U.S., based on the Company’s estimate); capitalizing non-restaurant leases using a multiple of three times rent expense; and reducing total rent expense by a percentage of the annual minimum rent 24 Table of Contents payments due to the Company from franchisees operating on leased sites. Based on this calculation, for credit analysis purposes, approximately $4 billion of future operating lease payments would be capitalized. Certain of the Company’s debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company’s business. Under existing authorization from the Company’s Board of Directors, at December 31, 2009, the Company has $5 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to registered debt securities on a U.S. shelf registration statement and a Euro Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $1.3 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and Euromarket (see Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements). Debt maturing in 2010 is approximately $607 million of long-term corporate debt. In 2010, the Company expects to issue commercial paper and long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. The Company also has $599 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings outstanding at year-end. Historically, the Company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt. Although there are continued constraints in the overall financial markets on available credit, the Company’s ability to raise funding in the long-term and short-term debt capital markets has not been adversely affected. In January 2009, the Company issued $400 million of 10-year U.S. Dollar-denominated notes at a coupon rate of 5.0%, and $350 million of 30-year U.S. Dollar-denominated bonds at a coupon rate of 5.7%. In June 2009, the Company issued 300 million Euro ($423 million) of 7-year notes at a coupon rate of 4.25%. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All exchange agreements are over-the-counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $4.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. In addition, where practical, the Company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2009, neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Company’s supplemental benefit plan liabilities where our counterparty was required to post collateral on its liability position. The Company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Company’s largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures In millions of U.S. Dollars 2009 2008 Euro $ 5,151 $ 4,551 Australian Dollars 1,460 1,023 Canadian Dollars 981 795 British Pounds Sterling 679 785 Russian Ruble 501 407 The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the U.S. Based on the results of these analyses of the Company’s financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2009 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2009 levels would materially affect the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of 25 Table of Contents December 31, 2009. See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

Debt obligations do not include $80 million of noncash fair value hedging adjustments because these adjustments have no impact on the obligation at maturity, as well as $196 million of accrued interest. The Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of IRS limitations. The investment alternatives and returns are based on certain market-rate investment alternatives under the Company’s qualified Profit Sharing and Savings Plan. Total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $397 million at December 31, 2009 and are reflected on McDonald’s Consolidated balance sheet as follows: other long-term liabilities–$362 million, and accrued payroll and other liabilities–$35 million. Total liabilities for international retirement plans at December 31, 2009 were $184 million and were primarily reflected in other long-term liabilities. The Company has also recorded $492 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009, of which $286 million is included in other long-term liabilities and $206 million is included in deferred income taxes on the Consolidated balance sheet. Other Matters CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions. The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity: • Property and equipment Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods. • Share-based compensation The Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, such as the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate and expected volatility of the Company’s stock over the expected life, which significantly impact the assumed fair value. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. • Long-lived assets impairment review Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Company’s long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Company’s experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, the Company does not have any reporting units (defined as each individual country) with goodwill currently at risk of impairment. When the Company sells an existing business to a developmental licensee, it determines when these businesses are “held for sale” in accordance with guidance on the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. Impairment charges on assets held for sale are recognized when management and, if required, the Company’s Board of Directors have approved and committed to a 26 Table of Contents plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal, the disposal is probable of occurring within 12 months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than the assets’ net book value, among other factors. An impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the net book value of the business (including foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity) and the estimated cash sales price, less costs of disposal. An alternative accounting policy would be to recharacterize some or all of any loss as an intangible asset and amortize it to expense over future periods based on the term of the relevant licensing arrangement and as revenue is recognized for royalties and initial fees. Under this alternative for the 2007 Latam transaction, approximately $900 million of the $1.7 billion impairment charge could have been recharacterized as an intangible asset and amortized over the franchise term of 20 years, resulting in about $45 million of expense annually. This policy would be based on a view that the consideration for the sale consists of two components–the cash sales price and the future royalties and initial fees. The Company bases its accounting policy on management’s determination that royalties payable under its developmental license arrangements are substantially consistent with market rates for similar license arrangements. The Company does not believe it would be appropriate to recognize an asset for the right to receive market-based fees in future periods, particularly given the continuing support and services provided to the licensees. Therefore, the Company believes that the recognition of an impairment charge based on the net cash sales price reflects the substance of the sale transaction. • Litigation accruals From time to time, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. • Income taxes The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. During 2008, the IRS examination of the Company’s 2005-2006 U.S. tax returns was completed. The tax provision impact associated with the completion of this examination was not significant. During 2007, the Company recorded a $316 million benefit as a result of the completion of an IRS examination of the Company’s 2003-2004 U.S. tax returns. The Company’s 2007-2008 U.S. tax returns are currently under examination and the completion of the examination is expected in 2010. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $9.2 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If management’s intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES—INFLATION The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. RECONCILIATION OF RETURNS ON INCREMENTAL INVESTED CAPITAL Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Company’s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period. The denominator is the weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one- or three-year period. Adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less cash generated from investing activities related to the Boston Market, Chipotle, Latam, Pret A Manger and Redbox transactions. The weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter’s investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2009 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2009 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2008 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full year impact on 2009 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2008 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average. 27 Table of Contents The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one-year and three-year ROIIC are as follows (dollars in millions): One-year ROIIC Calculation Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 Incremental change NUMERATOR: Operating income $ 6,841.0 $ 6,442.9 $ 398.1 Depreciation and amortization 1,216.2 1,207.8 8.4 Currency translation(1) 324.3 Incremental adjusted operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates) $ 730.8 DENOMINATOR: Weighted–average adjusted cash used for investing activities(2) $1,893.8 Currency translation(1) 31.1 Weighted–average adjusted cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates) $1,924.9 One-year ROIIC(3) 38.0 % (1) Represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured.

63908,MCD,MCDONALDS CORP,2011,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS The Company franchises and operates McDonald’s restaurants. Of the 32,737 restaurants in 117 countries at year-end 2010, 26,338 were franchised or licensed (including 19,279 franchised to conventional franchisees, 3,485 licensed to developmental licensees and 3,574 licensed to foreign affiliates (affiliates)—primarily Japan) and 6,399 were operated by the Company. Under our conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and décor of their restaurant businesses, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants. Under our developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate and/or franchise restaurants within a market. We view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is important to delivering great, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. However, directly operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. In our Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. We continually review, and as appropriate adjust, our mix of Company-operated and franchised (conventional franchised, developmental licensed and foreign affiliated) restaurants to help optimize overall performance. The Company’s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. The business is managed as distinct geographic segments. Significant reportable segments include the United States (U.S.), Europe, and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA). In addition, throughout this report we present “Other Countries & Corporate” that includes operations in Canada and Latin America, as well as Corporate activities. The U.S., Europe and APMEA segments account for 34%, 40% and 21% of total revenues, respectively. The United Kingdom (U.K.), France and Germany, collectively, account for over 50% of Europe’s revenues; and China, Australia and Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), collectively, account for over 50% of APMEA’s revenues. These six markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as “major markets” throughout this report and comprise approximately 70% of total revenues. The Company continues to focus its management and financial resources on the McDonald’s restaurant business as we believe significant opportunities remain for long-term growth. Accordingly, in 2009, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in Redbox Automated Retail, LLC (Redbox) for total consideration of $140 million. In 2008, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in U.K.-based Pret A Manger for cash proceeds of $229 million. In connection with both sales, the Company recognized nonoperating gains. In analyzing business trends, management considers a variety of performance and financial measures, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth and returns. • Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because we believe this better represents the Company’s underlying business trends. • Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the Company’s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. McDonald’s reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays and weekend days in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts. The Company refers to these impacts as calendar shift/trading day adjustments. In addition, the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts. These impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have the greatest effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal. In 2008, there was an incremental full day of sales and guest counts due to leap year. • Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company’s financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. 10 Table of Contents • Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the adjusted cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The strength of the alignment among the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the System) has been key to McDonald’s success. This business model enables McDonald’s to deliver consistent, locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve. In addition, it facilitates our ability to identify, implement and scale innovative ideas that meet customers’ changing needs and preferences. McDonald’s customer-focused Plan to Win—which concentrates on being better, not just bigger—provides a common framework for our global business yet allows for local adaptation. Through the execution of initiatives surrounding the five elements of our Plan to Win—People, Products, Place, Price and Promotion—we have enhanced the restaurant experience for customers worldwide and grown comparable sales and customer visits in each of the last seven years. This Plan, combined with financial discipline, has delivered strong results for our shareholders. We have exceeded our long-term, constant currency financial targets of average annual Systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5%; average annual operating income growth of 6% to 7%; and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens every year since the Plan’s implementation in 2003, after adjusting for the loss in 2007 from the Latin America developmental license transaction. Given the size and scope of our global business, we believe these financial targets are realistic and sustainable over time, keeping us focused on making the best decisions for the long-term benefit of our System. In 2010, we continued to enhance the customer experience by remaining focused on the Company’s key global success factors of branded affordability, menu variety and beverage choice, convenience including daypart expansion, ongoing restaurant reinvestment and operations excellence. Initiatives around these factors successfully resonated with consumers driving increases in sales and customer visits despite challenging economies and a contracting Informal Eating Out (IEO) market in many countries. As a result, every area of the world contributed to 2010 global comparable sales and guest counts, which increased 5.0% and 4.9%, respectively. Growth in comparable sales is driven by the System’s ability to optimize guest count growth, product mix shifts and menu price changes. Pricing actions reflect local market conditions, with a view to preserving and improving margins, while continuing to drive guest counts and market share gains. In general, the goal is to achieve a balanced contribution of price and guest counts to comparable sales growth. In the U.S., we grew sales, guest counts, market share and restaurant cash flow, with comparable sales increasing for the 8th consecutive year, rising 3.8% in 2010. These positive results were achieved despite a declining IEO market. This performance was attributed to several factors including core menu items like Chicken McNuggets and burgers, everyday affordability and value options, such as the Breakfast Dollar Menu, additions to the McCafé beverage line, new snack offerings and limited time offerings such as the McRib sandwich. The national launch of McCafé frappés and real-fruit smoothies provided a meaningful extension to the McCafé line that was well-received by customers. Extending the snack wrap line with the Angus Snack Wraps allowed customers to enjoy popular McDonald’s burgers in a smaller, more portable fashion. Complementing these menu offerings were our convenient locations, efficient drive-thru service and value-oriented local beverage promotions. We broadened our accessibility through greater 24 hour operations and offered customers free Wi-Fi in over 12,000 restaurants. Modernizing the customer experience remained a focus with the extension of our interior and exterior reimaging program to enhance the appearance and functionality of our restaurants. In Europe, comparable sales rose 4.4%, marking the 7th consecutive year of comparable sales increases. Major contributors were France, the U.K., Russia and Germany. This performance reflected Europe’s strategic priorities of upgrading the customer and employee experience, increasing local relevance, and building brand transparency. Initiatives surrounding these platforms included leveraging our tiered menu featuring everyday affordable prices, menu variety including limited-time offerings, new dessert options, and reimaging almost 1,000 restaurants. We expanded our coffee business and have nearly 1,300 McCafé locations, which in Europe generally represent a separate area inside the restaurant that serves specialty coffees, indulgent desserts and light snacks. The expansion of self-order kiosks in France, Germany and Spain and the roll out of the new drive-thru customer order display system in over 3,000 restaurants enhanced service. In addition, we increased our accessibility and convenience with extended hours. We built upon the momentum of portable menu offerings with the introduction of McWraps—larger sized beef and chicken wraps in Germany, and P’tit Plaisir offerings in France. Finally, we continued building customer trust in our brand through communications that emphasized the quality and origin of McDonald’s food and our sustainable business initiatives. In APMEA, our momentum continued with nearly every country delivering positive comparable sales, led by Japan, Australia and China. Comparable sales rose 6.0% through strategies emphasizing value, core menu extensions, breakfast and convenience. Australia launched Family Dinner Boxes featuring popular menu items bundled together at a discounted price while China and Japan concentrated on affordability with Value Lunch platforms. New menu items such as a third Angus burger option in Australia and the extension of the Spicy Wings line in China were popular with consumers. Japan executed a successful U.S.-themed burger promotion and a Chicken Festival promotion featuring several products. Our dessert strategy is introducing consumers to the McDonald’s brand with products such as McFlurries and dessert kiosks in China, where we have become one of the largest retailers of ice cream. Our breakfast business continues to develop and is now offered in approximately 75% of APMEA restaurants. In Japan, value breakfast items, including the Sausage McMuffin and McGriddle, were rotated across several months, while Australia launched new breakfast menu items. 11 Table of Contents Nearly two-thirds of APMEA restaurants are now offering some form of extended hours and over 4,800 restaurants are open 24 hours. Delivery is offered in many APMEA markets and is now in approximately 1,600 restaurants, including nearly 400 in China. We continue to offer value to our customers by utilizing a strategic menu pricing tool that optimizes price, product mix, and promotions. This approach is complemented by a focus on driving operating efficiencies and effectively managing restaurant-level food and paper costs by leveraging our scale, supply chain infrastructure and risk management practices. Our ability to execute our strategies successfully in every area of the world, grow comparable sales, leverage a low commodity cost environment and control selling, general & administrative expenses resulted in consolidated combined operating margin (operating income as a percent of total revenues) of 31.0% in 2010, an improvement of 0.9 percentage points over 2009. In 2010, strong global sales and margin performance grew cash from operations, which rose $591 million to $6.3 billion. Our substantial cash flow, strong credit rating and continued access to credit provide us significant flexibility to fund capital expenditures and debt repayments as well as return cash to shareholders. Capital expenditures of approximately $2.1 billion were invested in our business primarily to open and reimage restaurants. Across the System, nearly 1,000 restaurants were opened and nearly 1,800 existing locations were reimaged. We returned $5.1 billion to shareholders consisting of $2.4 billion in dividends and nearly $2.7 billion in share repurchases. Cash from operations continues to benefit from our heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income received from owner/operators provides a very stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs. In addition, the franchise business model is less capital intensive than the Company-owned model. We believe locally-owned and operated restaurants maximize brand performance and are at the core of our competitive advantage, making McDonald’s not just a global brand, but also a locally relevant one. HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE YEAR INCLUDED: • Comparable sales grew 5.0% and guest counts rose 4.9%, building on 2009 increases of 3.8% and 1.4%, respectively. • Revenues increased 6% (5% in constant currencies). • Company-operated margins improved to 19.6% and franchised margins improved to 82.4%. • Operating income increased 9% (9% in constant currencies). • Earnings per share was $4.58, an increase of 11%. • Cash provided by operations increased $591 million to $6.3 billion. • The Company increased the quarterly cash dividend per share 11% to $0.61 for the fourth quarter–bringing our current annual dividend rate to $2.44 per share. • One-year ROIIC was 37.3% and three-year ROIIC was 38.3% for the period ended December 31, 2010 (see reconciliation on Page 25). • The Company returned $5.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends paid. OUTLOOK FOR 2011 We will continue to drive success in 2011 and beyond by enhancing customer relevance across all elements of our Plan to Win— People, Products, Place, Price and Promotion. Our global System continues to be energized by our ongoing momentum and significant growth opportunities. We continue to hold a strong competitive position in the market place, and we intend to further differentiate our brand by striving to become our customers’ favorite place and way to eat and drink. We will continue growing market share by executing our key strategies in the following areas: optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening our accessibility. These efforts will include increasing menu choice, expanding destination beverages and desserts, enhancing our food image, accelerating our interior and exterior reimaging efforts and increasing the level and variety of conveniences provided to our customers. We will execute these priorities to increase McDonald’s brand relevance while continuing to practice operational and financial discipline. Consequently, we are confident we can again meet or exceed our long-term constant currency financial targets. In the U.S., our 2011 focus will include highlighting core menu classics such as the Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with Cheese and Chicken McNuggets, emphasizing the convenient and affordable food offered every day, and encouraging the trial of new products including Fruit & Maple Oatmeal and additional McCafé beverage offerings. We will continue offering value across the menu through the Dollar Menu at breakfast and the rest of the day. Opportunities around additional staffing at peak hours and increasing restaurants that operate 24 hours per day will broaden accessibility to our customers. In addition, our plans to elevate the brand experience encompass updating our technology infrastructure with a new point-of-sale (POS) system, enhancing restaurant manager and crew retention and productivity, and contemporizing the interiors and exteriors of approximately 600 restaurants through reimaging. Our business in Europe will continue to be guided by three strategic priorities: increasing local relevance, upgrading the customer and employee experience, and building brand transparency. We will increase our local relevance by complementing our tiered menu with a variety of limited-time food events as well as new snack and dessert options. In 2011, we will reimage approximately 850 restaurants as we progress towards our goal of having 90% of our interiors and over 50% of our exteriors reimaged by the end of 2012. Reimaging reinforces the quality of our brand while further differentiating us from the competition. We will leverage service innovations with the deployment of technologies such as the new POS system, self-order kiosks, hand-held order devices and drive-thru customer order displays to enhance the customer experience and help drive increased transactions and labor efficiency. We believe there is an opportunity to further build brand transparency by raising customer awareness about our food quality and product sourcing. In addition, we will communicate our efforts to preserve the environment through our sustainable business initiatives. Our European business in 2011 faces some headwinds from government-initiated austerity measures being implemented in many countries. While we will closely monitor consumer reactions to these measures, we remain confident that our business model will continue to drive profitable growth. In APMEA, we will continue our efforts to become our customers’ first choice for eating out by focusing on menu variety, value, restaurant experience and convenience. The markets will continue to execute against a combination of core menu 12 Table of Contents items, food events and limited-time offerings to present a balanced mix of products to our customers. Value will continue to be a key growth driver as we reinforce the affordability of our menu to consumers and build on our successful Value Lunch platforms. We will invest in our business primarily by opening over 600 new restaurants and reimaging over 500 existing restaurants while elevating our focus on service and operations to drive efficiencies. In China, we will continue to build a foundation for long-term growth by increasing our base of restaurants by approximately 15% in 2011 toward our goal of nearly 2,000 restaurants by the end of 2013. Convenience initiatives include expanding delivery service across the region and building on the success of our extended operating hours. McDonald’s has an ongoing commitment to optimize our restaurant ownership structure. A heavily franchised, less capital-intensive business model has favorable implications for the strength and stability of our cash flow, the amount of capital we invest and long-term returns. We continue to maintain a strong culture of financial discipline by effectively managing all spending in order to maximize business performance. In making capital allocation decisions, our goal is to elevate the McDonald’s experience by driving sustainable growth in sales and market share while earning strong returns. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures) to shareholders over the long term via dividends and share repurchases. McDonald’s does not provide specific guidance on diluted earnings per share. The following information is provided to assist in analyzing the Company’s results: • Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 1.5 percentage points to 2011 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies), most of which will be due to the 541 net traditional restaurants added in 2010. • The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point increase in comparable sales for either the U.S. or Europe would increase annual diluted earnings per share by about 3 cents. • With about 75% of McDonald’s grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Company’s commodity costs. For the full year 2011, the total basket of goods cost is expected to increase 2-2.5% in the U.S. and to increase 3.5-4.5% in Europe as compared to 2010. Some volatility may be experienced between quarters in the normal course of business. • The Company expects full-year 2011 selling, general & administrative expenses to decrease 2-3%, in constant currencies, partly due to higher incentive compensation in 2010 based on performance. In addition, fluctuations will be experienced between quarters due to certain items in 2010, such as the Vancouver Winter Olympics in February and the biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention in April. • Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full year 2011 to increase approximately 7% compared with 2010. • A significant part of the Company’s operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 40% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, Australian Dollar, British Pound and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 65% of the Company’s operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Company’s annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 20 cents. • The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full year 2011 to be approximately 30% to 32%. Some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate that is outside the annual range. • The Company expects capital expenditures for 2011 to be approximately $2.5 billion. About half of this amount will be used to open new restaurants. The Company expects to open about 1,100 restaurants including about 400 restaurants in affiliated and developmental licensee markets, such as Japan and Latin America, where the Company does not fund any capital expenditures. The Company expects net additions of about 750 traditional restaurants. The remaining capital will be used for reinvestment in existing restaurants. Over half of this reinvestment will be used to reimage approximately 2,200 locations worldwide, some of which will require no capital investment from the Company. 13 Table of Contents Consolidated Operating Results Operating results 2010 2009 2008 Dollars in millions, except per share data Amount Increase/(decrease) Amount Increase/(decrease) Amount Revenues Sales by Company-operated restaurants $ 16,233 5 % $ 15,459 (7 )% $ 16,561 Revenues from franchised restaurants 7,842 8 7,286 5 6,961 Total revenues 24,075 6 22,745 (3 ) 23,522 Operating costs and expenses Company-operated restaurant expenses 13,060 3 12,651 (7 ) 13,653 Franchised restaurants—occupancy expenses 1,378 6 1,302 6 1,230 Selling, general & administrative expenses 2,333 4 2,234 (5 ) 2,355 Impairment and other charges (credits), net 29 nm (61 ) nm 6 Other operating (income) expense, net (198 ) 11 (222 ) (35 ) (165 ) Total operating costs and expenses 16,602 4 15,904 (7 ) 17,079 Operating income 7,473 9 6,841 6 6,443 Interest expense 451 (5 ) 473 (9 ) 523 Nonoperating (income) expense, net 22 nm (24 ) 69 (78 ) Gain on sale of investment nm (95 ) 41 (160 ) Income before provision for income taxes 7,000 8 6,487 5 6,158 Provision for income taxes 2,054 6 1,936 5 1,845 Net income $ 4,946 9 % $ 4,551 6 % $ 4,313 Earnings per common share—diluted $ 4.58 11 % $ 4.11 9 % $ 3.76 Weighted-average common shares outstanding—diluted 1,080.3 1,107.4 1,146.0 nm Not meaningful. IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS While changing foreign currencies affect reported results, McDonald’s mitigates exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows, and purchasing goods and services in local currencies. In 2010, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results driven by stronger global curren- cies, primarily the Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, partly offset by the weaker Euro. In 2009, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results, primarily driven by the Euro, British Pound, Russian Ruble, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. In 2008, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results, driven by the stronger Euro and most other currencies, partly offset by the weaker British Pound.

Results also benefited by an after tax gain of $59 million or $0.05 per share due to the sale of the Company’s minority ownership interest in Redbox, reflected in Gain on sale of investment. Results were negatively impacted by $0.15 per share due to the effect of foreign currency translation. In 2008, net income and diluted earnings per common share were $4.3 billion and $3.76. Results benefited by a $109 million or $0.09 per share after tax gain on the sale of the Company’s minority ownership interest in Pret A Manger, reflected in Gain on sale of investment. The Company repurchased 37.8 million shares of its stock for nearly $2.7 billion in 2010 and 50.3 million shares of its stock for $2.9 billion in 2009, driving reductions of over 2% and 3% of total shares outstanding, respectively, net of stock option exercises. REVENUES The Company’s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Over the past three years, the Company has continued to optimize its restaurant ownership mix, cash flow and returns through its refranchising strategy. The shift to a greater percent- age of franchised restaurants negatively impacted consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales shifted to franchised sales, where the Company receives rent and/or royalties based on a percent of sales. In 2010, constant currency revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales. The impact of refranchising on consolidated revenues lessened because the number of Company-operated restaurants sold to franchisees has declined compared with 2009 and 2008, in line with our overall strategy. In 2009, constant currency revenue growth was driven by positive comparable sales and expansion, partly offset by the impact of refranchising in certain of the Company’s major markets.

New products introduced in 2010 included McCafé frappés and smoothies as well as the Angus Snack Wraps, while new products introduced in 2009 included McCafé premium coffees and the Angus Third Pounder. Refranchising activity negatively impacted revenue growth in both years. Europe’s constant currency increases in revenues in 2010 and 2009 were primarily driven by comparable sales increases in the U.K., France and Russia (which is entirely Company-operated) as well as expansion in Russia. These increases were partly offset by the impact of refranchising activity, primarily in the U.K. in 2010 and the U.K. and Germany in 2009. In APMEA, the constant currency increase in revenues in 2010 was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in China, Australia and most other markets. The 2009 increase was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in Australia and most other Asian markets, partly offset by negative comparable sales in China. In addition, expansion in China contributed to the increases in both years. 15 Table of Contents The following tables present comparable sales and Systemwide sales increases/(decreases): Comparable sales increases 2010 2009 2008 U.S. 3.8 % 2.6 % 4.0 % Europe 4.4 5.2 8.5 APMEA 6.0 3.4 9.0 Other Countries & Corporate 11.3 5.5 13.0 Total 5.0 % 3.8 % 6.9 % On a consolidated basis, comparable guest counts increased 4.9%, 1.4% and 3.1% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Franchised margin dollars represented about two-thirds of the combined restaurant margins in 2010, 2009 and 2008. Franchised margin dollars increased $479 million or 8% (8% in constant currencies) in 2010 and $254 million or 4% (7% in constant currencies) in 2009. Positive comparable sales were the primary driver of the constant currency growth in franchise margin dollars in both years. Refranchising activity also contributed to the constant currency growth in franchise margin dollars in 2009 and to a lesser extent in 2010.

The 2009 decrease was due to additional depreciation primarily related to the Company’s investment in the beverage initiative, partly offset by positive comparable sales. Europe’s franchised margin percent decreased in 2010 and 2009 as positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher occupancy expenses, the cost of strategic brand and sales building initiatives and the refranchising strategy. In APMEA, the franchised margin percent decrease in 2010 was primarily driven by foreign currency translation, mostly due to the stronger Australian dollar. The franchised margin percent in APMEA and Other Countries & Corporate is higher relative to the U.S. and Europe due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed and/or affiliated restaurants where the Company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs. • Company-operated margins Company-operated margin dollars represent sales by Company-operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. Company-operated margin dollars increased $366 million or 13% (12% in constant currencies) in 2010 and decreased $101 million or 3% (increased 3% in constant currencies) in 2009. Positive comparable sales and lower commodity costs were the primary drivers of the constant currency growth in Company-operated margin dollars and percent in 2010. Positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher commodity costs, drove growth in constant currency Company-operated margin dollars and percent in 2009. In addition, refranchising activity negatively impacted Company-operated margin dollars, but benefited Company-operated margin percent in 2009 and to a lesser extent in 2010. 16 Table of Contents Company-operated margins In millions 2010 2009 2008 U.S. $ 902 $ 832 $ 856 Europe 1,373 1,240 1,340 APMEA 764 624 584 Other Countries & Corporate 134 111 128 Total $ 3,173 $ 2,807 $ 2,908 Percent of sales U.S. 21.3 % 19.4 % 18.5 % Europe 19.8 18.4 18.0 APMEA 17.8 16.8 15.9 Other Countries & Corporate 17.2 15.2 15.3 Total 19.6 % 18.2 % 17.6 % In the U.S., the Company-operated margin percent increased in 2010 due to lower commodity costs and positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor costs. The margin percent increased in 2009 due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by additional depreciation related to the beverage initiative and higher commodity costs. Refranchising had a positive impact on both periods. Europe’s Company-operated margin percent increased in 2010 primarily due to positive comparable sales and lower commodity costs, partly offset by higher labor costs. The margin percent increased in 2009 primarily due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher commodity and labor costs. In 2009, local inflation and the impact of weaker currencies on the cost of certain imported products drove higher costs, primarily in Russia, and negatively impacted the Company-operated margin percent. In APMEA, the Company-operated margin percent increased in 2010 primarily due to positive comparable sales and lower commodity costs, partly offset by higher occupancy & other costs and increased labor costs. The margin percent increased in 2009 due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor costs. • Supplemental information regarding Company-operated restaurants We continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance, profits and returns. In most cases, franchising is the best way to achieve these goals, but as previously stated, Company-operated restaurants are also important to our success. We report results for Company-operated restaurants based on their sales, less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs. We report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues, less associated occupancy costs. For this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure, we do not specifically allocate selling, general & administrative expenses and other operating (income) expenses to Company-operated or franchised restaurants. Other operating items that relate to the Company-operated restaurants generally include gains/losses on sales of restaurant businesses and write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements. We believe the following information about Company-operated restaurants in our most significant markets provides an additional perspective on this business. Management responsible for our Company-operated restaurants in these markets analyzes the Company-operated business on this basis to assess its performance. Management of the Company also considers this information when evaluating restaurant ownership mix, subject to other relevant considerations. The following table seeks to illustrate the two components of our Company-operated margins. The first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations, which we refer to as “Store operating margin.” The second relates to the value of our brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties. We refer to this component as “Brand/real estate margin.” Both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties, although rent and royalties for Company-operated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation. Rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales, and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of McDonald’s investment in the restaurant. Royalty rates may also vary by market. As shown in the following table, in disaggregating the components of our Company-operated margins, certain costs with respect to Company-operated restaurants are reflected in Brand/real estate margin. Those costs consist of rent payable by McDonald’s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy & other operating expenses recorded in the Consolidated statement of income. Store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses, and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating Brand/real estate margin. While we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our Company-operated business, it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the Company in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In particular, as noted previously, we do not allocate selling, general & administrative expenses to our Company-operated business. However, we believe that a range of $40,000 to $50,000 per restaurant, on average, is a typical range of costs to support this business in the U.S. The actual costs in markets outside the U.S. will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market. These costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant. 17 Table of Contents U.S. Europe Dollars in millions 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 As reported Number of Company-operated restaurants at year end 1,550 1,578 1,782 2,005 2,001 2,024 Sales by Company-operated restaurants $ 4,229 $ 4,295 $ 4,636 $ 6,932 $ 6,721 $ 7,424 Company-operated margin $ 902 $ 832 $ 856 $ 1,373 $ 1,240 $ 1,340 Store operating margin Company-operated margin $ 902 $ 832 $ 856 $ 1,373 $ 1,240 $ 1,340 Plus: Outside rent expense(1) 60 65 74 223 222 254 Depreciation—buildings & leasehold improvements(1) 65 70 70 105 100 110 Less: Rent & royalties(2) (619 ) (634 ) (684 ) (1,335 ) (1,306 ) (1,435 ) Store operating margin $ 408 $ 333 $ 316 $ 366 $ 256 $ 269 Brand/real estate margin Rent & royalties(2) $ 619 $ 634 $ 684 $ 1,335 $ 1,306 $ 1,435 Less: Outside rent expense(1) (60 ) (65 ) (74 ) (223 ) (222 ) (254 ) Depreciation—buildings & leasehold improvements(1) (65 ) (70 ) (70 ) (105 ) (100 ) (110 ) Brand/real estate margin $ 494 $ 499 $ 540 $ 1,007 $ 984 $ 1,071 (1) Represents certain costs recorded as occupancy & other operating expenses in the Consolidated statement of income – rent payable by McDonald’s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements.

This adjustment is made to reflect expense in Store operating margin and income in Brand/real estate margin. Countries within Europe have varying economic profiles and a wide range of rent and royalty rates as a percentage of sales. SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Consolidated selling, general & administrative expenses increased 4% (4% in constant currencies) in 2010 and decreased 5% (2% in constant currencies) in 2009. The Vancouver Winter Olympics in February and the Company’s biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention in April contributed to the increase in 2010. The 2009 expenses decreased partly due to costs in 2008 related to the Beijing Summer Olympics and the Company’s biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention.

Selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales were 3.0% in 2010 compared with 3.1% in 2009 and 3.3% in 2008. Management believes that analyzing selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales, as well as revenues, is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support Systemwide restaurants. 18 Table of Contents IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER CHARGES (CREDITS), NET The Company recorded impairment and other charges (credits), net of $29 million in 2010, ($61) million in 2009 and $6 million in 2008.

In 2010, the Company recorded expense of $29 million primarily related to its share of restaurant closing costs in McDonald’s Japan in conjunction with the first quarter strategic review of the market’s restaurant portfolio, partly offset by income related to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. In 2009, the Company recorded income of $61 million related primarily to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. The Company also recognized a tax benefit in 2009 in connection with this income, mainly related to the release of a tax valuation allowance. OTHER OPERATING (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET Other operating (income) expense, net In millions 2010 2009 2008 Gains on sales of restaurant businesses $ (79 ) $ (113 ) $ (126 ) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates (164 ) (168 ) (111 ) Asset dispositions and other expense 45 59 72 Total $ (198 ) $ (222 ) $ (165 ) • Gains on sales of restaurant businesses Gains on sales of restaurant businesses include gains from sales of Company-operated restaurants as well as gains from exercises of purchase options by franchisees with business facilities lease arrangements (arrangements where the Company leases the businesses, including equipment, to franchisees who generally have options to purchase the businesses). The Company’s purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business. The Company realized lower gains on sales of restaurant businesses in 2010 compared with 2009 and 2008 primarily as a result of selling less Company-operated restaurants to franchisees. • Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates Unconsolidated affiliates and partnerships are businesses in which the Company actively participates, but does not control. The Company records equity in earnings from these entities representing McDonald’s share of results. For foreign affiliated markets – primarily Japan – results are reported after interest expense and income taxes. McDonald’s share of results for partnerships in certain consolidated markets such as the U.S. is reported before income taxes. These partnership restaurants are operated under conventional franchise arrangements and, therefore, are classified as conventional franchised restaurants. Results in 2010 reflected a reduction in the number of unconsolidated affiliate restaurants worldwide partly offset by improved operating performance in Japan. Results in 2009 also reflected improved operating performance in Japan and benefited from the stronger Japanese Yen. • Asset dispositions and other expense Asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for restaurant closings and uncollectible receivables, asset write-offs due to restaurant reinvestment, and other miscellaneous income and expenses. 19 Table of Contents OPERATING INCOME Operating income Amount Increase/(decrease) Increase/(decrease) excluding currency translation Dollars in millions 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2010 2009 U.S. $ 3,446 $ 3,232 $ 3,060 7 % 6 % 7 % 6 % Europe 2,797 2,588 2,608 8 (1 ) 12 8 APMEA 1,200 989 819 21 21 11 23 Other Countries & Corporate 30 32 (44 ) (6 ) nm (43 ) nm Total $ 7,473 $ 6,841 $ 6,443 9 % 6 % 9 % 10 % nm Not meaningful. In the U.S., 2010 results increased due to higher combined restaurant margin dollars. Results for 2009 increased primarily due to higher franchised margin dollars. In Europe, results for 2010 and 2009 were driven by stronger operating performance in France, Russia and the U.K. In APMEA, 2010 results increased due to stronger results in Australia and many other markets. The Company’s share of impairment charges related to restaurant closings in Japan negatively impacted the growth rate by 4 percentage points for the year. Results for 2009 were driven primarily by strong results in Australia and expansion in China. In Other Countries & Corporate, results for 2010 and 2009 included income of $21 million and $65 million, respectively, primarily related to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. • Combined operating margin Combined operating margin is defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues. Combined operating margin for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was 31.0%, 30.1% and 27.4%, respectively. Impairment and other charges (credits), net negatively impacted the combined operating margin by 0.2 percentage points in 2010, while positively impacting it by 0.3 percentage points in 2009. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense decreased in 2010 primarily due to lower average interest rates slightly offset by higher average debt balances. Interest expense decreased in 2009 primarily due to lower average interest rates, and to a lesser extent, weaker foreign currencies, partly offset by higher average debt levels.

Interest income decreased in 2009 primarily due to lower average interest rates. Foreign currency and hedging activity primarily relates to net gains or losses on certain hedges that reduce the exposure to variability on certain intercompany foreign currency cash flow streams. Other expense primarily consists of amortization of debt issuance costs and other nonoperating income and expenses. GAIN ON SALE OF INVESTMENT In 2009, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in Redbox to Coinstar, Inc., the majority owner, for total consideration of $140 million. As a result of the transaction, the Company recognized a nonoperating pretax gain of $95 million (after tax–$59 million or $0.05 per share). In 2008, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in U.K.-based Pret A Manger. In connection with the sale, the Company received cash proceeds of $229 million and recognized a nonoperating pretax gain of $160 million (after tax–$109 million or $0.09 per share). PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the reported effective income tax rates were 29.3%, 29.8% and 30.0%, respectively. In 2010, the effective income tax rate decreased due to higher tax benefits related to foreign operations. In 2009, the effective income tax rate benefited by 0.7 percentage points primarily due to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Substantially all of the net tax assets arose in the U.S. and other profitable markets. ACCOUNTING CHANGES • Fair value measurements In 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on fair value measurements, codified primarily in the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). This guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This guidance does not require any new fair value measurements; rather, it applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. The provisions of the guidance, as issued, were effective January 1, 2008. However, in February 2008, the FASB deferred the effective date for one year for certain non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial 20 Table of Contents statements on a recurring basis (i.e., at least annually). The Company adopted the required provisions related to debt and derivatives as of January 1, 2008 and adopted the remaining required provisions for non-financial assets and liabilities as of January 1, 2009. The effect of adoption was not significant in either period. • Variable interest entities and consolidation In June 2009, the FASB issued amendments to the guidance on variable interest entities and consolidation, codified primarily in the Consolidation Topic of the FASB ASC. This guidance modifies the method for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity as well as the methods permitted for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. In addition, this guidance requires ongoing reassessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and enhanced disclosures related to a company’s involvement with a variable interest entity. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2010. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees, suppliers, and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. Generally, these businesses qualify for a scope exception under the consolidation guidance. The Company has concluded that consolidation of any such entities is not appropriate for the periods presented. As a result, the adoption did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Cash Flows The Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Cash provided by operations totaled $6.3 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.2 billion in 2010, while cash provided by operations totaled $5.8 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $3.8 billion in 2009. In 2010, cash provided by operations increased $591 million or 10% compared with 2009 primarily due to increased operating results. In 2009, cash provided by operations decreased $166 million or 3% compared with 2008 despite increased operating results, primarily due to higher income tax payments, higher noncash income items and the receipt of $143 million in 2008 related to the completion of an IRS examination. Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.1 billion in 2010, an increase of $401 million compared with 2009. This reflects higher capital expenditures and lower proceeds from sales of investments and restaurant businesses. Cash used for investing activities totaled $1.7 billion in 2009, an increase of $31 million compared with 2008. This reflects lower proceeds from sales of investments, restaurant businesses and property, offset by lower capital expenditures, primarily in the U.S. Cash used for financing activities totaled $3.7 billion in 2010, a decrease of $692 million compared with 2009, primarily due to higher net debt issuances, higher proceeds from stock option exercises and lower treasury stock purchases, partly offset by an increase in the common stock dividend. Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.4 billion in 2009, an increase of $307 million compared with 2008, primarily due to lower net debt issuances, an increase in the common stock dividend and lower proceeds from stock option exercises, partly offset by lower treasury stock purchases. As a result of the above activity, the Company’s cash and equivalents balance increased $591 million in 2010 to $2.4 billion, compared with a decrease of $267 million in 2009. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES In 2010, the Company opened 957 traditional restaurants and 35 satellite restaurants (small, limited-menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 406 traditional restaurants and 327 satellite restaurants. Of these closures, there were over 400 in McDonald’s Japan due to the strategic review of the market’s restaurant portfolio. In 2009, the Company opened 824 traditional restaurants and 44 satellite restaurants and closed 215 traditional restaurants and 142 satellite restaurants. The majority of restaurant openings and closings occurred in the major markets in both years. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure.

Approximately 65% of Company-operated restaurants and about 80% of franchised restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2010. About 80% of the restaurants at year-end 2010 were franchised. Capital expenditures increased $183 million or 9% in 2010 primarily due to higher investment in new restaurants. Capital expenditures decreased $184 million or 9% in 2009 primarily due to fewer restaurant openings, lower reinvestment in existing restaurants in the U.S. and the impact of foreign currency translation. In both years, capital expenditures reflected the Company’s commitment to grow sales at existing restaurants, including reinvestment initiatives such as reimaging in many markets around the world. Capital expenditures invested in major markets, excluding Japan, represented over 65% of the total in 2010, 2009 and 2008. Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts.

Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, and leveraging best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonald’s restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $2.6 million in 2010. The Company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2010 and 2009. SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS In 2010, the Company returned $5.1 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid. Shares repurchased and dividends In millions, except per share data 2010 2009 2008 Number of shares repurchased 37.8 50.3 69.7 Shares outstanding at year end 1,054 1,077 1,115 Dividends declared per share $ 2.26 $ 2.05 $ 1.625 Dollar amount of shares repurchased $ 2,649 $ 2,854 $ 3,981 Dividends paid 2,408 2,235 1,823 Total returned to shareholders $ 5,057 $ 5,089 $ 5,804 In September 2009, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a $10 billion share repurchase program with no specified expiration date. In 2009 and 2010 combined, approximately 45 million shares have been repurchased for $3.1 billion under this program. This program replaced the $10 billion share repurchase program that the Company’s Board of Directors approved in September 2007. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 35 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2010 full year dividend of $2.26 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.55 per share, with an increase to $0.61 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 11% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $2.44 per share annual dividend rate and reflects the Company’s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors. Financial Position and Capital Resources TOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNS Total assets increased $1.8 billion or 6% in 2010. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total assets increased $1.7 billion in 2010. Over 70% of total assets were in major markets at year-end 2010. Net property and equipment increased $529 million in 2010 and represented about 70% of total assets at year end. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net property and equipment increased $719 million primarily due to capital expenditures, partly offset by depreciation. Operating income is used to compute return on average assets, while net income is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. Returns on assets and equity 2010 2009 2008 Return on average assets 24.7 % 23.4 % 21.8 % Return on average common equity 35.3 34.0 30.6 In 2010, 2009 and 2008, return on average assets and return on average common equity benefited from strong global operating results. Operating income, as reported, does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. The inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by 1.9 percentage points, 2.0 percentage points and 1.9 percentage points in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. FINANCING AND MARKET RISK The Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2010 totaled $11.5 billion, compared with $10.6 billion at December 31, 2009. The net increase in 2010 was primarily due to net issuances of $787 million and changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt of $140 million.

Fitch, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s currently rate, with a stable outlook, the Company’s commercial paper F1, A-1 and P-1, respectively; and its long-term debt A, A and A2, respectively. Certain of the Company’s debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of 22 Table of Contents a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company’s business. Under existing authorization from the Company’s Board of Directors, at December 31, 2010, the Company has $3 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to registered debt securities on a U.S. shelf registration statement and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $1.3 billion available under committed line of credit agreements as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and Global market (see Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements). Debt maturing in 2011 is approximately $601 million of long-term corporate debt. In 2011, the Company expects to issue commercial paper and long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. The Company also has $595 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings outstanding at year-end 2010. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All exchange agreements are over-the-counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $4.7 billion and $4.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2010, neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Company’s supplemental benefit plan liabilities where our counterparty was required to post collateral on its liability position. The Company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Company’s largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures In millions of U.S. Dollars 2010 2009 Euro $ 5,465 $ 5,151 Australian Dollars 2,075 1,460 Canadian Dollars 1,123 981 Russian Ruble 589 501 British Pounds Sterling 547 679 The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the U.S. Based on the results of these analyses of the Company’s financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2010 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2010 levels would materially affect the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. 23 Table of Contents CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2010. See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

Debt obligations do not include $77 million of noncash fair value hedging adjustments or $201 million of accrued interest. The Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of IRS limitations. At December 31, 2010, total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $439 million. In addition, total liabilities for international retirement plans were $153 million and the Company recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $573 million. Other Matters CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions. The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity: • Property and equipment Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods. • Share-based compensation The Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Company’s stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. • Long-lived assets impairment review Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Company’s long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Company’s experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment 24 Table of Contents charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, the Company does not have any reporting units (defined as each individual country) with goodwill currently at risk of impairment. • Litigation accruals From time to time, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. • Income taxes The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. In 2010, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concluded its field examination of the Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for 2007 and 2008. As part of this exam, the Company resolved proposed adjustments related to transfer pricing matters that were previously received from the IRS. The tax provision impact associated with the completion of this field examination was not significant. The Company continues to disagree with the IRS’ proposed adjustments related to certain foreign tax credits of about $400 million, excluding interest and potential penalties. The Company continues to believe that these adjustments are not justified, and intends to pursue all available remedies. The Company cannot predict with certainty the timing of resolution; however, the Company does not believe the resolution will have a material impact on its results of operations or cash flows. During 2008, the IRS examination of the Company’s 2005 and 2006 U.S. federal income tax returns was completed. The tax provision impact associated with the completion of this examination was not significant. The IRS examination of the Company’s 2009 and 2010 U.S. federal income tax returns is expected to begin in 2011. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $11.0 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If management’s intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES—INFLATION The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. RECONCILIATION OF RETURNS ON INCREMENTAL INVESTED CAPITAL Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Company’s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period. The denominator is the weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one- or three-year period. Adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less cash generated from investing activities related to the Boston Market, Latin America developmental license, Pret A Manger and Redbox transactions. The weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter’s investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2010 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2010 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2009 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full year impact on 2010 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2009 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average. 25 Table of Contents The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one-year and three-year ROIIC are as follows (dollars in millions): One-year ROIIC Calculation Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 Incremental change NUMERATOR: Operating income $ 7,473.1 $ 6,841.0 $ 632.1 Depreciation and amortization 1,276.2 1,216.2 60.0 Currency translation(1) (22.2 ) Incremental adjusted operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates) $ 669.9 DENOMINATOR: Weighted–average adjusted cash used for investing activities(2) $ 1,821.1 Currency translation(1) (26.5 ) Weighted–average adjusted cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates) $ 1,794.6 One-year ROIIC(3) 37.3 % (1) Represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured.

63908,MCD,MCDONALDS CORP,2012,"ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS The Company franchises and operates McDonald’s restaurants. Of the 33,510 restaurants in 119 countries at year-end 2011, 27,075 were franchised or licensed (including 19,527 franchised to conventional franchisees, 3,929 licensed to developmental licensees and 3,619 licensed to foreign affiliates (affiliates)—primarily Japan) and 6,435 were operated by the Company. Under our conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and décor of their restaurant business, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants. Under our developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a limited number of affiliates that invest in real estate and operate and/or franchise restaurants within a market. We view ourselves primarily as a franchisor and believe franchising is important to delivering great, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. However, directly operating restaurants is paramount to being a credible franchisor and is essential to providing Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. In our Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that we believe are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. We continually review, and as appropriate adjust, our mix of Company-operated and franchised (conventional franchised, developmental licensed and foreign affiliated) restaurants to help optimize overall performance. The Company’s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms. The business is managed as distinct geographic segments. Significant reportable segments include the United States (U.S.), Europe, and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA). In addition, throughout this report we present “Other Countries & Corporate” that includes operations in Canada and Latin America, as well as Corporate activities. The U.S., Europe and APMEA segments account for 32%, 40% and 22% of total revenues, respectively. The United Kingdom (U.K.), France and Germany, collectively, account for over 50% of Europe’s revenues; and China, Australia and Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method), collectively, account for over 55% of APMEA’s revenues. These six markets along with the U.S. and Canada are referred to as “major markets” throughout this report and comprise approximately 70% of total revenues. In analyzing business trends, management considers a variety of performance and financial measures, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth and returns. • Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain incentive compensation plans on these results because we believe this better represents the Company’s underlying business trends. • Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of acceptance of the Company’s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. Growth in comparable sales is driven by guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. Generally, the goal is to achieve a balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check. McDonald’s reports on a calendar basis and therefore the comparability of the same month, quarter and year with the corresponding period of the prior year will be impacted by the mix of days. The number of weekdays and weekend days in a given timeframe can have a positive or negative impact on comparable sales and guest counts. The Company refers to these impacts as calendar shift/trading day adjustments. In addition, the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales and guest counts. These impacts vary geographically due to consumer spending patterns and have the greatest effect on monthly comparable sales and guest counts while the annual impacts are typically minimal. • Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company’s financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. • Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the adjusted cash used for investing activities 10 McDonald’s Corporation Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation. STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE The strength of the alignment between the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the System) has been key to McDonald’s success. This business model enables McDonald’s to consistently deliver locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers and be an integral part of the communities we serve. In addition, it facilitates our ability to identify, implement and scale innovative ideas that meet customers’ changing needs and preferences. McDonald’s customer-focused Plan to Win—which concentrates on being better, not just bigger—provides a common framework for our global business while allowing for local adaptation. Through the execution of multiple initiatives surrounding the five elements of our Plan to Win—People, Products, Place, Price and Promotion—we have enhanced the restaurant experience for customers worldwide and grown comparable sales and customer visits in each of the last eight years. This Plan, combined with financial discipline, has delivered strong results for our shareholders. We have exceeded our long-term, constant currency financial targets of average annual Systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5%; average annual operating income growth of 6% to 7%; and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens every year since the Plan’s implementation in 2003, after adjusting for the loss in 2007 from the Latin America developmental license transaction. Given the size and scope of our global business, we believe these financial targets are realistic and sustainable over time, keeping us focused on making the best decisions for the long-term benefit of our System. In 2011, we remained focused on customers’ needs and accelerated efforts within the Plan to Win where the greatest opportunity exists. The Company’s key global priorities of optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience, and broadening accessibility to our Brand represent areas where we are intensifying our efforts to drive the business further. Initiatives supporting these priorities resonated with consumers, driving increases in sales and customer visits despite challenging economies and a contracting Informal Eating Out (IEO) segment in many markets. As a result, every area of the world contributed to 2011 global comparable sales and guest counts increasing 5.6% and 3.7%, respectively. Specific menu pricing actions across our system reflect local market conditions as well as other factors, notably the food away from home and food at home inflation indices. In our Company-operated restaurants, we manage menu board prices to ensure value at all price points, increase profitability and mitigate inflation, all while trying to maintain guest count momentum. In order to accomplish these objectives, we utilize a strategic pricing tool that balances price, product mix and promotion. Franchisees also have access to, and many utilize, this strategic pricing tool. In general, we believe franchisees employ a similar pricing strategy. In 2011, we increased average price at Company-operated restaurants in each area of the world, although increases varied by market and region. We look to optimize product mix by utilizing a menu with entry-point value, core, premium and fourth-tier offerings. We also introduce new products that meet customer needs, which can expand average check and increase guest counts. In the U.S., we grew sales, guest counts and market share with comparable sales up for the ninth consecutive year, rising 4.8% in 2011, while comparable guest counts rose 3.3%. These results were achieved despite a slight decline in the IEO segment. We remained focused on maximizing our core business while providing customers with affordable products and value throughout our menu including options available on the Dollar Menu at breakfast and the rest of the day. We highlighted core menu items like Chicken McNuggets that featured new sauces, breakfast products including our new Fruit & Maple Oatmeal, additions to the McCafé beverage line and limited-time offerings such as the McRib sandwich. The national launch of the McCafé Frozen Strawberry Lemonade and Mango Pineapple real-fruit smoothie provided meaningful extensions to the McCafé beverage line. Convenient locations also continued to provide a competitive advantage with extended hours and efficient drive-thru service. Modernizing the customer experience remained a focus with the expansion of our major remodeling program to enhance the appearance and functionality of our restaurants and make our restaurants more relevant to our customers’ daily lives. Over 900 existing restaurants were remodeled during 2011 with the majority adding drive-thru capacity to capture additional guest counts. We also completed our two-year, Systemwide roll-out of a new point-of-sale system. This allows us to continue expanding our menu offerings while making it easier for our crew to fulfill every order accurately. In Europe, comparable sales rose 5.9%, marking the eighth consecutive year of comparable sales increases, and comparable guest counts rose 3.4%. Major contributors were the U.K., France, Russia and Germany. Initiatives that helped drive our business included leveraging our tiered menu featuring everyday affordable prices, menu variety including new and limited-time offerings, and reimaging over 900 restaurants. We continue to expand our coffee business and have over 1,500 McCafé locations, which in Europe are generally separate areas inside the restaurants that serve specialty coffees, indulgent desserts and snacks. We completed the rollout of the new drive-thru customer order display system in over 4,500 restaurants. In addition, we increased our accessibility and convenience with extended operating hours. We offered new premium menu items such as the 1955 burger and expanded McWraps across several European markets. In many markets, we have continued to offer a fourth-tier platform—such as Little Tasters in the U.K.—a range of tasty and appealing items in smaller portion sizes. Finally, we continued building customer trust in our brand through communications that emphasized the quality and origin of McDonald’s food and our commitment to sustainable business practices. In APMEA, our momentum continued with nearly every country delivering positive comparable sales, led by China and Australia. Comparable sales rose 4.7% and comparable guest counts rose 4.3% with performance driven by strategies emphasizing value, breakfast, convenience, core menu extensions, desserts and promotional food events. Australia launched a Value Lunch program that features meals at discounted price points for certain hours while China and Japan concentrated on affordability by continuing their Value Lunch platforms. New menu items such as real-fruit smoothies and frappés in Australia and the extension of the Value Breakfast program in China were popular with customers. Japan executed another successful U.S. themed burger promotion and celebrated its 40th anniversary by offering popular core menu items at reduced prices. Desserts McDonald’s Corporation Annual Report 2011 11 Table of Contents continue to play a meaningful role as we seek to deliver on customers’ menu expectations through products such as the McFlurry and unique delivery storefronts like the dessert kiosks in China, where we are now one of the largest ice cream retailers. Our breakfast business continues to evolve and is now offered in approximately 75% of APMEA restaurants. In Japan, rotational breakfast items, including the Chicken Muffin and Tuna Muffin, were offered during several months, while Australia launched new breakfast menu items such as bagel sandwiches. Nearly two-thirds of APMEA restaurants are now offering some form of extended operating hours and over 4,600 restaurants are open 24 hours. Delivery is offered in many APMEA markets and is now available in over 1,500 restaurants, including nearly 500 in China. McDonald’s Japan was negatively impacted by the natural disaster last March and as a result, continued to face some challenges throughout 2011. However, we remain confident that the market will continue to drive long-term profitable growth. Our approach to offering affordable value to our customers is complemented by a focus on driving operating efficiencies and effectively managing restaurant-level food and paper costs by leveraging our scale, supply chain infrastructure and risk management practices. Our ability to execute our strategies in every area of the world, grow comparable sales and control selling, general & administrative expenses resulted in combined operating margin (operating income as a percent of total revenues) of 31.6% in 2011, an improvement of 0.6 percentage points over 2010. In 2011, strong global sales and margin performance grew cash from operations, which rose $808 million to $7.2 billion. Our substantial cash flow, strong credit rating and continued access to credit provide us flexibility to fund capital expenditures and debt repayments as well as return cash to shareholders. Capital expenditures of approximately $2.7 billion were invested in our business primarily to open new restaurants and reimage existing restaurants. Across the System, 1,150 restaurants were opened and over 2,500 existing locations were reimaged. In addition, we returned $6.0 billion to shareholders consisting of $3.4 billion in share repurchases and $2.6 billion in dividends. Cash from operations continues to benefit from our heavily franchised business model as the rent and royalty income received from owner/operators is a very stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs. In addition, the franchise business model is less capital intensive than the Company-owned model. We believe locally-owned and operated restaurants maximize brand performance and are at the core of our competitive advantages, making McDonald’s not just a global brand but also a locally-relevant one.

OUTLOOK FOR 2012 We will continue to drive success in 2012 and beyond by enhancing the customer experience across all elements of our Plan to Win. Our global System continues to be energized by our ongoing momentum and significant growth opportunities. We hold a strong competitive position in the market place, and we intend to further differentiate our brand by striving to become our customers’ favorite place and way to eat and drink. Growing market share will continue to be a focus as we execute our three global priorities: optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening our accessibility. The menu efforts will include expanding destination beverages and desserts and enhancing our food image. The customer experience efforts will include accelerating our interior and exterior reimaging efforts and providing our restaurant teams with the appropriate tools, training, technology and staffing. The accessibility efforts will include increasing the level and variety of conveniences provided to our customers through greater proximity, extended operating hours and stronger value platforms. We will execute these priorities to increase McDonald’s brand relevance with operational and financial discipline. Consequently, we are confident we can again meet or exceed our long-term constant currency financial targets. In the U.S., our 2012 initiatives focus on balancing core menu classics with new products and promotional food events such as Chicken McBites, made with bite-sized pieces of premium chicken breast, Blueberry Banana Nut Oatmeal, and additional McCafé beverage offerings such as the Cherry Berry Chiller. We will continue offering value across the menu at breakfast and the rest of the day. Opportunities around additional staffing at peak hours during the breakfast and lunch day parts and increasing restaurants that operate 24 hours per day will allow us to broaden accessibility to our customers. In addition, our plans to elevate the brand experience include leveraging our new point-of-sale system with other technology enhancements such as using hand-held order takers and advancements to improve our front counter service system. We also will expand our major remodel program to another 800 locations in 2012. Our business plans in Europe are focused on building market share with the right mix of guest counts, average check, strategic restaurant reimaging and expansion. We will increase our local relevance by complementing our tiered menu with a variety of promotional food events as well as new snack and dessert options. In 2012, we will reimage approximately 900 restaurants as we progress towards our goal of having 90% of our interiors and over 65% of our exteriors reimaged by the end of the year. We will leverage service innovations by continuing the deployment of technologies such as updating the point-of-sale system, self-order kiosks and hand-held order devices to enhance the customer experience and help drive increased transactions and 12 McDonald’s Corporation Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents labor efficiency. We will also continue working to reduce our impact on the environment with energy management tools that enable us to use green energy in markets where available. In addition, the U.K. will be the proud host of our Olympic sponsorship, marking the ninth consecutive time that McDonald’s will serve as the Official Restaurant of the Olympic Games. In 2012, our European business will continue to face headwinds due to economic uncertainty and additional government-initiated austerity measures implemented in many countries. While we will closely monitor consumer reactions to these measures, we remain confident that our business model will continue to drive profitable growth. In APMEA, we will continue our efforts to become our customers’ first choice for eating out by continuing to provide robust value platforms and focusing on menu variety, restaurant experience and convenience. Value will continue to be a key growth driver as we reinforce the affordability of our menu to consumers across all dayparts, by building on our successful Value Lunch platforms and expanding our breakfast offerings. The markets will continue to execute against a combination of core menu items, promotional food events, desserts and limited-time offerings to provide a balanced mix of products to our customers. We will grow our business by opening approximately 750 new restaurants and reimaging about 475 existing restaurants while elevating our focus on service and operations to drive efficiencies. In China, we will continue to build a foundation for long-term growth by opening 225 to 250 restaurants in 2012 toward our goal of reaching 2,000 restaurants by the end of 2013. Convenience initiatives will focus on expanding delivery service across the region and building on the success of our extended operating hours. We continue to maintain strong financial discipline by effectively managing spending in order to maximize financial performance. In making capital allocation decisions, our goal is to make investments that elevate the McDonald’s experience and drive sustainable growth in sales and market share while earning strong returns. We remain committed to returning all of our free cash flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures) to shareholders over the long-term via dividends and share repurchases. McDonald’s does not provide specific guidance on diluted earnings per share. The following information is provided to assist in analyzing the Company’s results: • Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 2 percentage points to 2012 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies), most of which will be due to about 870 net traditional restaurants added in 2011. • The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point increase in comparable sales for either the U.S. or Europe would increase annual diluted earnings per share by about 3-4 cents. • With about 75% of McDonald’s grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Company’s commodity costs. For the full year 2012, the total basket of goods cost is expected to increase 4.5-5.5% in the U.S. and 2.5-3.5% in Europe, with more pressure expected in the first half. • The Company expects full-year 2012 selling, general & administrative expenses to increase about 6% in constant currencies, driven by certain technology investments, primarily to accelerate future restaurant capabilities, and costs related to the 2012 Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention and Olympics. The Company expects the magnitude of the increase to be confined to 2012. Fluctuations will be experienced between quarters due to the timing of certain items such as the Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention and the Olympics. • Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full year 2012 to increase approximately 6-8% compared with 2011. • A significant part of the Company’s operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 40% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 65% of the Company’s operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Company’s annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 24 cents. • The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2012 to be 31% to 33%. Some volatility may be experienced between the quarters resulting in a quarterly tax rate that is outside the annual range. • The Company expects capital expenditures for 2012 to be approximately $2.9 billion. About half of this amount will be used to open new restaurants. The Company expects to open more than 1,300 restaurants including about 450 restaurants in affiliated and developmental licensee markets, such as Japan and Latin America, where the Company does not fund any capital expenditures. The Company expects net additions of about 900 restaurants. The remaining capital will be used for reinvestment in existing restaurants. Nearly half of this reinvestment will be used to reimage more than 2,400 locations worldwide, some of which will require no capital investment from the Company.

IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonald’s mitigates exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows, and purchasing goods and services in local currencies. In 2011, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results driven by the stronger Euro and Australian Dollar as well as most other currencies. In 2010, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated operating results driven by stronger global currencies, primarily the Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, partly offset by the weaker Euro. In 2009, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on consolidated operating results, primarily caused by the weaker Euro, British Pound, Russian Ruble, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar.

Foreign currency translation had a positive impact of $0.19 on diluted earnings per share. In 2010, net income and diluted earnings per common share were $4.9 billion and $4.58. Results included after tax charges due to Impairment and other charges (credits), net of $25 million or $0.02 per share, primarily related to the Company’s share of restaurant closing costs in McDonald’s Japan (a 50%-owned affiliate) in conjunction with the strategic review of the market’s restaurant portfolio, partly offset by income related to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. Foreign currency translation had a positive impact of $0.01 per share on diluted earnings per share. In 2009, net income and diluted earnings per common share were $4.6 billion and $4.11. Results benefited by after tax income due to Impairment and other charges (credits), net of $91 million or $0.08 per share, primarily due to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. Results also benefited by an after tax gain of $59 million or $0.05 per share due to the sale of the Company’s minority ownership interest in Redbox, reflected in Gain on sale of investment. Results were negatively impacted by $0.15 per share due to the effect of foreign currency translation. The Company repurchased 41.9 million shares of its stock for $3.4 billion in 2011 and 37.8 million shares of its stock for nearly $2.7 billion in 2010, driving reductions of over 3% and 2% of total shares outstanding, respectively, net of stock option exercises. REVENUES The Company’s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. In 2011 and 2010, constant currency revenue growth was driven primarily by positive comparable sales as well as expansion.

New products introduced in 2011 included Fruit & Maple Oatmeal and additions to the McCafé beverage line, while new products introduced in 2010 included McCafé frappés and smoothies as well as the Angus Snack Wraps. Refranchising activity negatively impacted revenue growth in 2010. Europe’s constant currency increase in revenues in 2011 was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in Russia (which is entirely Company-operated), the U.K., France and Germany, as well as expansion in Russia. The 2010 increase was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in the U.K., France and Russia, as well as expansion in Russia, partly offset by the impact of refranchising activity primarily in the U.K. In APMEA, the constant currency increase in revenues in 2011 was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in China and most other markets. The 2010 increase was primarily driven by comparable sales increases in China, Australia and most other markets. In addition, expansion in China contributed to the increases in both years.

Franchised margin dollars represented about two-thirds of the combined restaurant margins in 2011, 2010 and 2009. Franchised margin dollars increased $768 million or 12% (9% in constant currencies) in 2011 and $479 million or 8% (8% in constant currencies) in 2010. Positive comparable sales were the primary driver of the constant currency growth in franchised margin dollars in both years.

In Europe, the franchised margin percent increase in 2011 was primarily due to positive comparable sales, partly offset by 16 McDonald’s Corporation Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents higher occupancy costs. Europe’s franchised margin percent decreased in 2010 as positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher occupancy expenses, the cost of strategic brand and sales building initiatives and the refranchising strategy. In APMEA, the franchised margin percent increase in 2011 was primarily due to a contractual escalation in the royalty rate for Japan in addition to positive comparable sales in most markets, partly offset by a negative impact from the strengthening of the Australian dollar. The 2010 decrease was primarily driven by a negative impact from the strengthening of the Australian dollar. The franchised margin percent in APMEA and Other Countries & Corporate is higher relative to the U.S. and Europe due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed and/or affiliated restaurants where the Company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs. • Company-operated margins Company-operated margin dollars represent sales by Company-operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. Company-operated margin dollars increased $282 million or 9% (5% in constant currencies) in 2011 and increased $366 million or 13% (12% in constant currencies) in 2010. The constant currency growth in Company-operated margin dollars in 2011 was driven by positive comparable sales partially offset by higher costs, primarily commodity costs, in all segments. Positive comparable sales and lower commodity costs were the primary drivers of the constant currency growth in Company-operated margin dollars in 2010.

The margin percent increased in 2010 due to lower commodity costs and positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher labor costs. Refranchising also had a positive impact on the margin percent in 2010. Europe’s Company-operated margin percent decreased in 2011 primarily due to higher commodity, labor, and occupancy costs, partially offset by positive comparable sales. The margin percent increased in 2010 primarily due to positive comparable sales and lower commodity costs, partly offset by higher labor costs. In APMEA, the Company-operated margin percent in 2011 reflected positive comparable sales, offset by higher commodity, labor and occupancy costs. Acceleration of new restaurant openings in China negatively impacted the margin percent. Similar to other markets, new restaurants in China initially open with lower margins that grow significantly over time. The APMEA margin percent increased in 2010 due to positive comparable sales and lower commodity costs, partly offset by higher occupancy & other costs and increased labor costs. Supplemental information regarding Company-operated restaurants We continually review our restaurant ownership mix with a goal of improving local relevance, profits and returns. In most cases, franchising is the best way to achieve these goals, but as previously stated, Company-operated restaurants are also important to our success. We report results for Company-operated restaurants based on their sales, less costs directly incurred by that business including occupancy costs. We report the results for franchised restaurants based on franchised revenues, less associated occupancy costs. For this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segments and not on the basis of our ownership structure, we do not specifically allocate selling, general & administrative expenses and other operating (income) expenses to Company-operated or franchised restaurants. Other operating items that relate to the Company-operated restaurants generally include gains/losses on sales of restaurant businesses and write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements. We believe the following information about Company-operated restaurants in our most significant segments provides an additional perspective on this business. Management responsible for our Company-operated restaurants in these markets analyzes the Company-operated business on this basis to assess its performance. Management of the Company also considers this information when evaluating restaurant ownership mix, subject to other relevant considerations. The following table seeks to illustrate the two components of our Company-operated margins. The first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operations, which we refer to as “Store operating margin.” The second relates to the value of our brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalties. We refer to this component as “Brand/real estate margin.” Both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurants are charged rent and royalties, although rent and royalties for Company-operated restaurants are eliminated in consolidation. Rent and royalties for both restaurant ownership types are based on a percentage of sales, and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of McDonald’s investment in the restaurant. Royalty rates may also vary by market. As shown in the following table, in disaggregating the components of our Company-operated margins, certain costs with respect to Company-operated restaurants are reflected in Brand/real estate margin. Those costs consist of rent payable by McDonald’s to third parties on leased sites and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements and constitute a portion of occupancy & other operating expenses recorded in the Consolidated statement of income. Store operating margins reflect rent and royalty expenses, and those amounts are accounted for as income in calculating Brand/real estate margin. While we believe that the following information provides a perspective in evaluating our Company-operated business, it is not intended as a measure of our operating performance or as an alternative to operating income or restaurant margins as reported by the Company in accordance with accounting principles McDonald’s Corporation Annual Report 2011 17 Table of Contents generally accepted in the U.S. In particular, as noted previously, we do not allocate selling, general & administrative expenses to our Company-operated business. However, we believe that about $50,000 per restaurant, on average, is the typical cost to support this business in the U.S. The actual costs in markets outside the U.S. will vary depending on local circumstances and the organizational structure of the market. These costs reflect the indirect services we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant.

This adjustment is made to reflect expense in Store operating margin and income in Brand/real estate margin. Countries within Europe have varying economic profiles and a wide range of rent and royalty rates as a percentage of sales. SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Consolidated selling, general & administrative expenses increased 3% (flat in constant currencies) in 2011 and increased 4% (4% in constant currencies) in 2010. The growth rate for 2011 was flat as higher employee and other costs were offset by lower incentive based compensation and costs in 2010 related to the Vancouver Olympics and the Company’s biennial Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention. The Olympics and Convention contributed to the increase in 2010.

Selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales were 2.8% in 2011 compared with 3.0% in 2010 and 3.1% in 2009. Management believes that analyzing selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales, as well as revenues, is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support Systemwide restaurants. 18 McDonald’s Corporation Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER CHARGES (CREDITS), NET The Company recorded impairment and other charges (credits), net of ($4) million in 2011, $29 million in 2010 and ($61) million in 2009.

In 2010, the Company recorded expense of $29 million primarily related to its share of restaurant closing costs in McDonald’s Japan in conjunction with the strategic review of the market’s restaurant portfolio, partly offset by income related to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. In 2009, the Company recorded income of $61 million related primarily to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. The Company also recognized a tax benefit in 2009 in connection with this income, mainly related to the release of a tax valuation allowance. OTHER OPERATING (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET Other operating (income) expense, net In millions 2011 2010 2009 Gains on sales of restaurant businesses $ (82 ) $ (79 ) $ (113 ) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates (178 ) (164 ) (168 ) Asset dispositions and other expense 27 45 59 Total $ (233 ) $ (198 ) $ (222 ) • Gains on sales of restaurant businesses Gains on sales of restaurant businesses include gains from sales of Company-operated restaurants as well as gains from exercises of purchase options by franchisees with business facilities lease arrangements (arrangements where the Company leases the businesses, including equipment, to franchisees who generally have options to purchase the businesses). The Company’s purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. Resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions are a recurring part of our business. The Company realized lower gains on sales of restaurant businesses in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily as a result of selling fewer Company-operated restaurants to franchisees. • Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates Unconsolidated affiliates and partnerships are businesses in which the Company actively participates, but does not control. The Company records equity in earnings from these entities representing McDonald’s share of results. For foreign affiliated markets—primarily Japan—results are reported after interest expense and income taxes. McDonald’s share of results for partnerships in certain consolidated markets such as the U.S. is reported before income taxes. These partnership restaurants are operated under conventional franchise arrangements and, therefore, are classified as conventional franchised restaurants. Results in 2011 reflected a benefit from stronger foreign currencies partly offset by the decline in the number of unconsolidated partnerships in the U.S. Results in 2010 reflected a reduction in the number of unconsolidated partnerships worldwide partly offset by improved operating performance in Japan. • Asset dispositions and other expense Asset dispositions and other expense consists of gains or losses on excess property and other asset dispositions, provisions for restaurant closings and uncollectible receivables, asset write-offs due to restaurant reinvestment, and other miscellaneous income and expenses. Asset dispositions and other expense declined in 2011 primarily due to higher gains on unconsolidated partnership dissolutions in the U.S. OPERATING INCOME Operating income Amount Increase/(decrease) Increase/(decrease)excluding currencytranslation Dollars in millions 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2011 2010 U.S. $ 3,666 $ 3,446 $ 3,232 6 % 7 % 6 % 7 % Europe 3,227 2,797 2,588 15 8 10 12 APMEA 1,526 1,200 989 27 21 17 11 Other Countries & Corporate 111 30 32 nm (6 ) nm (43 ) Total $ 8,530 $ 7,473 $ 6,841 14 % 9 % 10 % 9 % nm Not meaningful. In the U.S., 2011 and 2010 results increased primarily due to higher combined restaurant margin dollars, primarily franchised margin dollars. In Europe, results for 2011 and 2010 were driven by stronger operating performance in France, the U.K., Russia and Germany. The increases in 2011 and 2010 were driven by higher combined McDonald’s Corporation Annual Report 2011 19 Table of Contents restaurant margin dollars, primarily franchised margin dollars in 2011 and Company-operated margin dollars in 2010. In APMEA, 2011 results increased due to stronger operating results in many markets. Results for 2010 were primarily driven by stronger results in Australia and many other markets. Impairment charges in 2010 positively impacted the constant currency growth rate for 2011 by 4 percentage points and negatively impacted the 2010 growth rate by 4 percentage points. • Combined operating margin Combined operating margin is defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues. Combined operating margin for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was 31.6%, 31.0% and 30.1%, respectively. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense increased in 2011 primarily due to higher average debt balances and stronger foreign currencies, partly offset by lower average interest rates. Interest expense decreased in 2010 primarily due to lower average interest rates slightly offset by higher average debt balances.

Foreign currency and hedging activity includes net gains or losses on certain hedges that reduce the exposure to variability on certain intercompany foreign currency cash flow streams. Other expense primarily consists of miscellaneous nonoperating income and expense items such as amortization of debt issuance costs. GAIN ON SALE OF INVESTMENT In 2009, the Company sold its minority ownership interest in Redbox to Coinstar, Inc., the majority owner, for total consideration of $145 million. As a result of the transaction, the Company recognized a nonoperating pretax gain of $95 million (after tax – $59 million or $0.05 per share). PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the reported effective income tax rates were 31.3%, 29.3% and 29.8%, respectively. In 2011, the effective income tax rate increased due to lower tax benefits related to certain foreign tax credits, partially offset by nonrecurring deferred tax benefits related to certain foreign operations. In 2010, the effective income tax rate decreased due to higher tax benefits related to foreign operations. In 2009, the effective income tax rate benefited by 0.7 percentage points primarily due to the resolution of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2007 Latin America developmental license transaction. Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the U.S. and other profitable markets. ACCOUNTING CHANGES • Fair value measurements In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an update to Topic 820 – Fair Value Measurement of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). This update provides guidance on how fair value accounting should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards and does not extend the use of fair value accounting. The Company will adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2012, as required, and does not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. • Comprehensive Income In June 2011, the FASB issued an update to Topic 220 – Comprehensive Income of the ASC. The update is intended to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income in the financial statements. The guidance requires that the Company presents components of comprehensive income in either one continuous statement or two separate consecutive statements and no longer permits the presentation of comprehensive income in the Consolidated statement of shareholders’ equity. The Company will adopt this new guidance effective January 1, 2012, as required. • Variable interest entities and consolidation In June 2009, the FASB issued amendments to the guidance on variable interest entities and consolidation, codified primarily in the Consolidation Topic of the FASB ASC. This guidance modifies the method for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity as well as the methods permitted for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. In addition, this guidance requires ongoing reassessments of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and enhanced disclosures related to a company’s involvement with a variable interest entity. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2010. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its business relationships such as those with franchisees, joint venture partners, developmental licensees, suppliers, and advertising cooperatives to identify potential variable interest entities. Generally, these businesses qualify for a scope exception under the consolidation guidance. The Company has concluded that consolidation of any such entities is not appropriate for the periods presented. As a result, the adoption did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Cash Flows The Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Cash provided by operations totaled $7.2 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.4 billion in 2011, while cash provided by operations totaled $6.3 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $4.2 billion in 2010. In 2011, cash provided by operations increased $808 million or 13% compared with 2010 primarily due to higher operating results. In 2010, cash provided by operations increased $591 million or 10% compared with 2009 primarily due to higher operating results. 20 McDonald’s Corporation Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.6 billion in 2011, an increase of $515 million compared with 2010. This reflects higher capital expenditures, partly offset by higher proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses. Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.1 billion in 2010, an increase of $401 million compared with 2009. This reflects higher capital expenditures and lower proceeds from sales of investments and restaurant businesses. Cash used for financing activities totaled $4.5 billion in 2011, an increase of $804 million compared with 2010, primarily due to higher treasury stock purchases, an increase in the common stock dividend, and lower proceeds from stock option exercises, partly offset by higher net debt issuances. Cash used for financing activities totaled $3.7 billion in 2010, a decrease of $692 million compared with 2009, primarily due to higher net debt issuances, higher proceeds from stock option exercises and lower treasury stock purchases, partly offset by an increase in the common stock dividend. As a result of the above activity, the Company’s cash and equivalents balance decreased $51 million in 2011 to $2.3 billion, compared with an increase of $591 million in 2010. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES In 2011, the Company opened 1,118 traditional restaurants and 32 satellite restaurants (small, limited-menu restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 246 traditional restaurants and 131 satellite restaurants. In 2010, the Company opened 957 traditional restaurants and 35 satellite restaurants, and closed 406 traditional restaurants and 327 satellite restaurants. Of these closures, there were over 400 in McDonald’s Japan due to the strategic review of the market’s restaurant portfolio. The majority of restaurant openings and closings occurred in the major markets in both years. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure.

Approximately 65% of Company-operated restaurants and over 75% of franchised restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2011. Over 80% of the restaurants at year-end 2011 were franchised. Capital expenditures increased $595 million or 28% in 2011 primarily due to higher reinvestment in existing restaurants and higher investment in new restaurants. Capital expenditures increased $183 million or 9% in 2010 primarily due to higher investment in new restaurants. In both years, capital expenditures reflected the Company’s commitment to grow sales at existing restaurants, including reinvestment initiatives such as reimaging in many markets around the world. Capital expenditures invested in major markets, excluding Japan, represented over 65% of the total in 2011, 2010 and 2009. Japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts.

New restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long-term growth. Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, and leveraging best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonald’s restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $2.7 million in 2011. The Company owned approximately 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2011 and 2010. SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS For the last three years, the Company returned a total of $16.1 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid.

In 2009, 2010 and 2011 combined, approximately 87 million shares have been repurchased for $6.5 billion under this program. The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 36 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2011 full year dividend of $2.53 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.61 per share, with an increase to $0.70 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 15% increase in the quarterly dividend McDonald’s Corporation Annual Report 2011 21 Table of Contents equates to a $2.80 per share annual dividend and reflects the Company’s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors. Financial Position and Capital Resources TOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNS Total assets increased $1.0 billion or 3% in 2011. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, total assets increased $1.4 billion in 2011. Over 75% of total assets were in major markets at year-end 2011. Net property and equipment increased $774 million in 2011 and represented about 70% of total assets at year end. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net property and equipment increased $1.1 billion primarily due to capital expenditures, partly offset by depreciation. Operating income is used to compute return on average assets, while net income is used to calculate return on average common equity. Month-end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity. 2011 2010 2009 Return on average assets 26.0 % 24.7 % 23.4 % Return on average common equity 37.7 35.3 34.0 In 2011, 2010, and 2009, return on average assets and return on average common equity benefited from strong global operating results. Operating income, as reported, does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. The inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by about two percentage points for all years presented. FINANCING AND MARKET RISK The Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2011 totaled $12.5 billion, compared with $11.5 billion at December 31, 2010. The net increase in 2011 was primarily due to net issuances of $1.0 billion.

Certain of the Company’s debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company’s business. Under existing authorization from the Company’s Board of Directors, at December 31, 2011, the Company had $1.7 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $1.5 billion available under committed line of credit agreements as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and global markets (see Debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements). Debt maturing in 2012 is approximately $964 million of long-term corporate debt. In 2012, the Company expects to issue commercial paper and long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. Consequently, in February 2012, the Company issued $250.0 million of 10-year U.S. Dollar-denominated notes at a coupon rate of 2.625%, and $500.0 million of 30-year U.S. Dollar-denominated notes at a coupon rate of 3.70%. The Company also has $640 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings outstanding at year-end 2011. The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments. In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $5.0 billion and $4.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives. The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At 22 McDonald’s Corporation Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents December 31, 2011, neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Company’s supplemental benefit plan liabilities where our counterparty was required to post collateral on its liability position. The Company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Company’s largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows: Foreign currency net asset exposures In millions of U.S. Dollars 2011 2010 Euro $ 5,905 $ 5,465 Australian Dollars 2,409 2,075 Canadian Dollars 1,224 1,123 British Pounds Sterling 726 547 Russian Ruble 594 589 The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the U.S. Based on the results of these analyses of the Company’s financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2011 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2011 levels would materially affect the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2011. See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

Debt obligations do not include $56 million of noncash fair value hedging adjustments or $218 million of accrued interest. The Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of IRS limitations. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $482 million, and total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $565 million. There are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business. The amounts related to these commitments are not significant to the Company’s financial position. Such commitments are generally shorter term in nature and will be funded from operating cash flows. Other Matters CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under various assumptions or conditions. The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity: • Property and equipment Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with McDonald’s Corporation Annual Report 2011 23 Table of Contents similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods. • Share-based compensation The Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Company’s stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. • Long-lived assets impairment review Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Company’s long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Company’s experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, the Company does not have any reporting units (defined as each individual country) with goodwill currently at risk of impairment. • Litigation accruals In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. • Income taxes The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made. The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. In 2010, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concluded its field examination of the Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for 2007 and 2008. In connection with this examination, the Company received notices of proposed adjustments from the IRS related to certain foreign tax credits of about $400 million, excluding interest and potential penalties. The Company disagrees with the IRS’ proposed adjustments. The Company has filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office and expects resolution on this issue in 2012. The Company does not believe that the resolution will have a material impact on its results of operations or cash flows. The Company’s 2009 and 2010 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently under examination and the completion of the examination is expected in 2013. Deferred U.S. income taxes have not been recorded for temporary differences totaling $12.6 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate affiliates. The temporary differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings that are considered permanently invested in operations outside the U.S. If management’s intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided. EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES—INFLATION The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. RECONCILIATION OF RETURNS ON INCREMENTAL INVESTED CAPITAL Return on incremental invested capital (ROIIC) is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the business units, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Company’s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period. 24 McDonald’s Corporation Annual Report 2011 Table of Contents The denominator is the weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities during the applicable one-or three-year period. Adjusted cash used for investing activities is defined as cash used for investing activities less cash generated from investing activities related to the Pret A Manger and Redbox transactions. The weighted-average adjusted cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter’s investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2011 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2011 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2010 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full year impact on 2011 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2010 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average. The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one-year and three-year ROIIC are as follows: One-year ROIIC calculation (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 Incrementalchange NUMERATOR: Operating income $ 8,529.7 $ 7,473.1 $ 1,056.6 Depreciation and amortization 1,415.0 1,276.2 138.8 Currency translation(1) (331.4 ) Incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization (at constant foreign exchange rates) $ 864.0 DENOMINATOR: Weighted-average cash used for investing activities(2) $ 2,311.7 Currency translation(1) (11.3 ) Weighted-average cash used for investing activities (at constant foreign exchange rates) $ 2,300.4 One-year ROIIC(3) 37.6 % (1) Represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured.
