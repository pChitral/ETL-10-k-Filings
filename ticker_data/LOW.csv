As of January 30, 2015, Lowe's operated 1,840 home improvement and hardware stores, representing approximately 201 million square feet of retail selling space. Lowe's is comprised of 1,793 stores located across 50 U.S. states, including 74 Orchard Supply Hardware (Orchard) stores in California and Oregon, as well as 37 stores in Canada, and 10 stores in Mexico. Lowe’s was incorporated in North Carolina in 1952 and has been publicly held since 1961. The Company’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange - ticker symbol “LOW”.See Item 6, “Selected Financial Data”, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for historical revenues, profits and identifiable assets. For additional information about the Company’s performance and financial condition, see also Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Customers, Market and CompetitionOur CustomersWe serve homeowners, renters, and professional customers (Pro customers). Retail customers, comprised of individual homeowners and renters, complete a wide array of projects and vary along the spectrum of do-it-yourself (DIY) and do-it-for-me (DIFM). The Pro customer consists of two broad categories: construction trades; and maintenance, repair & operations.Our Market We are among the many businesses, including home centers, paint stores, hardware stores, lumber yards and garden centers, whose revenues are included in the Building Material and Garden Equipment and Supplies Dealers Subsector (444) of the Retail Trade Sector of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), the standard used by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and publishing statistical data related to the U.S. business economy. The total annual revenue reported for businesses included in NAICS 444 in 2014 was $328 billion, which represented an increase of 5.1% over the amount reported for the same category in 2013. The total annual revenue reported for businesses included in NAICS 444 in 2013 was $312 billion, which represented an increase of 6.0% over the amount reported for the same category in 2012.NAICS 444 represents less than half of what we consider the total market for our products and services. The broader market in which Lowe’s operates includes home-related sales through a variety of companies beyond those in NAICS 444. These consist of other companies in the retail sector, including mass retailers, home furnishings stores, and online retailers, as well as wholesalers that provide home-related products and services to homeowners, businesses, and the government. Based on our analysis of the most recent comprehensive data available, we estimate the size of the U.S. home improvement market at $690 billion in 2014, comprised of $520 billion of product sales and $170 billion of installed labor sales. That compares with $640 billion total market sales in 2013, comprised of $480 billion of product sales and $160 billion of installed labor sales. There are many variables that affect consumer demand for the home improvement products and services Lowe’s offers. Key indicators we monitor include real disposable personal income, employment, home prices, and housing turnover. We also monitor demographic and societal trends that shape home improvement industry growth. •Real disposable personal income is projected to grow at a stronger pace in 2015 than in 2014. Real disposable personal income is forecasted to increase 3.5% in calendar 2015, up from the 2.5% gain recorded in 2014, based on the March 2015 Blue Chip Economic Indicators®. **Blue Chip Economic Indicators® (ISSN: 0193-4600) is published monthly by Aspen Publishers, 76 Ninth Avenue, New York, NY 10011, a division of Wolters Kluwer Law and Business. Printed in the U.S.A.4Table of Contents•The average unemployment rate for 2015 is forecasted to decline to 5.4%, according to the March 2015 Blue Chip Economic Indicators, which would be an improvement from the 6.2% average in 2014. The unemployment rate should continue to trend lower as the job market continues to expand at a moderate pace.•Recent evidence suggests that home prices will continue to increase. In 2014, home price appreciation improved to an estimated 5.7%, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency index. Economists generally expect the rate of home price growth to moderate in 2015 but to remain positive.•Housing turnover decreased 2.8% in 2014 after a 9.0% increase in 2013, according to The National Association of Realtors and U.S. Census Bureau. Growth in 2014 was restrained by an increase in mortgage rates and harsh winter weather. Turnover is generally expected to increase in 2015, supported by a strengthening jobs market, rising incomes and historically low mortgage rates.These indicators are important to our business because they signal a customer's willingness to engage in home maintenance, repair, and upgrade projects and favorably impact income available to purchase our products and services. Currently, these indicators suggest moderately improving consumer demand for the home improvement products and services we sell. Our CompetitionThe home improvement retailing business includes a broad competitive landscape. We compete with other home improvement warehouse chains and lumberyards in most of our trade areas. We also compete with traditional hardware, plumbing, electrical and home supply retailers. In addition, we compete with general merchandise retailers, warehouse clubs, and online and other specialty retailers. Location of stores continues to be a key competitive factor in our industry; however, the increasing use of technology and the simplicity of online shopping also underscore the importance of omni-channel capabilities as a competitive factor. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing better customer experiences that make us the project authority while delivering value to our customers. See further discussion of competition in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Products and ServicesOur ProductsProduct SelectionTo meet customers’ varying home improvement needs, we offer a complete line of products for maintenance, repair, remodeling, and decorating. We offer home improvement products in the following categories: Kitchens & Appliances; Lumber & Building Materials; Tools & Hardware; Fashion Fixtures; Rough Plumbing & Electrical; Lawn & Garden; Seasonal Living; Paint; Home Fashions, Storage & Cleaning; Flooring; Millwork; and Outdoor Power Equipment. A typical Lowe's home improvement store stocks approximately 36,000 items, with hundreds of thousands of additional items available through our Special Order Sales system, Lowes.com, Lowes.ca, and ATGstores.com. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for historical revenues by product category for each of the last three fiscal years.We are committed to offering a wide selection of national brand-name merchandise complemented by our selection of private brands. In addition, we are dedicated to ensuring the products we sell are sourced in a socially responsible, efficient, and cost effective manner.National Brand-Name MerchandiseIn many product categories, customers look for a familiar and trusted national brand to instill confidence in their purchase. Each Lowe’s home improvement store carries a wide selection of national brand-name merchandise such as Whirlpool® appliances and water heaters, GE®, LG®, and Samsung® appliances, Stainmaster® carpets, Valspar® paints and stains, Pella® windows and doors, Sylvania® light bulbs, Dewalt® power tools, Owens Corning® roofing, Johns Manville® insulation, James Hardie® fiber cement siding, Husqvarna® outdoor power equipment, Werner® ladders, and many more. In 2014, we added brand name merchandise such as Henry® coatings, Hubbell® wiring devices, GRK Fasteners™, and Progress® Lighting to our portfolio. Our merchandise selection provides the retail and Pro customer a one-stop shop for a wide variety of national brand-name merchandise needed to complete home improvement, repair, maintenance, or construction projects.Private BrandsPrivate brands are an important element of our overall portfolio, helping to provide significant value and coordinated style across core categories. We sell private brands in several product categories including Tools & Hardware, Seasonal Living, 5Table of ContentsHome Fashions, Storage & Cleaning, Paint, Fashion Fixtures, Flooring, Millwork, Rough Plumbing & Electrical, and Lumber & Building Materials. Some of Lowe’s most important private brands include Kobalt® tools, allen+roth® home décor products, Blue Hawk® home improvement products, Project Source® basic value products, Portfolio® lighting products, Garden Treasures® lawn and patio products, Utilitech® electrical and utility products, Reliabilt® doors and windows, Aquasource® faucets, sinks and toilets, Harbor Breeze® ceiling fans, Top Choice® lumber products and Iris® home automation and management products.Supply ChainWe source our products from over 7,000 vendors worldwide with no single vendor accounting for more than 6% of total purchases. We believe that alternative and competitive suppliers are available for virtually all of our products. Whenever possible, we purchase directly from manufacturers to provide savings for customers and improve our gross margin.To efficiently move product from our vendors to our stores and maintain in-stock levels, we own and operate 15 highly-automated Regional Distribution Centers (RDC) in the United States. Through our RDCs, products are received from vendors, stored and picked, or cross-docked, and then shipped to our retail locations or directly to customers. On average, each domestic RDC serves approximately 115 stores. We also lease and operate a distribution facility to serve our Canadian stores. Additionally, we have a service agreement with a third party logistics provider to manage a distribution facility to serve our stores in Mexico.In addition to the RDCs, we also operate coastal holding facilities, transload facilities, and flatbed distribution centers. The flatbed distribution centers distribute merchandise that requires special handling due to size or type of packaging such as lumber, boards, panel products, pipe, siding, ladders, and building materials. Collectively, our facilities enable our import and e-commerce, as well as parcel post eligible products, to get to their destination as efficiently as possible. Most parcel post items can be ordered by a customer and delivered within two business days at standard shipping rates.On average, in fiscal 2014, approximately 80% of the total dollar amount of stock merchandise we purchased was shipped through our distribution network, while the remaining portion was shipped directly to our stores from vendors.Our ServicesInstalled SalesWe offer installation services through independent contractors in many of our product categories, with Flooring, Millwork and Kitchens & Appliances accounting for the majority of installed sales. Our Installed Sales model, which separates selling and project administration tasks, allows our sales associates to focus on project selling, while project managers ensure that the details related to installing the products are efficiently executed. Installed Sales, which includes both product and labor, accounted for approximately 8% of total sales in fiscal 2014.Extended Protection Plans and Repair ServicesWe offer extended protection plans in Kitchens & Appliances, Tools & Hardware, Outdoor Power Equipment, Seasonal Living, and Rough Plumbing. Lowe’s Protection Plans provide customers with product protection that enhances or extends coverage previously offered by the manufacturer’s warranty. We provide in-warranty and out-of-warranty repair services for major appliances, outdoor power equipment, tools, grills, fireplaces, and water heaters through our stores or in the home through our Lowe’s Authorized Service Repair Network. We offer replacement plans in products in these categories priced below $200. Our contact center takes customers' calls, assesses the problems, and facilitates a resolution, making after-sales service easier for our customers because we manage the entire process.Selling ChannelsWe are continuing our progress towards becoming an omni-channel retail company, which allows our customers to move from channel to channel with simple and seamless transitions even within the same transaction. For example, for many projects, more than half of our customers conduct research online before making an in-store purchase. For purchases made on Lowes.com, approximately 60% are picked up in-store, 10% are delivered from a store, and 30% are parcel shipped. Regardless of the channels through which customers choose to engage with us, we strive to provide them with a seamless experience across channels and an endless aisle of products, enabled by our flexible fulfillment capabilities. Our ability to sell products in-store, online, on-site, or through our contact centers speaks to our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure with the omni-channel capabilities we are introducing.6Table of ContentsIn-StoreOur 1,766 home improvement stores are generally open seven days per week and average approximately 112,000 square feet of retail selling space, plus approximately 32,000 square feet of outdoor garden center selling space. In addition, we operate 74 Orchard stores located throughout California and Oregon that also serve home improvement customers. Our home improvement stores offer similar products and services, with certain variations based on local market factors; however, Orchard stores are primarily focused on paint, repair, and backyard products. We continue to develop and implement tools to make our sales associates more efficient and to integrate our order management and fulfillment processes. Our home improvement stores have Wi-Fi capabilities that provide customers with internet access, making information available quickly to further simplify the shopping experience. OnlineThrough Lowes.com, Lowes.ca, ATGstores.com and mobile applications, we seek to empower consumers by providing a 24/7 shopping experience, online product information, customer ratings and reviews, online buying guides and how-to videos and other information. These tools help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions and give them increased confidence to undertake home improvement projects. In 2014, sales through our online selling channels, which include Lowes.com, Lowes.ca and ATGstores.com, accounted for approximately 2.5% of our total sales. We enable customers to choose from a variety of fulfillment options, including buying online and picking up in-store as well as delivery or parcel shipment to their homes.On-SiteWe have on-site specialists available to retail and Pro customers to assist them in selecting products and services for their projects. Our Account Executives ProServices meet with Pro customers at their place of business or on a job site and leverage stores within the area to ensure we meet customer needs for products and resources. Our Project Specialist Exteriors (PSE) program is available in all Lowe’s stores to discuss exterior projects such as roofing, siding, fencing, and windows, whose characteristics lend themselves to an in-home consultative sales approach. In addition, our Project Specialist Interiors (PSI) program is available in seven of our 14 regions to provide similar consultative services on interior projects such as kitchens and bathrooms. Contact CentersLowe’s operates two contact centers which are located in Wilkesboro, NC and Albuquerque, NM. In addition, we are opening an additional facility in Indianapolis, IN. These contact centers help enable an omni-channel experience by providing the ability to tender sales, coordinate deliveries, manage after-sale installations, facilitate repair services for Appliances and Outdoor Power Equipment, and answer general customer questions via phone, e-mail, letters, or social media.Employees As of January 30, 2015, we employed approximately 175,000 full-time and 91,000 part-time employees. Our employees in Mexico are subject to collective bargaining agreements. No other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Management considers its relations with employees to be good.Seasonality and Working CapitalThe retail business in general is subject to seasonal influences, and our business is, to some extent, seasonal. Historically, we have realized the highest volume of sales during our second fiscal quarter (May, June and July) and the lowest volume of sales during our fourth fiscal quarter (November, December and January). Accordingly, our working capital requirements have historically been greater during our fourth fiscal quarter as we build inventory in anticipation of the spring selling season and as we experience lower fourth fiscal quarter sales volumes. We fund our working capital requirements primarily through cash flows generated from operations, but also with short-term borrowings, as needed. For more detailed information, see the Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Intellectual PropertyThe name “Lowe’s” is a registered service mark of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We consider this mark and the accompanying name recognition to be valuable to our business. This subsidiary has various additional trademarks, trade names and service marks, many of which are used in our private brand program. The subsidiary also maintains various Internet domain names that are important to our business, and we also own registered and unregistered copyrights. In addition, we maintain patent portfolios related to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect certain innovations that we incorporate into our products, services, or business operations.7Table of ContentsEnvironmental Stewardship Lowe’s recognizes how efficient operations can help protect the environment and our bottom line. We examine our operations regularly to deliver energy efficiency, reduce fuel consumption, and minimize waste generation through increased recycling. We also install technology that will help us operate our facilities more efficiently and environmentally responsibly. For example, our RDC in Rome, GA was designed to use high-efficiency, light-emitting diode (LED) fixtures, and our Pittston RDC was retrofitted with interior and exterior LED fixtures, significantly reducing this facility's total energy use.We strive to deliver products to our stores in a fuel-efficient and an environmentally responsible manner through participation in the SmartWay® Transport Partnership, an innovative program launched by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2004 that promotes cleaner, more fuel-efficient transportation options. Lowe’s received a 2014 SmartWay Excellence Award from the EPA, our sixth consecutive SmartWay honor, for our commitment to environmental excellence in freight management operations and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and other harmful pollutants. We have also increased shipping of products by rail and increased the efficiency of truckload shipments to and from our RDCs. We continue to take steps to improve our recycling programs and reduce the amount of waste we generate. Through these efforts, we are able to reduce our disposal costs and minimize the impact on the environment of the operation of our stores and other facilities. We also offer convenient recycling for our customers at many of our stores for items such as rechargeable batteries, plastic bags and compact fluorescent light bulbs.We annually track our carbon footprint and participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project, an independent nonprofit organization hosting the largest database of primary corporate climate change information in the world. To further reduce our carbon footprint, we incorporate energy-efficient technologies and architectural systems into new stores and retrofits of existing stores, such as energy-efficient lighting, white membrane cool roofs, and HVAC units that meet or exceed ENERGY STAR qualifications. We also participate in demand response programs by voluntarily reducing our lighting and HVAC loads during peak demand periods to support electric grid reliability. Additionally, we continue to focus on helping consumers reduce their energy and water use and their environmental footprint while saving money when they purchase our products and services. We offer a wide selection of environmentally responsible and energy-efficient products for the home, including ENERGY STAR® appliances, WaterSense® labeled toilets, paint with no volatile organic compounds (VOC), and indoor and outdoor LED lighting. Through our in-home sales specialists, we offer customers installation of insulation and energy efficient windows.For more information on Lowe’s environmental efforts, please visit Lowes.com/SocialResponsibility.Compliance with Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations may increase our costs of doing business in a variety of ways, including indirectly through increased energy costs, as utilities, refineries, and other major emitters of greenhouse gases are subjected to additional regulation or legislation that seeks to better control greenhouse gas emissions. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2015 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with such laws or regulations. Reaching Out / Our CommunityLowe’s has a long and proud history of supporting local communities through public education and community improvement projects, beginning with the creation of the Lowe’s Charitable and Educational Foundation in 1957. In 2014, Lowe’s and the Lowe’s Charitable and Educational Foundation contributed $28 million to schools and community organizations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Our commitment to improving educational opportunities is best exemplified by our signature education grant program, Lowe’s Toolbox for Education®. The program has benefited more than five million schoolchildren since 2006, funding improvements at 1,103 schools across the United States in 2014. For more than a decade, we’ve been working with national nonprofit partners to strengthen and stabilize neighborhoods in the communities we serve. In 2014, Lowe’s contributed more than $6 million and teamed with Habitat for Humanity and Rebuilding Together to bring housing solutions and hope to families across the country. We also continued to build on our 8Table of Contentslongstanding partnerships with SkillsUSA, the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and Keep America Beautiful to improve communities and build tomorrow’s leaders. Lowe’s is also committed to helping residents of the communities we serve by being there when we’re needed most - when a natural disaster threatens and in the recovery that follows. In 2014, Lowe’s committed more than $2 million and mobilized hundreds of Lowe’s Heroes employee volunteers to help families recover from disasters in 12 states from the Pacific Northwest to New York, while helping others prepare for the threat of hurricanes in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey, and Texas.For more information on Lowe’s partnerships and latest community improvement projects, visit Lowes.com/SocialResponsibility and LowesInTheCommunity.tumblr.com.Available Information Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are made available free of charge through our internet website at www.Lowes.com/investor, as soon as reasonably practicable after such documents are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Economists generally expect the rate of home price growth to moderate to 3.2% in 2016.•Housing turnover increased an estimated 7.4% in 2015 after a 2.6% decrease in 2014, according to The National Association of Realtors and U.S. Census Bureau. Turnover is generally expected to continue to increase in 2016, supported by a strengthening jobs market, rising incomes, and historically low mortgage rates.These indicators are important to our business because they signal a customer’s willingness to engage in home maintenance, repair, and upgrade projects and favorably impact income available to purchase our products and services. Overall, the outlook for the home improvement industry remains positive for 2016. The lagged benefit of stronger home buying and continued home price appreciation should drive home improvement spending in 2016, offsetting moderation in job growth and the ongoing potential pressure on mortgage rates. Our CompetitionThe home improvement industry includes a broad competitive landscape. We compete with other home improvement warehouse chains and lumberyards in most of our trade areas. We also compete with traditional hardware, plumbing, electrical and home supply retailers. In addition, we compete with general merchandise retailers, warehouse clubs, and online and other specialty retailers as well as service providers that install home improvement products. Location of stores continues to be a key competitive factor in our industry; however, the increasing use of technology and the simplicity of online shopping also underscore the importance of omni-channel capabilities as a competitive factor. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing better customer experiences while delivering superior value in products and service. See further discussion of competition in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Products and ServicesOur ProductsProduct SelectionTo meet customers’ varying home improvement needs, we offer a complete line of products for maintenance, repair, remodeling, and decorating. We offer home improvement products in the following categories: Lumber & Building Materials; Tools & Hardware; Appliances; Fashion Fixtures; Rough Plumbing & Electrical; Lawn & Garden; Seasonal Living; Paint; Flooring; Millwork; Kitchens; Outdoor Power Equipment, and Home Fashions. A typical Lowe’s home improvement store stocks approximately 36,000 items, with hundreds of thousands of additional items available through our Special Order Sales system, Lowes.com, Lowes.ca, and ATGstores.com. See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for historical revenues by product category for each of the last three fiscal years.We are committed to offering a wide selection of national brand-name merchandise complemented by our selection of private brands. In addition, we are dedicated to ensuring the products we sell are sourced in a socially responsible, efficient, and cost effective manner.National Brand-Name MerchandiseIn many product categories, customers look for a familiar and trusted national brand to instill confidence in their purchase. Lowe’s home improvement stores carry a wide selection of national brand-name merchandise such as Whirlpool® appliances and water heaters, GE®, LG®, and Samsung® appliances, Stainmaster® carpets, Valspar® paints and stains, Pella® windows and doors, Sylvania® light bulbs, Dewalt® power tools, Owens Corning® roofing, Johns Manville® insulation, James Hardie® fiber cement siding, Husqvarna® outdoor power equipment, Werner® ladders, and many more. In 2015, we added brand name merchandise such as HGTV HOME® by Sherwin-Williams® paints, Kichler® lighting, Owens Corning® insulation, GAF® roofing, and Diamond® vanities to our portfolio. Our merchandise selection provides the retail and Pro customer a one-stop shop for a wide variety of national brand-name merchandise needed to complete home improvement, repair, maintenance, or construction projects.5Table of ContentsPrivate BrandsPrivate brands are an important element of our overall portfolio, helping to provide significant value and coordinated style across core categories. We sell private brands in several of our product categories. Some of Lowe’s most important private brands include Kobalt® tools, allen+roth® home décor products, Blue Hawk® home improvement products, Project Source® basic value products, Portfolio® lighting products, Garden Treasures® lawn and patio products, Utilitech® electrical and utility products, Reliabilt® doors and windows, Aquasource® faucets, sinks and toilets, Harbor Breeze® ceiling fans, Top Choice® lumber products and Iris® home automation and management products.Supply ChainWe source our products from over 7,500 vendors worldwide with no single vendor accounting for more than 6% of total purchases. We believe that alternative and competitive suppliers are available for virtually all of our products. Whenever possible, we purchase directly from manufacturers to provide savings for customers and improve our gross margin.To efficiently move product from our vendors to our stores and maintain in-stock levels, we own and operate distribution facilities that enable products to be received from vendors, stored and picked, or cross-docked, and then shipped to our retail locations or directly to customers. These facilities include 15 highly-automated Regional Distribution Centers (RDC) in the United States. On average, each domestic RDC serves approximately 115 stores. We also own and operate a distribution facility to serve our Canadian stores and lease and operate a distribution facility to serve our Orchard stores. Additionally, we have a service agreement with a third party logistics provider to manage a distribution facility to serve our stores in Mexico.In addition to the RDCs, we also operate coastal holding facilities, transload facilities, appliance distribution centers, and flatbed distribution centers. The flatbed distribution centers distribute merchandise that requires special handling due to size or type of packaging such as lumber, boards, panel products, pipe, siding, ladders, and building materials. Collectively, our facilities enable our import and e-commerce, as well as parcel post eligible products, to get to their destination as efficiently as possible. Most parcel post items can be ordered by a customer and delivered within two business days at standard shipping rates.In fiscal 2015, on average, approximately 80% of the total dollar amount of stock merchandise we purchased was shipped through our distribution network, while the remaining portion was shipped directly to our stores from vendors.Our ServicesInstalled SalesWe offer installation services through independent contractors in many of our product categories, with Appliances, Flooring, Kitchens, Lumber & Building Materials, and Millwork accounting for the majority of installed sales. Our Installed Sales model, which separates selling and project administration tasks, allows our sales associates to focus on project selling, while project managers ensure that the details related to installing the products are efficiently executed. Installed Sales, which includes both product and labor, accounted for approximately 8% of total sales in fiscal 2015.Extended Protection Plans and Repair ServicesWe offer extended protection plans in Kitchens, Appliances, Tools & Hardware, Outdoor Power Equipment, Seasonal Living, and Rough Plumbing. Lowe’s protection plans provide customers with product protection that enhances or extends coverage previously offered by the manufacturer’s warranty. Our extended protection plans provide in-warranty and out-of-warranty repair services for major appliances, outdoor power equipment, tools, grills, fireplaces, water heaters, and other eligible products through our stores or in the home through our Lowe’s Authorized Service Repair Network. We offer replacement plans for products in most of these categories when priced below $200, or otherwise specified category specific price points. Our contact center takes customers’ calls, assesses the problems, and facilitates resolutions, making after-sales service easier for our customers because we manage the entire process.Selling ChannelsWe are continuing our progress towards becoming an omni-channel retail company, which allows our customers to move from channel to channel with simple and seamless transitions even within the same transaction. For example, for many projects, more than half of our customers conduct research online before making an in-store purchase. For purchases made on Lowes.com, approximately 60% are picked up in-store, 10% are delivered from a store, and 30% are parcel shipped. Regardless of the channels through which customers choose to engage with us, we strive to provide them with a seamless experience across channels and an endless aisle of products, enabled by our flexible fulfillment capabilities. Our ability to sell products in-store, online, on-site, or through our contact centers speaks to our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure with the omni-channel capabilities we continue to introduce.6Table of ContentsIn-StoreOur 1,777 home improvement stores are generally open seven days per week and average approximately 112,000 square feet of retail selling space, plus approximately 32,000 square feet of outdoor garden center selling space. In addition, we operate 80 Orchard hardware stores located throughout California and Oregon that also serve home improvement customers and average approximately 37,000 square feet of retail selling space. Our home improvement stores offer similar products and services, with certain variations based on local market factors; however, Orchard stores are primarily focused on paint, repair, and backyard products. We continue to develop and implement tools to make our sales associates more efficient and to integrate our order management and fulfillment processes. Our home improvement stores have Wi-Fi capabilities that provide customers with internet access, making information available quickly to further simplify the shopping experience. OnlineThrough Lowes.com, Lowes.ca, ATGstores.com and mobile applications, we seek to empower consumers by providing a 24/7 shopping experience, online product information, customer ratings and reviews, online buying guides and how-to videos and other information. These tools help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions and give them increased confidence to undertake home improvement projects. In 2015, sales through our online selling channels accounted for approximately 3% of our total sales. We enable customers to choose from a variety of fulfillment options, including buying online and picking up in-store as well as delivery or parcel shipment to their homes.In addition, during 2015 we re-launched the LowesForPros.com online tool. This full omni-channel experience allows for easy online ordering for our Pro customers, and their choice of in-store pick-up or delivery, saving them time and money.On-SiteWe have on-site specialists available for retail and Pro customers to assist them in selecting products and services for their projects. Our Account Executives ProServices meet with Pro customers at their place of business or on a job site and leverage stores within the area to ensure we meet customer needs for products and resources. Our Project Specialist Exteriors (PSE) program is available in all Lowe’s stores to discuss exterior projects such as roofing, siding, fencing, and windows, whose characteristics lend themselves to an in-home consultative sales approach. In addition, our Project Specialist Interiors (PSI) program is available in 11 of our 14 regions to provide similar consultative services on interior projects such as kitchens and bathrooms. Contact CentersLowe’s operates three contact centers which are located in Wilkesboro, NC, Albuquerque, NM, and Indianapolis, IN. These contact centers help Lowe’s enable an omni-channel customer experience by providing the ability to tender sales, coordinate deliveries, manage after-sale installations, facilitate repair services for Appliances and Outdoor Power Equipment, and answer general customer questions via phone, e-mail, letters, and social media.Employees As of January 29, 2016, we employed approximately 180,000 full-time and 90,000 part-time employees. Our employees in Mexico are subject to collective bargaining agreements. No other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Management considers its relations with employees to be good.Seasonality and Working CapitalThe retail business in general is subject to seasonal influences, and our business is, to some extent, seasonal. Historically, we have realized the highest volume of sales during our second fiscal quarter (May, June and July) and the lowest volume of sales during our fourth fiscal quarter (November, December and January). Accordingly, our working capital requirements have historically been greater during our fourth fiscal quarter as we build inventory in anticipation of the spring selling season and as we experience lower fourth fiscal quarter sales volumes. We fund our working capital requirements primarily through cash flows generated from operations, but also with short-term borrowings, as needed. For more detailed information, see the Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Intellectual PropertyThe name “Lowe’s” is a registered service mark of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We consider this mark and the accompanying name recognition to be valuable to our business. This subsidiary has various additional trademarks, trade names and service marks, many of which are used in our private brand program. The subsidiary also maintains various Internet 7Table of Contentsdomain names that are important to our business, and we also own registered and unregistered copyrights. In addition, we maintain patent portfolios related to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect certain innovations that we incorporate into our products, services, or business operations.Environmental Stewardship Lowe’s recognizes how efficient operations can help protect the environment and our bottom line. We examine our operations regularly to deliver energy efficiency, reduce fuel consumption, and minimize waste generation through increased recycling. We also invest in technology that will help us operate our facilities more efficiently and environmentally responsibly. We annually track our carbon footprint and participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project, an independent nonprofit organization hosting the largest database of primary corporate climate change information in the world. To further reduce our carbon footprint, we incorporate energy-efficient technologies and architectural systems into new stores and retrofits of existing stores, such as energy-efficient lighting, white membrane cool roofs, and HVAC units that meet or exceed ENERGY STAR qualifications. We also participate in demand response programs by voluntarily reducing our lighting and HVAC loads during peak demand periods to support electric grid reliability. During 2015, we began testing a state-of-the-art building management system in stores to control lighting, air conditioning and other building systems. We also implemented a light-emitting diode (LED) lighting initiative in select markets and new stores. All light sources for new stores constructed in the future will be LED.We strive to deliver products to our stores in a fuel-efficient and an environmentally responsible manner through participation in the SmartWay® Transport Partnership, an innovative program launched by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2004 that promotes cleaner, more fuel-efficient transportation options. Lowe’s received a 2015 SmartWay Excellence Award from the EPA, our seventh consecutive SmartWay honor, for our commitment to environmental excellence in freight management operations and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and other harmful pollutants. We have also increased shipping of products by rail and increased the efficiency of truckload shipments to and from our RDCs. We continue to take steps to improve our recycling programs and reduce the amount of waste we generate. Through these efforts, we are able to reduce our disposal costs and minimize the impact on the environment of the operation of our stores and other facilities. We also offer convenient recycling for our customers at many of our stores for items such as rechargeable batteries, plastic bags and compact fluorescent light bulbs.Additionally, we continue to focus on helping consumers reduce their energy and water use and their environmental footprint while saving money when they purchase our products and services. We offer a wide selection of environmentally responsible and energy-efficient products for the home, including ENERGY STAR® appliances, WaterSense® labeled toilets, paint with no volatile organic compounds (VOC), and indoor and outdoor LED lighting. Through our in-home sales specialists, we offer customers installation of insulation and energy efficient windows.For more information on Lowe’s environmental efforts, please visit Lowes.com/SocialResponsibility.Compliance with Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations may increase our costs of doing business in a variety of ways, including indirectly through increased energy costs, as utilities, refineries, and other major emitters of greenhouse gases are subjected to additional regulation or legislation that seeks to better control greenhouse gas emissions. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2016 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with such laws or regulations. Investing in Our CommunitiesLowe’s has a long and proud history of supporting local communities through public education and community improvement projects, beginning with the creation of the Lowe’s Charitable and Educational Foundation in 1957. In 2015, Lowe’s and the Lowe’s Charitable and Educational Foundation donated more than $33 million to schools and community organizations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.Our commitment to improving educational opportunities is best exemplified by our signature education grant program, Lowe’s Toolbox for Education®, and 2015 marked the program’s 10-year anniversary. Since its inception, Lowe’s Toolbox for 8Table of ContentsEducation has provided approximately $48 million in grants, funding improvements at nearly 11,000 schools and benefiting more than six million children along the way.Each year, we work with national nonprofit partners to strengthen and stabilize neighborhoods in the communities we serve. In 2015, Lowe’s contributed $7 million and teamed with Habitat for Humanity and Rebuilding Together to provide housing solutions in partnership with families across the country. We also continued to build on our longstanding partnerships with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, SkillsUSA, The Nature Conservancy, and Keep America Beautiful to improve communities and build tomorrow’s leaders. Lowe’s is also committed to helping residents of the communities we serve by being there when we’re needed most - when a natural disaster threatens and in the recovery that follows. In 2015, Lowe’s donated nearly $1.5 million and mobilized hundreds of Lowe’s Heroes employee volunteers to help families recover from disasters across the United States.Altogether, Lowe’s completed 3,795 community improvement projects in 2015. And for the first time, every single Lowe’s store in the United States participated in a Lowe’s Heroes volunteer project.For more information on Lowe’s partnerships and latest community improvement projects, visit Lowes.com/SocialResponsibility and LowesInTheCommunity.tumblr.com.Available Information Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are made available free of charge through our internet website at www.Lowes.com/investor, as soon as reasonably practicable after such documents are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

For additional information about the Company’s performance and financial condition, see also Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, of this Annual Report.Customers, Market and CompetitionOur CustomersWe serve homeowners, renters, and professional customers (Pro customers). Retail customers, comprised of individual homeowners and renters, complete a wide array of projects and vary along the spectrum of do-it-yourself (DIY) and do-it-for-me (DIFM). The Pro customer consists of two broad categories: construction trades; and maintenance, repair & operations.Our Market The U.S. market remains our predominant market, accounting for approximately 94% of consolidated sales as of February 3, 2017. We are among the many businesses, including home centers, paint stores, hardware stores, lumber yards and garden centers, whose revenues are included in the Building Material and Garden Equipment and Supplies Dealers Subsector (444) of the Retail Trade Sector of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), the standard used by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and publishing statistical data related to the U.S. business economy. The total annual revenue reported for businesses included in NAICS 444 in 2016 was $352.3 billion, which represented an increase of 5.9% over the amount reported for the same category in 2015. The total annual revenue reported for businesses included in NAICS 444 in 2015 was $332.6 billion, which represented an increase of 4.7% over the amount reported for the same category in 2014. These figures are subject to periodic revision by the U.S. Department of Commerce.NAICS 444 represents less than half of what we consider the total U.S. market for our products and services. The broader market in which Lowe’s operates includes home-related sales through a variety of companies beyond those in NAICS 444. These consist of other companies in the retail sector, including mass retailers, home furnishings stores, and online retailers, as well as wholesalers that provide home-related products and services to homeowners, businesses, and the government. Based on our analysis of the most recent comprehensive data available, we estimate the size of the U.S. home improvement market at $775 billion in 2016, comprised of $578 billion of product sales and $197 billion of installed labor sales. That compares with $730 billion total market sales in 2015, comprised of $543 billion of product sales and $187 billion of installed labor sales. These figures are subject to periodic revision by the U.S. Department of Commerce and other third-party sources. There are many variables that affect consumer demand for the home improvement products and services Lowe’s offers. Key indicators we monitor include real disposable personal income, employment, home prices, and housing turnover. We also monitor demographic and societal trends that shape home improvement industry growth. 4Table of Contents•Growth in real disposable personal income is projected to moderate to 2.3% in 2017 as compared with 2.8% growth in 2016, based on the March 2017 Blue Chip Economic Indicators®. * •The average unemployment rate for 2017 is forecasted to decline to 4.6%, according to the March 2017 Blue Chip Economic Indicators, which would be an improvement from the 4.9% average rate in 2016. The unemployment rate should continue to trend lower as the job market continues to expand at a moderate pace.•Recent evidence suggests that home prices will continue to increase. In 2016, home prices increased an estimated 5.4% similar to the 5.5% increase in 2015, according to the latest Federal Housing Finance Agency index. Economists generally expect the rate of home price growth to moderate in 2017.•Housing turnover increased an estimated 5.1% in 2016 after a 7.3% increase in 2015, according to The National Association of Realtors and U.S. Census Bureau. Turnover is generally expected to continue to moderately increase in 2017, supported by persisting growth in the job market, rising incomes, and historically low mortgage rates.These indicators are important to our business because they signal a customer’s willingness to engage in home maintenance, repair, and upgrade projects and favorably impact income available to purchase our products and services. Overall, the outlook for the home improvement industry remains positive for 2017, supported by continuing gains in jobs and incomes, home buying, and home price appreciation.*Blue Chip Economic Indicators® (ISSN: 0193-4600) is published monthly by Aspen Publishers, 76 Ninth Avenue, New York, NY 10011, a division of Wolters Kluwer Law and Business.

We continue to develop and implement tools to make our sales associates more efficient and to integrate our order management and fulfillment processes. Our home improvement stores have Wi-Fi capabilities that provide customers with internet access, making information available quickly to further simplify the shopping experience. OnlineThrough our websites and mobile applications, we seek to empower consumers by providing a 24/7 shopping experience, online product information, customer ratings and reviews, online buying guides and how-to videos and other information. These tools help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions and give them increased confidence to undertake home improvement projects. In 2016, sales through our online selling channels accounted for approximately 3.5% of our total sales. We enable customers to choose from a variety of fulfillment options, including buying online and picking up in-store as well as delivery or parcel shipment to their homes.In addition, our LowesForPros.com online tool allows for easy online ordering for our Pro customers, and their choice of in-store pick-up or delivery, saving them time and money.On-SiteWe have on-site specialists available for retail and Pro customers to assist them in selecting products and services for their projects. Our Account Executives ProServices meet with Pro customers at their place of business or on a job site and leverage stores within the area to ensure we meet customer needs for products and resources. Our Project Specialist Exteriors (PSE) program is available in all U.S. Lowe’s home improvement stores to discuss exterior projects such as roofing, siding, fencing, and windows, whose characteristics lend themselves to an in-home consultative sales approach. In addition, our Project Specialist Interiors (PSI) program is also now available in all U.S. Lowe’s home improvement stores to provide similar consultative services on interior projects such as kitchens and bathrooms. Contact CentersLowe’s operates three contact centers which are located in Wilkesboro, NC, Albuquerque, NM, and Indianapolis, IN. These contact centers help Lowe’s enable an omni-channel customer experience by providing the ability to tender sales, coordinate deliveries, manage after-sale installations, facilitate repair services for Appliances and Outdoor Power Equipment, and answer general customer questions via phone, mail, e-mail, live chat, and social media.Employees As of February 3, 2017, we employed approximately 190,000 full-time and 100,000 part-time employees. Our employees in Mexico, and certain employees in Canada, are subject to collective bargaining agreements. No other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Management considers its relations with employees to be good.Seasonality and Working CapitalThe retail business in general is subject to seasonal influences, and our business is, to some extent, seasonal. Historically, we have realized the highest volume of sales during our second fiscal quarter (May, June and July) and the lowest volume of sales during our fourth fiscal quarter (November, December and January). Accordingly, our working capital requirements have historically been greater during our fourth fiscal quarter as we build inventory in anticipation of the spring selling season and as we experience lower fourth fiscal quarter sales volumes. We fund our working capital requirements primarily through cash 7Table of Contentsflows generated from operations, but also with short-term borrowings, as needed. For more detailed information, see the Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, of this Annual Report.Intellectual PropertyThe name “Lowe’s” is a registered service mark of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We consider this mark and the accompanying name recognition to be valuable to our business. This subsidiary and other wholly owned subsidiaries own and maintain various additional registered and unregistered trademarks, trade names and service marks, including but not limited to retail names “RONA”, “Reno Depot”, and “Orchard Supply Hardware”, online retail name “ATG Stores”, and private brand product names “Kobalt” and “allen+roth”. These subsidiaries also maintain various Internet domain names that are important to our business, and we also own registered and unregistered copyrights. In addition, we maintain patent portfolios related to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect certain innovations that we incorporate into our products, services, or business operations.Environmental Stewardship Lowe’s knows that operating a business can impact the environment and our communities, and we continue to work to positively influence that impact. It is a responsibility we take seriously.In 2016, we created a Sustainability & Product Stewardship Council, led by senior executives, to review significant strategies and policies regarding sustainability and product stewardship, and make recommendations across the organization. The company initiated work on a comprehensive sustainability strategy that creates business value and supports our purpose, and we expect to finalize that strategy during 2017. Each year, Lowe’s participates in the Carbon Disclosure Project to track our carbon footprint. In 2016, Lowe’s externally verified its greenhouse gas emissions data collection and analysis to validate our findings and increase confidence in our reporting. In 2016, 32 retail locations upgraded to interior light-emitting diode (LED) lighting, and seven new stores opened with LED lighting already installed. We plan to continue to implement interior LED lighting and seek solutions for specific lighting needs to enhance energy efficiency as well as the customer experience. In 2016, we expanded our test of a state-of-the-art building management system (BMS) to 100 stores. The BMS monitors equipment performance and provides valuable information that helps facility managers manage energy consumption to reduce costs and carbon emissions. Lowe’s conducted energy efficiency audits of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, and will be implementing upgrades to a number of systems in 2017. Lowe’s is committed to promoting sustainable practices in the transportation industry. We collaborate with the Environmental Protection Agency’s SmartWay program to reduce transportation emissions by creating incentives for freight contractors to improve efficiency, and are proud to be one of only nine companies in 2016 to receive the Environmental Protection Agency SmartWay Excellence Award in the logistics and shipping category-the only retailer to achieve this honor eight years in a row.Our recycling program continues to be a priority as we seek to reduce landfill waste and increase recycling at our stores and distribution centers. We operate in-store recycling centers at every Lowe’s store in the continental United States, encouraging customers to recycle compact fluorescent lamps, plastic bags, rechargeable batteries and cell phones. We offer haul-away service to customers who purchase replacement appliances, and our Garden Centers also accept plastic plant trays and pots for recycling.Managing our water resources is essential in regions experiencing drought conditions. In 2016, we installed HydroPoint irrigation technology that combines real-time weather data with site-specific information to reduce water consumption and save on utility costs. The systems are in 200 locations and we expect to expand to 200 more in the coming year. More than ever, customers expect products that are safe, socially and environmentally responsible, and also affordable. Lowe’s increasingly provides product choices that save energy and water, reduce potentially harmful chemicals, or mitigate safety concerns for their families. We also engage with our product suppliers, manufacturers and other external stakeholders to ensure we carry the most innovative new products.For more information about Lowe’s environmental efforts, please visit Lowes.com/SocialResponsibility.8Table of ContentsInvesting in Our CommunitiesLowe’s has a long and proud history of supporting local communities through public education and community improvement projects, beginning with the creation of the Lowe’s Charitable and Educational Foundation in 1957. In 2016, Lowe’s and the Lowe’s Charitable and Educational Foundation donated approximately $38 million to schools and community organizations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, including but not limited to the following discussed below.Our commitment to improving educational opportunities is best exemplified by our signature education grant program, Lowe’s Toolbox for Education®, and 2016 marked the program’s 11-year anniversary.

For additional information about the Company’s performance and financial condition, see also Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, of this Annual Report. Financial information about our geographic areas is included in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, of this Annual Report.Customers, Market and CompetitionOur CustomersWe serve homeowners, renters, and professional customers (Pro customers). Individual homeowners and renters complete a wide array of projects and vary along the spectrum of do-it-yourself (DIY) and do-it-for-me (DIFM). The Pro customer consists of two broad categories: construction trades; and maintenance, repair & operations.Our MarketThe U.S. market remains our predominant market, accounting for approximately 92% of consolidated sales for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2018. We are among the many businesses, including home centers, paint stores, hardware stores, lumber yards and garden centers, whose revenues are included in the Building Material and Garden Equipment and Supplies Dealers Subsector (444) of the Retail Trade Sector of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), the standard used by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and publishing statistical data related to the U.S. business economy. NAICS 444 represents roughly half of what we consider the total U.S. market for our products and services. The broader market in which Lowe’s operates includes home-related sales through a variety of companies beyond those in NAICS 444. These consist of other companies in the retail sector, including mass retailers, home goods specialty stores, and online retailers, as well as wholesalers that provide home-related products and services to homeowners, businesses, and the government. There are many variables that affect consumer demand for the home improvement products and services Lowe’s offers. Key indicators we monitor include real disposable personal income, employment, home prices, and housing turnover. We also monitor demographic and societal trends that shape home improvement industry growth. Our CompetitionThe home improvement industry includes a broad competitive landscape. We compete with other national and international home improvement warehouse chains and lumberyards in most of our trade areas. We also compete with traditional hardware, plumbing, electrical, home supply retailers, and maintenance and repair organizations. In addition, we compete with general merchandise retailers, warehouse clubs, and online and other specialty retailers as well as service providers that install home 4Table of Contentsimprovement products. Location of stores continues to be a key competitive factor in our industry; however, the increasing use of technology and the simplicity of online shopping also underscore the importance of omni-channel capabilities as a competitive factor. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing better customer experiences while delivering superior value in products and service. See further discussion of competition in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, of this Annual Report. Products and ServicesOur ProductsProduct SelectionTo meet customers’ varying home improvement needs, we offer a complete line of products for maintenance, repair, remodeling, and decorating. We offer home improvement products in the following categories: Lumber & Building Materials, Tools & Hardware, Appliances, Fashion Fixtures, Rough Plumbing & Electrical, Seasonal & Outdoor Living, Lawn & Garden, Paint, Millwork, Flooring, and Kitchens. A typical Lowe’s-branded home improvement store stocks approximately 39,000 items, with hundreds of thousands of additional items available through our Special Order Sales system and various online selling channels. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, of this Annual Report for historical revenues by product category for each of the last three fiscal years. We are committed to offering a wide selection of national brand-name merchandise complemented by our selection of private brands. In addition, we are dedicated to ensuring the products we sell are sourced in a socially responsible, efficient, and cost effective manner.National Brand-Name MerchandiseIn many product categories, customers look for a familiar and trusted national brand to instill confidence in their purchase. Lowe’s home improvement stores carry a wide selection of national brand-name merchandise such as Whirlpool®, GE®, LG®, and Samsung® appliances, Stainmaster® carpets, Sherwin-Williams® paints and stains, Valspar® paints and stains, Pella® windows and doors, Pergo® hardwood flooring, Dewalt® power tools, Hitachi® pneumatic tools, Weber® grills, Char-Broil® grills, Owens Corning® insulation and roofing, GAF® roofing, James Hardie® fiber cement siding, Marshalltown® masonry tools and concrete, Husqvarna® outdoor power equipment, John Deere® riding lawn mowers, Werner® ladders, Quoizel® lighting, Nest® products and many more.

Our merchandise selection provides the retail and Pro customer a one-stop shop for a wide variety of national brand-name merchandise needed to complete home improvement, repair, maintenance, or construction projects.Private BrandsPrivate brands are an important element of our overall portfolio, helping to provide significant value and coordinated style across core categories. We sell private brands in several of our product categories. Some of Lowe’s most important private brands include Kobalt® tools, allen+roth® home décor products, Blue Hawk® home improvement products, Project Source® basic value products, Portfolio® lighting products, Garden Treasures® lawn and patio products, Utilitech® electrical and utility products, Reliabilt® doors and windows, Aquasource® faucets, sinks and toilets, Harbor Breeze® ceiling fans, Top Choice® lumber products and Iris® home automation and management products.Supply ChainWe source our products from vendors worldwide and believe that alternative and competitive suppliers are available for virtually all of our products. Whenever possible, we purchase directly from manufacturers to provide savings for customers and improve our gross margin.To efficiently move product from our vendors to our stores and maintain in-stock levels, we own and operate distribution facilities that enable products to be received from vendors, stored and picked, or cross-docked, and then shipped to our retail locations or directly to customers. These facilities include 15 highly-automated Regional Distribution Centers (RDC) in the United States. On average, each domestic RDC serves approximately 118 stores. We also own and operate eight distribution centers, including four lumber yards, to serve our Canadian market, and we lease and operate a distribution facility to serve our Orchard stores. Additionally, we have a service agreement with a third-party logistics provider to manage a distribution facility to serve our stores in Mexico.In addition to the RDCs, we also operate coastal holding facilities, transload facilities, appliance distribution centers, and flatbed distribution centers. The flatbed distribution centers distribute merchandise that requires special handling due to size or type of packaging such as lumber, boards, panel products, pipe, siding, ladders, and building materials. Collectively, our 5Table of Contentsfacilities enable our import and e-commerce, as well as parcel post eligible products, to get to their destination as efficiently as possible. Most parcel post items can be ordered by a customer and delivered within two business days at standard shipping rates.In fiscal 2017, on average, approximately 80% of the total dollar amount of stock merchandise we purchased was shipped through our distribution network, while the remaining portion was shipped directly to our stores from vendors.Our ServicesInstalled SalesWe offer installation services through independent contractors in many of our product categories, with Appliances, Flooring, Kitchens, Lumber & Building Materials, and Millwork accounting for the majority of installed sales. Our Installed Sales model, which separates selling and project administration tasks, allows our sales associates to focus on project selling, while project managers ensure that the details related to installing the products are efficiently executed. Installed Sales, which includes both product and labor, accounted for approximately 7% of total sales in fiscal 2017.Extended Protection Plans and Repair ServicesWe offer extended protection plans for various products within the Appliances, Kitchens, Fashion Fixtures, Millwork, Rough Plumbing & Electrical, Seasonal & Outdoor Living, and Tools & Hardware categories. These protection plans provide customers with product protection that enhances or extends coverage previously offered by the manufacturer’s warranty, and provides additional customer friendly benefits that go beyond the scope of a manufacturer’s warranty. The protection plans provide in-warranty and out-of-warranty repair services for major appliances, outdoor power equipment, tools, grills, fireplaces, air conditioners, water heaters, and other eligible products through our stores or in the home through the Lowe’s Authorized Service Repair Network. We offer replacement plans for products in most of these categories when priced below $300, or otherwise specified category specific price points. Our contact center takes customers’ calls, assesses the problems, and facilitates resolutions, making after-sales service easier for our customers by managing the entire process.Selling ChannelsWe are continuing to enhance our omni-channel capabilities, which allows our customers to move from channel to channel with simple and seamless transitions even within the same transaction. For example, for many projects, more than half of our customers conduct research online before making an in-store purchase. For purchases made on Lowes.com, customers may pick up their purchase in-store, have their purchase delivered from a store, or have their purchase parcel shipped. In addition, flexible fulfillment options are available for in-store purchases and those made through the contact center. Regardless of the channels through which customers choose to engage with us, we strive to provide them with a seamless experience across channels and an endless aisle of products, enabled by our flexible fulfillment capabilities. Our ability to sell products in-store, online, on-site, or through our contact centers speaks to our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure with the omni-channel capabilities we continue to introduce.In-StoreOur 1,813 Lowe’s-branded home improvement stores, inclusive of 1,740 in the U.S., 63 in Canada and 10 in Mexico, are generally open seven days per week and average approximately 112,000 square feet of retail selling space, plus approximately 32,000 square feet of outdoor garden center selling space.

These subsidiaries also maintain various Internet domain names that are important to our business, and we also own registered and unregistered copyrights. In addition, we maintain patent portfolios related to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect certain innovations that we incorporate into our products, services, or business operations.Environmental Stewardship As a purpose-driven, principles-based company, Lowe’s is committed to leveraging our time, talents and resources to growing in a way that makes our world better, makes our communities stronger, and makes people want to connect with us as their partner in home improvement. In 2017, our Sustainability & Product Stewardship Council, led by senior executives, enhanced our Corporate Social Responsibility Strategy. Our strategy focuses on responsible sourcing, safer and more eco-friendly product offerings, maintaining a diverse, healthy, engaged and skilled workforce, supporting our local communities and operating ethically and responsibly. We want our customers to feel good about the high-quality products they choose at Lowe’s. Our products are selected very 7Table of Contentscarefully, beginning with our sourcing decisions. We care about how our thousands of products are created and about the people who make them. Through collaboration and established management systems, we monitor our suppliers’ practices to ensure we are securing high quality products from suppliers who protect worker rights and the environment. We are also bringing innovative, efficient and eco-certified products into our portfolio-products that provide health and environmental benefits-to meet the needs of an increasing set of customers who prefer these types of products. In 2017, we crafted vision statements and began identifying 2025 goals to guide our future decisions.We are committed to preserving our shared home, Earth, through sustainable practices and conservation at a local level. Our retail stores require significant amounts of electricity to operate lighting, HVAC and other energy-consuming items, while the transportation of our products from suppliers, to distribution centers to stores requires fuel. We are actively working to manage and reduce energy and fuel usage. At a local level, store waste can add up-cardboard, broken appliances, wood pallets, and more. We recycle these through national and regional partners and provide in-store recycling centers for our customers to bring in certain items. Footprint reduction activities result in cost savings, healthier communities and a better world.Each year, Lowe’s participates in the Carbon Disclosure Project to track our carbon footprint. In 2017, Lowe’s externally verified its greenhouse gas emissions data collection and analysis to validate our findings and increase confidence in our reporting. In 2017, 100 retail locations upgraded to interior light-emitting diode (LED) lighting. In 2017, we also replaced 100 aging HVAC units with high-efficiency units and added Variable Fan Drive systems in over 300 stores. During the execution of the HVAC initiative, the facilities team was able to recycle over four million pounds of materials, preventing valuable resources from going to landfill. Lowe’s is committed to promoting sustainable practices in the transportation industry. We collaborate with the Environmental Protection Agency’s SmartWay program to reduce transportation emissions by creating incentives for freight contractors to improve efficiency, and are proud to be the only retailer to achieve the Environmental Protection Agency SmartWay Excellence Award nine years in a row.Managing our water resources is essential in regions experiencing drought conditions. In 2017, we completed our rollout of HydroPoint irrigation technology that combines real-time weather data with site-specific information to reduce water consumption and save on utility costs. The HydroPoint systems are now deployed to approximately 925 locations, covering all stores with operable irrigation systems.For more information about Lowe’s environmental efforts, please visit Lowes.com/SocialResponsibility.Investing in Our CommunitiesLowe’s has a long and proud history of supporting local communities through volunteerism as well as public education and community improvement projects, beginning with the creation of the Lowe’s Charitable and Educational Foundation in 1957. In 2017, Lowe’s employees contributed approximately 200,000 hours to Lowe’s Heroes volunteer projects, with 100% participation from Lowe’s U.S. stores. Lowe’s and the Lowe’s Charitable and Educational Foundation donated approximately $39 million to schools and community organizations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, including but not limited to the following actions discussed below.Our commitment to improving educational opportunities is best exemplified by our signature education grant program, Lowe’s Toolbox for Education®, and 2017 marked the program’s 12-year anniversary. In 2017, Lowe’s Toolbox for Education® provided approximately $6.5 million in grants and since inception has provided funding improvements at nearly 13,000 schools, benefiting more than seven million children.Each year, we work with national nonprofit partners to strengthen and stabilize neighborhoods in the communities we serve.

In 2017, Lowe’s contributed more than $2.5 million and mobilized hundreds of employee volunteers to help families recover from disasters across the United States. We also supported our employees affected by the many natural disasters this year by doubling the company match of the Employee Relief Fund after Harvey made landfall. Together, Lowe’s and our generous employees raised over $3.1 million this year which has helped over 2,500 employees in need. 8Table of ContentsFor more information on Lowe’s partnerships and latest community improvement projects, visit Lowes.com/SocialResponsibility.Available Information Our Annual Report, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are made available free of charge through our internet website at www.Lowes.com/investor, as soon as reasonably practicable after such documents are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

For additional information about the Company’s performance and financial condition, see also Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, of this Annual Report. Customers, Market and CompetitionOur CustomersWe serve homeowners, renters, and professional customers (Pro customers). Individual homeowners and renters complete a wide array of projects and vary along the spectrum of do-it-yourself (DIY) and do-it-for-me (DIFM). The Pro customer consists of two broad categories: construction trades; and maintenance, repair & operations.Our MarketThe U.S. market remains our predominant market, accounting for approximately 92% of consolidated sales for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2019. We are among the many businesses, including home centers, paint stores, hardware stores, lumber yards and garden centers, whose revenues are included in the Building Material and Garden Equipment and Supplies Dealers Subsector (444) of the Retail Trade Sector of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), the standard used by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and publishing statistical data related to the U.S. business economy. NAICS 444 represents roughly half of what we consider the total U.S. market for our products and services. The broader market in which Lowe’s operates includes home-related sales through a variety of companies beyond those in NAICS 444. These consist of other companies in the retail sector, including mass retailers, home goods specialty stores, and online retailers, as well as wholesalers that provide home-related products and services to homeowners, businesses, and the government. There are many variables that affect consumer demand for the home improvement products and services Lowe’s offers. Key indicators we monitor include real disposable personal income, employment, home prices, and housing turnover. We also monitor demographic and societal trends that shape home improvement industry growth. Our CompetitionThe home improvement industry includes a broad competitive landscape. We compete with other national and international home improvement warehouse chains and lumberyards in most of our trade areas. We also compete with traditional hardware, plumbing, electrical, home supply retailers, and maintenance and repair organizations. In addition, we compete with general merchandise retailers, warehouse clubs, and online and other specialty retailers as well as service providers that install home improvement products. Location of stores continues to be a key competitive factor in our industry; however, the increasing use of technology and the simplicity of online shopping also underscore the importance of omni-channel capabilities as a 4Table of Contentscompetitive factor. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by providing better customer experiences while delivering superior value in products and service. See further discussion of competition in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, of this Annual Report. Products and ServicesOur ProductsProduct SelectionTo meet customers’ varying needs, we offer a complete line of products for construction, maintenance, repair, remodeling, and decorating. We offer home improvement products in the following categories: Lumber & Building Materials, Appliances, Seasonal & Outdoor Living, Tools & Hardware, Fashion Fixtures, Rough Plumbing & Electrical, Paint, Millwork, Lawn & Garden, Flooring, and Kitchens. A typical Lowe’s-branded home improvement store stocks approximately 34,000 items, with hundreds of thousands of additional items available through our Special Order Sales system and various online selling channels. See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, of this Annual Report for historical revenues by product category for each of the last three fiscal years. We are committed to offering a wide selection of national brand-name merchandise complemented by our selection of private brands. In addition, we are dedicated to ensuring the products we sell are sourced in a socially responsible, efficient, and cost effective manner.National Brand-Name MerchandiseIn many product categories, customers look for a familiar and trusted national brand to instill confidence in their purchase. Lowe’s home improvement stores carry a wide selection of national brand-name merchandise such as Whirlpool®, GE®, LG®, and Samsung® appliances, Stainmaster® carpets, Sherwin-Williams® and Valspar® paints and stains, Pella® windows and doors, Pergo® hardwood flooring, Dewalt® power tools, Hitachi® pneumatic tools, Weber® and Char-Broil® grills, Owens Corning® insulation and roofing, GAF® roofing, James Hardie® fiber cement siding, Marshalltown® masonry tools and concrete, Husqvarna® outdoor power equipment, John Deere® riding lawn mowers, Werner® ladders, Quoizel® lighting, Nest® products, SharkBite® plumbing products, A. O. Smith® water heaters, Norton® abrasives, and many more. In 2018, we welcomed CRAFTSMAN® to our portfolio of brands offering a variety of tools, storage and outdoor power equipment. We also expanded our partnership with Sherwin Williams® becoming the only national home center to offer Krylon® spray paint, Minwax® stains and finishes, Cabot® stains, Thompson’s Water Seal® stains and waterproofing, and Purdy® paint brushes. In addition, we added brand name merchandise such as Estwing® hammers, Zoeller® pumps, MAPEI® tile-setting materials, and SMARTCORE® vinyl plank products to our portfolio. Our merchandise selection provides the retail and Pro customer a one-stop shop for a wide variety of national brand-name merchandise needed to complete home improvement, repair, maintenance, or construction projects.Private BrandsPrivate brands are an important element of our overall portfolio, helping to provide significant value and coordinated style across core categories. We sell private brands in several of our product categories. Some of Lowe’s most important private brands include Kobalt® tools, allen+roth® home décor products, Blue Hawk® home improvement products, Project Source® basic value products, Portfolio® lighting products, Garden Treasures® lawn and patio products, Utilitech® electrical and utility products, Reliabilt® doors and windows, Aquasource® faucets, sinks and toilets, Harbor Breeze® ceiling fans, and Top Choice® lumber products.Supply ChainWe source our products from vendors worldwide and believe that alternative and competitive suppliers are available for virtually all of our products. Whenever possible, we purchase directly from manufacturers to provide savings for customers and improve our gross margin.To efficiently move product from our vendors to our stores and maintain in-stock levels, we own and operate distribution facilities that enable products to be received from vendors, stored and picked, or cross-docked, and then shipped to our retail locations or directly to customers. These facilities include 15 highly-automated regional distribution centers (RDC) and 15 flatbed distribution centers (FDC) in the United States. The FDCs distribute merchandise that requires special handling due to size or type of packaging such as lumber, boards, panel products, pipe, siding, ladders, and building materials. On average, each RDC and FDC serves approximately 115 stores. We also own and operate seven distribution centers, including four lumber yards, to serve our Canadian market. 5Table of ContentsIn addition to the RDCs and FDCs, we also operate coastal holding facilities, transload facilities, appliance distribution centers, and a direct fulfillment center focused on parcel post eligible products. Collectively, our facilities enable our import and e-commerce, as well as parcel post eligible products, to get to their destination as efficiently as possible. Most parcel post items can be ordered by a customer and delivered within two business days at standard shipping rates.In fiscal 2018, on average, approximately 80% of the total dollar amount of stock merchandise we purchased was shipped through our distribution network, while the remaining portion was shipped directly to our stores from vendors.Our ServicesInstalled SalesWe offer installation services through independent contractors in many of our product categories, with Appliances, Flooring, Kitchens, Lumber & Building Materials, and Millwork accounting for the majority of installed sales. Our Installed Sales model, which separates selling and project administration tasks, allows our sales associates to focus on project selling, while project managers ensure that the details related to installing the products are efficiently executed. Installed Sales, which includes both product and labor, accounted for approximately 7% of total sales in fiscal 2018.Extended Protection Plans and Repair ServicesWe offer extended protection plans for various products within the Appliances, Kitchens, Fashion Fixtures, Millwork, Rough Plumbing & Electrical, Seasonal & Outdoor Living, and Tools & Hardware categories. These protection plans provide customers with product protection that enhances or extends coverage offered by the manufacturer’s warranty, and provides additional customer friendly benefits that go beyond the scope of a manufacturer’s warranty. The protection plans provide in-warranty and out-of-warranty repair services for major appliances, outdoor power equipment, tools, grills, fireplaces, air conditioners, water heaters, and other eligible products through our stores or in the home through the Lowe’s Authorized Service Repair Network. We offer replacement plans for products in most of these categories when priced below $300, or otherwise specified category-specific price points. Our contact center takes customers’ calls, assesses the problems, and facilitates resolutions, making after-sales service easier for our customers by managing the entire process.Selling ChannelsWe are continuing to enhance our omni-channel capabilities, which allows our customers to move from channel to channel with simple and seamless transitions even within the same transaction. For example, for many projects, more than half of our customers conduct research online before making an in-store purchase. For purchases made on Lowes.com, customers may pick up their purchase in-store, have their purchase delivered from a store, or have their purchase parcel shipped. In addition, flexible fulfillment options are available for in-store purchases and those made through the contact center. Regardless of the channels through which customers choose to engage with us, we strive to provide them with a seamless experience across channels and an endless aisle of products, enabled by our flexible fulfillment capabilities. Our ability to sell products in-store, online, on-site, or through our contact centers speaks to our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure with the omni-channel capabilities we continue to introduce.In-StoreOur 1,790 Lowe’s-branded home improvement stores, inclusive of 1,723 in the U.S. and 67 in Canada, are generally open seven days per week and average approximately 112,000 square feet of retail selling space, plus approximately 32,000 square feet of outdoor garden center selling space. The 212 RONA stores operate under various complementary store formats that address target customers and occasions. Our home improvement stores in the U.S. and Canada offer similar products and services, with certain variations based on local market factors. We continue to develop and implement tools to make our sales associates more efficient and to integrate our order management and fulfillment processes. Our home improvement stores have Wi-Fi capabilities that provide customers with internet access, making information available quickly to further simplify the shopping experience. OnlineThrough our websites and mobile applications, we seek to empower consumers by providing a 24/7 shopping experience, online product information, customer ratings and reviews, online buying guides and how-to videos and other information. These tools help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions and give them increased confidence to undertake home improvement projects. We enable customers to choose from a variety of fulfillment options, including buying online and picking up in-store as well as delivery or parcel shipment to their homes.In addition, our LowesForPros.com online tool allows for easy online ordering for our Pro customers, and their choice of in-store pick-up or delivery, saving them time and money.6Table of ContentsOn-SiteWe have on-site specialists available for retail and Pro customers to assist them in selecting products and services for their projects. Our Account Executives ProServices meet with Pro customers at their place of business or on a job site and leverage stores within the area to ensure we meet customer needs for products and resources. In addition, our Project Specialist Exteriors (PSE) program is available in all U.S. Lowe’s home improvement stores to discuss exterior projects such as roofing, siding, fencing, and windows, whose characteristics lend themselves to an in-home consultative sales approach. Contact CentersLowe’s operates three contact centers which are located in Wilkesboro, NC, Albuquerque, NM, and Indianapolis, IN. These contact centers help Lowe’s enable an omni-channel customer experience by providing the ability to tender sales, coordinate deliveries, manage after-sale installations, facilitate repair services for Appliances and Outdoor Power Equipment, and answer general customer questions via phone, mail, e-mail, live chat, and social media.Employees As of February 1, 2019, we employed approximately 190,000 full-time and 110,000 part-time employees. Certain employees in Canada are subject to collective bargaining agreements. No other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Management considers its relations with employees to be good.Seasonality and Working CapitalThe retail business in general is subject to seasonal influences, and our business is, to some extent, seasonal. Historically, we have realized the highest volume of sales during our second fiscal quarter (May, June and July) and the lowest volume of sales during our fourth fiscal quarter (November, December and January). Accordingly, our working capital requirements have historically been greater during our fourth fiscal quarter as we build inventory in anticipation of the spring selling season and as we experience lower fourth fiscal quarter sales volumes. We fund our working capital requirements primarily through cash flows generated from operations, but also with short-term borrowings, as needed. For more detailed information, see the Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, of this Annual Report.Intellectual PropertyThe name “Lowe’s” is a registered service mark of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We consider this mark and the accompanying name recognition to be valuable to our business. This subsidiary and other wholly owned subsidiaries own and maintain various additional registered and unregistered trademarks, trade names and service marks, including but not limited to retail names “RONA” and “Reno Depot”, and private brand product names “Kobalt” and “allen+roth”. These subsidiaries also maintain various Internet domain names that are important to our business, and we also own registered and unregistered copyrights. In addition, we maintain patent portfolios related to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect certain innovations that we incorporate into our products, services, or business operations.SustainabilityLowe’s is committed to leveraging our time, talents and resources to make our world better by making our communities stronger and making people want to connect with us as their partner in home improvement. In fiscal 2018, the Board of Directors created a Sustainability Committee that oversees sustainability and environmental matters and monitors related trends and risks. The Company also has a Sustainability Council, led by senior executives. Our strategy focuses on responsible sourcing, offering safe and eco-friendly products, maintaining diverse, healthy, engaged, and skilled workforce, supporting our local communities, and operating ethically and responsibly. We also established new goals to advance our corporate responsibility efforts and intend to work towards achieving the following goals by 2025:•Lowe’s and the Lowe’s Foundation intends to invest $350 million in local communities through partnerships and charitable contributions.•Lowe’s will encourage employees to contribute more than three million volunteer hours to improve the communities where they live, work, and play.•Lowe’s intends to ensure all strategic suppliers have sustainability goals.7Table of Contents•Lowe’s intends to increase the number of eco-friendly products available to customers, with the goal of helping our customers save more than $40 billion in energy costs through the sale of ENERGY STAR® products.•Lowe’s intends to have all wood products responsibly sourced.We want our customers to feel good about the high-quality products they choose at Lowe’s. Our products undergo a rigorous selection process, beginning with our sourcing decisions. We give considerable attention to how our products are created and about the people who make them. Through collaboration and established management systems, we monitor our suppliers’ practices to ensure we are securing high quality products from suppliers who support worker rights and protect the environment. We are also including innovative, efficient and eco-certified products into our portfolio that provide health and environmental benefits to meet the needs of an increasing customer demand. We are continuing to work with local and regional utilities to offer customers assorted rebates for a variety of environmentally efficient products including ENERGY STAR® and WaterSense®.As a responsible corporate citizen, Lowe’s takes environmental sustainability and product safety very seriously. In fiscal 2018, we published an updated wood sourcing policy to ensure that all wood products sold in our stores originate from well-managed, non-endangered forests and committed to achieve 100 percent Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification for all wood products sourced from identified regions at risk by 2020. To manage chemicals more responsibly, Lowe’s implemented a safer chemicals policy through a number of strategic actions and commitments. In addition, Lowe’s stopped the sale of all products containing methylene chloride and N-Methyl-2-Pyrrolidone (NMP) online and from our stores.We are committed to reducing our climate impact through sustainable practices and conservation. In fiscal 2018, 399 retail locations upgraded to interior light-emitting diode (LED) lighting. We also replaced 104 aging HVAC units with high-efficiency units and added Variable Fan Drive systems in over 419 stores. We also signed our first renewable energy agreement comprised of 100 megawatts of renewable wind energy in 2018. We are dedicated to promoting sustainable practices in the transportation industry, and we collaborate with the Environmental Protection Agency’s SmartWay program to reduce transportation emissions by managing and reducing fuel usage by creating incentives for freight contractors to improve efficiency and are proud to be the only retailer to achieve the Environmental Protection Agency SmartWay Excellence Award ten years in a row.Lowe’s participates in the Carbon Disclosure Project’s climate, forestry, and water questionnaires to benchmark and quantify our environmental efforts. In fiscal 2018, Lowe’s also externally verified its greenhouse gas emissions data collection and analysis to validate our findings and increase confidence in our reporting. At a local level, store waste, including cardboard, broken appliances, wood pallets, and more, are recycled through national and regional partners, and we provide in-store recycling centers for our customers to bring in compact fluorescent lamp bulbs, plastic bags, and rechargeable batteries. In addition, managing our water resources is essential, particularly in regions experiencing drought conditions. Our HydroPoint systems, which combine real-time weather data with site-specific information to reduce water consumption and save on utility costs, are now deployed to approximately 925 locations, covering all stores with operable irrigation systems. For more information about Lowe’s sustainability efforts, please visit Newsroom.Lowes.com/Responsibility.Investing in Our CommunitiesLowe’s has a long and proud history of supporting local communities through volunteerism as well as public education and community improvement projects, beginning with the creation of the Lowe’s Foundation in 1957. In 2018, all U.S. Lowe’s stores completed at least one Lowe’s Heroes volunteer project, contributing approximately 200,000 hours to improve spaces in their local communities. Lowe’s and the Lowe’s Foundation donated approximately $46 million to schools and community organizations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, including disaster relief and rebuilding efforts.Lowe’s continues to work with national nonprofit partners to strengthen and stabilize neighborhoods across the country. In 2018, Lowe’s contributed $7 million and teamed with Habitat for Humanity and Rebuilding Together to provide housing solutions for families across the country. Lowe’s also supported nonprofits including the Hispanic Scholarship Fund, Thurgood Marshall Scholarship, United Negro College Fund, the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, SkillsUSA, The Nature Conservancy and Keep America Beautiful to improve communities and build tomorrow’s leaders. Lowe’s is also committed to helping communities in the days leading up to and months following a natural disaster. In 2018, Lowe’s contributed more than $4 million to disaster relief and mobilized hundreds of volunteers to help communities recovering from storms like Hurricanes Florence and Michael. After Hurricane Florence made landfall, Lowe’s doubled the 8Table of ContentsCompany’s match for the Employee Relief Fund, which provides financial support to associates affected by natural disasters and other hardships. That match continued throughout the year. Together, Lowe’s and its generous associates raised over $4.0 million in 2018, helping approximately 3,100 associates in need. Today, Lowe’s strategic philanthropic giving focuses on the critical needs affecting its associates, communities and industry by supporting safe, affordable housing initiatives as well as skilled trade education.For more information on Lowe’s partnerships and latest community improvement projects, visit Newsroom.Lowes.com/Responsibility.Available Information Our Annual Report, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are made available free of charge through our internet website at www.Lowes.com/investor, as soon as reasonably practicable after such documents are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
