Total gross margin decreased by 0.6 percentage points. Various items such as higher amortization of purchased intangible assets and the TiVo patent litigation settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 contributed to the product gross margin percentage decline. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively declined by 1.4 percentage points, primarily due to lower sales and marketing expenses and lower general and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were lower due primarily to the absence in the current fiscal year of impairment charges on real estate held for sale. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 1.1 percentage points, primarily as a result of an increase in revenue, lower restructuring charges, and our continuing focus on expense management. Diluted earnings per share increased by 25% from the prior year, a result of both a 24% increase in net income and also, to a lesser degree, from a slight decline of 24 million shares in our diluted share count. A significant driver of the increase in net income in fiscal 2013 was our realization of additional tax benefits of $1.0 billion, primarily related to a tax settlement with the IRS and the reinstatement of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit.Fiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012—Business SummaryOur solid fiscal 2013 performance reflects our continued execution on our financial strategy to deliver profitable growth to maximize shareholder value for the long term. In what continues to be a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment, we grew profits faster than revenue, with revenue increasing by 6%, while net income increased by 24%. In fiscal 2013, revenue increased by $2.5 billion. The Americas contributed $2.1 billion of the increase, led by higher sales in the United States. APJC contributed $0.3 billion to the revenue increase, led by strong sales growth in India. EMEA added $0.1 billion to the revenue increase in fiscal 2013. Both our product and service categories experienced revenue growth across each of our geographic segments. We encountered certain challenges from a geographic perspective, including those related to macroeconomic challenges in much of Europe. We also faced some macroeconomic challenges in APJC, particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, which most notably involved China and Japan. Partially offsetting these challenges was solid revenue growth in fiscal 2013 in certain emerging countries such as Mexico within the Americas, India within APJC, and Russia within EMEA. From a customer markets standpoint, in fiscal 2013 we had solid revenue growth in the commercial market, as well as growth in the service provider market, due in large part to the acquisition of NDS. The enterprise and public sector customer markets experienced slight declines in revenue in fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012. Global public sector spending was a challenge for us in fiscal 2013, particularly in the Americas, attributable in part to lower U.S. public sector spending during parts of fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012.In fiscal 2013, product revenue increased by $1.7 billion, while service revenue increased by $0.8 billion. The product revenue increase was driven by the following: an increase of $1.0 billion from Service Provider Video products, driven primarily by the acquisition of NDS at the beginning of fiscal 2013; an increase of $0.8 billion from Data Center products, due to continued strong customer demand; and an increase of $0.5 billion from Wireless products, due to continued demand for these solutions. These product revenue increases, along with the service revenue contribution, reflect, in our view, the success we are experiencing with our technology architectures and our ability to deliver customer solutions, particularly in both the enterprise and service provider data center and cloud environments. Overall, our product revenue from our core product areas was flat as an increase in revenue from our Switching products was offset by a decrease in revenue from our NGN Routing products.We achieved solid and profitable growth in fiscal 2013, and did so in a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment. This included, in particular, weakness in the European economy, lower global public sector spending, and a conservative approach to IT-related capital spending by customers. Notwithstanding improvements we saw in some of these areas during the latter part of fiscal 2013, our business in fiscal 2014 may continue to be impacted by these challenges, as well as other macroeconomic challenges including weakness in certain emerging countries, such as China. In order to invest more significantly in our growth opportunity areas of our portfolio including cloud, Data Center, mobility, services, software and security, we will rebalance our resources in fiscal 2014. As a result, we have announced a workforce reduction plan that will impact approximately 4,000 employees or 5% of our global workforce. We expect that these actions will position Cisco to invest in these growth opportunities as our business continues to evolve and to drive operational efficiencies.38Table of ContentsFourth Quarter SnapshotFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2012, revenue increased by 6%, with both product and service revenue increasing by 6%. With regard to our geographic segment performance, on a year-over-year basis, revenue increased by 7% in the Americas, increased by 12% in EMEA, and decreased by 3% in APJC. Total gross margin decreased by 1.4 percentage points, primarily as a result of the TiVo patent litigation settlement. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively declined by 2.9 percentage points, primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, general and administrative expenses included $202 million of real estate charges, primarily related to impairment charges on real estate held for sale. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 2.4 percentage points, primarily as a result of lower general and administrative expenses, lower restructuring and other charges, and also the impact of our revenue increase. Diluted earnings per share increased by 17% from the prior year period, primarily as a result of an 18% increase in net income.Strategy and Focus AreasOur focus continues to be on our five foundational priorities:•Leadership in our core business (routing, switching, and associated services) which includes comprehensive security and mobility solutions •Collaboration •Data center virtualization and cloud •Video•Architectures for business transformationWe believe that focusing on these priorities best positions us to continue to expand our share of our customers’ information technology spending. For a full discussion of our strategy and focus areas, see Item 1. Business.Other Key Financial MeasuresThe following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 (in millions, except days sales outstanding in accounts receivable (DSO) and annualized inventory turns): Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2012Cash and cash equivalents and investments $50,610 $48,716Cash provided by operating activities $12,894 $11,491Deferred revenue $13,423 $12,880Repurchases of common stock—stock repurchase program $2,773 $4,360Dividends $3,310 $1,501DSO 40 days 34 daysInventories $1,476 $1,663Annualized inventory turns 13.8 11.7Our product backlog at the end of fiscal 2013 was $4.9 billion, or 10% of fiscal 2013 total revenue, compared with $5.0 billion at the end of fiscal 2012, or 11% of fiscal 2012 total revenue.39Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met:•Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Contracts, Internet commerce agreements, and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.•Delivery has occurred. Shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery.•The fee is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.•Collectibility is reasonably assured. We assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer’s payment history.In instances where final acceptance of the product, system, or solution is specified by the customer, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. When a sale involves multiple deliverables, such as sales of products that include services, the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting, and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price. Revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met.The amount of product and service revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and, if so, our valuation of the units of accounting for multiple deliverables. According to the accounting guidance prescribed in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605, Revenue Recognition, we use vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE) for each of those units, when available. We determine VSOE based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the historical standalone transactions have the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range, generally evidenced by approximately 80% of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus 15% of the median rates. When VSOE does not exist, we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multiple-deliverable arrangements. Under the selling price hierarchy, third-party evidence of selling price (TPE) will be considered if VSOE does not exist, and estimated selling price (ESP) will be used if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Generally, we are not able to determine TPE because our go-to-market strategy differs from that of others in our markets, and the extent of our proprietary technology varies among comparable products or services from those of our peers. In determining ESP, we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors, based on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement. We typically arrive at an ESP for a product or service that is not sold separately by considering company-specific factors such as geographies, competitive landscape, internal costs, profitability objectives, pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing, and existing portfolio pricing and discounting. Some of our sales arrangements have multiple deliverables containing software and related software support components. Such sales arrangements are subject to the accounting guidance in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition.As our business and offerings evolve over time, our pricing practices may be required to be modified accordingly, which could result in changes in selling prices, including both VSOE and ESP, in subsequent periods. There were no material impacts during fiscal 2013, nor do we currently expect a material impact in the next 12 months on our revenue recognition due to any changes in our VSOE, TPE, or ESP. Revenue deferrals relate to the timing of revenue recognition for specific transactions based on financing arrangements, service, support, and other factors. Financing arrangements may include sales-type, direct-financing, and operating leases, loans, and guarantees of third-party financing. Our deferred revenue for products was $4.0 billion and $3.7 billion as of July 27, 2013 and July 28, 2012, respectively. Technical support services revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed, which typically is from one to three years. Advanced services revenue is recognized upon delivery or completion of performance. Our deferred revenue for services was $9.4 billion and $9.2 billion as of July 27, 2013 and July 28, 2012, respectively.40Table of ContentsWe make sales to distributors which we refer to as two-tier systems of sales to the end customer. Revenue from distributors is recognized based on a sell-through method using information provided by them. Our distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs. If actual credits received by our distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.Allowances for Receivables and Sales ReturnsThe allowances for receivables were as follows (in millions, except percentages): July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012Allowance for doubtful accounts $228 $207Percentage of gross accounts receivable 4.0% 4.5%Allowance for credit loss—lease receivables $238 $247Percentage of gross lease receivables 6.3% 7.2%Allowance for credit loss—loan receivables $86 $122Percentage of gross loan receivables 5.2% 6.8%The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience, credit quality and age of the receivable balances, as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay and expected default frequency rates, which are published by major third-party credit-rating agencies and are generally updated on a quarterly basis. We also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts. If a major customer's creditworthiness deteriorates, if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, or if other circumstances arise, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, and additional allowances could be required, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.The allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis. When evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis, we consider historical experience, credit quality and age of receivable balances, and economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. When evaluating financing receivables on a collective basis, we use expected default frequency rates published by a major third-party credit-rating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default, while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions, concentration of risk and correlation. Determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings, as well as assessing factors such as economic conditions, concentration of risk, and correlation, are complex and subjective. Our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results. Both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible.A reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. The reserve for future sales returns as of July 27, 2013 and July 28, 2012 was $119 million and $129 million, respectively, and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable. If the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established, our revenue could be adversely affected. Inventory Valuation and Liability for Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and SuppliersOur inventory balance was $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion as of July 27, 2013 and July 28, 2012, respectively. Inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories, determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of our cost of sales. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. As of July 27, 2013, the liability for these purchase commitments was $172 million, compared with $193 million as of July 28, 2012, and was included in other current liabilities.41Table of ContentsOur provision for inventory was $114 million, $115 million, and $196 million for fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. The provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was $106 million, $151 million, and $114 million in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. The decrease in our provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the increase in demand for our products resulting in lower inventory levels with our contract manufacturers during fiscal 2013. If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we could be required to increase our inventory write-downs, and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and accordingly our profitability, could be adversely affected. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments. Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence, particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainties and conditions and the resulting potential for changes in future demand forecast. Warranty CostsThe liability for product warranties, included in other current liabilities, was $431 million as of July 27, 2013, compared with $415 million as of July 28, 2012. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years, and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty. We accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs, technical support labor costs, and associated overhead. Material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment. Technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period. Overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities.The provision for product warranties issued during fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011 was $664 million, $661 million, and $456 million, respectively. If we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected, our profitability could be adversely affected.Share-Based Compensation ExpenseShare-based compensation expense is presented as follows (in millions):Years EndedJuly 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011Share-based compensation expense$1,120 $1,401 $1,620Restricted stock units are valued using the market value of our common stock on the date of grant, discounted for the present value of expected dividends. Restricted stock unit awards with market-based conditions are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The determination of the fair value of employee stock options and employee stock purchase rights on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. For employee stock options and employee stock purchase rights, these variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends as of the grant date. For employee stock options, we historically have used the implied volatility for two-year traded options on our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the lattice-binomial model. For employee stock purchase rights, we used the implied volatility for traded options (with lives corresponding to the expected life of the employee stock purchase rights) on our stock. The selection of the implied volatility approach was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. The valuation of employee stock options (granted in prior fiscal years, but for which expense was recognized during the fiscal years presented) is also impacted by kurtosis and skewness, which are technical measures of the distribution of stock price returns and the actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. Because share-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for forfeitures. If factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of our option-pricing model in future periods or if we experience different forfeiture rates, the compensation expense that is derived may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current year.42Table of ContentsFair Value MeasurementsOur fixed income and publicly traded equity securities, collectively, are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at a fair value of $42.7 billion as of July 27, 2013, compared with $38.9 billion as of July 28, 2012. Our fixed income investment portfolio, as of July 27, 2013, consisted primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.As described more fully in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a valuation hierarchy is based on the level of independent, objective evidence available regarding the value of the investments. It encompasses three classes of investments: Level 1 consists of securities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical securities; Level 2 consists of securities for which observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs are used, such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets and model-derived valuations for which the variables are derived from, or corroborated by, observable market data; and Level 3 consists of securities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value.Our Level 2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. We use inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from independent pricing vendors, quoted market prices, or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities. We use such pricing data as the primary input, to which we have not made any material adjustments during fiscal 2013 and 2012, to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio. We are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates.The inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness, may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information, and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to its estimate of fair value. The assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective. However, given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio, and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets, we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of subjectivity and judgment was material to the valuation of the investment portfolio as of July 27, 2013. We had no Level 3 investments in our total portfolio as of July 27, 2013.Other-than-Temporary Impairments We recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary. The ultimate value realized on these securities, to the extent unhedged, is subject to market price volatility until they are sold.If the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary. An impairment is considered other than temporary if (i) we have the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on (i) or (ii) described in the prior sentence, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (iii), the amount representing credit loss, defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security, will be recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). In estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected, we consider all available information, including past events, current conditions, the remaining payment terms of the security, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults, and the value of underlying collateral.For publicly traded equity securities, we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.Impairment charges on our investments in publicly traded equity securities were not material in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011. There were no impairment charges on investments in fixed income securities in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income.We also have investments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages. As of July 27, 2013, our investments in privately held companies were $833 million, compared with $858 million as of July 28, 2012, and were included in other assets. We monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment and will make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required, based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. Our impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were $33 million, $23 million, and $10 million in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.43Table of ContentsGoodwill and Purchased Intangible Asset ImpairmentsOur methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.The goodwill recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 27, 2013 and July 28, 2012 was $21.9 billion and $17.0 billion, respectively. The increase in goodwill for fiscal 2013 was due in large part to our acquisitions of NDS and Meraki. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill resulting from our annual impairment testing in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011. For the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2013, the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was $38.7 billion for the Americas, $15.5 billion for EMEA, and $17.8 billion for APJC. We performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit as of July 27, 2013 would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. There was no impairment charge related to purchased intangible assets during fiscal 2013. Our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were $12 million and $164 million during fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R&D tax credits, domestic manufacturing deductions, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, international realignments, and transfer pricing adjustments. Our effective tax rate was 11.1%, 20.8%, and 17.1% in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.44Table of ContentsOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by expiration of or lapses in the R&D tax credit or domestic manufacturing deduction laws; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany R&D cost-sharing arrangement and legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, including possible U.S. changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.Loss ContingenciesWe are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.45Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSRevenueThe following table presents the breakdown of revenue between product and service (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentRevenue: Product $38,029 $36,326 $1,703 4.7% $36,326 $34,526 $1,800 5.2%Percentage of revenue 78.2% 78.9% 78.9% 79.9% Service 10,578 9,735 843 8.7% 9,735 8,692 1,043 12.0%Percentage of revenue 21.8% 21.1% 21.1% 20.1% Total $48,607 $46,061 $2,546 5.5% $46,061 $43,218 $2,843 6.6%We manage our business primarily on a geographic basis, organized into three geographic segments. Our revenue, which includes product and service, for each segment is summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentRevenue: Americas $28,639 $26,501 $2,138 8.1% $26,501 $25,015 $1,486 5.9%Percentage of revenue 58.9% 57.5% 57.5% 57.9% EMEA 12,210 12,075 135 1.1% 12,075 11,604 471 4.1%Percentage of revenue 25.1% 26.2% 26.2% 26.8% APJC 7,758 7,485 273 3.6% 7,485 6,599 886 13.4%Percentage of revenue 16.0% 16.3% 16.3% 15.3% Total $48,607 $46,061 $2,546 5.5% $46,061 $43,218 $2,843 6.6%Fiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012 For fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, total revenue increased by 6%. Within total revenue growth, product revenue increased by 5%, while service revenue increased by 9%. Our product and service revenue totals reflect revenue growth across each of our geographic segments. The revenue increase was primarily due to the following: the solid performance of our Service offerings, our acquisition of NDS at the beginning of fiscal 2013, and increased demand for our Data Center and Wireless products.We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations.In addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced IT spending environment and budget-driven reductions in spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple-element arrangements; the mix of financing arrangements provided to our channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment. As has been the case in certain of our emerging countries from time to time, customers require greater levels of financing arrangements, service, and support, and these activities may occur in future periods, which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue.46Table of ContentsFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, total revenue increased by 7%. Within total revenue growth, product revenue increased by 5%, while service revenue increased by 12%. Our product and service revenue totals reflected revenue growth across each of our geographic segments. The revenue increase was primarily due to the following: the strong performance of our Service offerings; new product transitions taking place in Switching; and increased demand for our Data Center, Service Provider Video, and Wireless products.Product Revenue by SegmentThe following table presents the breakdown of product revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentProduct revenue: Americas $21,653 $20,168 $1,485 7.4% $20,168 $19,292 $876 4.5%Percentage of product revenue 57.0% 55.5% 55.5% 55.9% EMEA 10,049 10,024 25 0.2% 10,024 9,788 236 2.4%Percentage of product revenue 26.4% 27.6% 27.6% 28.3% APJC 6,327 6,134 193 3.1% 6,134 5,446 688 12.6%Percentage of product revenue 16.6% 16.9% 16.9% 15.8% Total $38,029 $36,326 $1,703 4.7% $36,326 $34,526 $1,800 5.2%AmericasFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012For fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, product revenue in the Americas segment increased by 7%. The increase in product revenue was across most of our customer markets in the Americas segment, led by solid growth in the service provider and commercial markets and, to a lesser degree, growth in the enterprise market. The growth in product revenue in the service provider market was due in large part to our acquisition of NDS at the beginning of fiscal 2013. Within the Americas segment, we experienced a product revenue decline in the public sector market, driven by lower sales to the public sector in the United States. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 9% in the United States, 13% in Brazil, and 7% in Mexico. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we experienced some weakness in our business momentum in certain countries within Latin America. Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, product revenue in the Americas segment increased by 5%. The increase in product revenue was across most of our customer markets in the Americas segment, led by growth in the enterprise, service provider and commercial markets. We experienced a product revenue decline in the public sector market for the fiscal year. Within the Americas segment, product revenue to the U.S. public sector was flat, as lower product revenue to the U.S. federal government was offset by higher product revenue to state and local government. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 4% in the United States, 10% in Canada, 21% in Mexico, and 14% in Brazil. EMEAFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012In fiscal 2013, we experienced a continuation of many of the macroeconomic challenges we faced in EMEA in fiscal 2012. While we did see some improvements in most of the European economy as the fiscal year progressed, we continued to see weakness in southern Europe throughout fiscal 2013. For fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, product revenue in the EMEA segment was flat, as growth in the commercial, service provider and public sector markets was offset by a decline in the enterprise market. The growth in product revenue in the service provider market was due to our acquisition of NDS at the beginning of fiscal 2013. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 1% in the United Kingdom, 11% in Russia, 4% in Switzerland, and 3% in Spain. These increases were offset by product revenue declines of 3% in each of Germany and France and 13% in the Netherlands. Product revenue for Italy was flat year over year. 47Table of ContentsFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, product revenue in the EMEA segment increased by 2%. The increase was across most of our customer markets in the EMEA segment, led by growth in the commercial, enterprise and public sector markets. We experienced a slight decline in product revenue in the service provider customer market during the fiscal year driven by lower revenue from this customer market in several of the large countries in the region. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 11% in the United Kingdom, 15% in Russia, and 9% in the Netherlands. These increases were partially offset by product revenue declines of 23% in Italy, 21% in Spain, 2% in Germany, and 1% in France.We believe that the slower growth we experienced in EMEA was a result of weak macroeconomic conditions attributable in large part to the austerity measures taking place in parts of the region. In particular, we experienced weakness in this segment during the second half of fiscal 2012, with a year-over-year decline in product revenue in this segment during the fourth quarter.APJCFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012For fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, product revenue in the APJC segment increased by 3%. We experienced solid product revenue growth in the commercial and service provider markets and, to a lesser degree, in the public sector market. The growth in product revenue in the service provider market was due primarily to our acquisition of NDS at the beginning of fiscal 2013. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 3% in Australia, 34% in India, and 10% in South Korea. These increases were partially offset by product revenue declines of 5% in China and 7% in Japan, reflecting certain challenges that we faced in these countries during portions of fiscal 2013, most notably in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, product revenue in the APJC segment increased by 13%. The increase was led by strong product revenue growth in the service provider market, and to a lesser degree, in the commercial, enterprise and public sector markets. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 27% in Japan, 17% in China, and 12% in Australia. We experienced a year-over-year product revenue decline of 19% in South Korea, and 4% in India. Our revenue decline in India was due to ongoing business momentum challenges in the public sector customer market.48Table of ContentsProduct Revenue by Groups of Similar ProductsIn addition to the primary view on a geographic basis, we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes. Our product categories consist of the following categories (with subcategories in parentheses): Switching (fixed switching, modular switching, and storage); NGN Routing (high-end routers, mid-range and low-end routers, and other NGN Routing products); Service Provider Video (connected devices, video software and solutions, cable access and NDS); Collaboration (unified communications and Cisco TelePresence); Wireless; Data Center; Security; and Other Products. The Other Products category consists primarily of emerging technology products and other networking products.

Sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches increased by 4%, or $366 million, while sales of modular switches decreased by 1%, or approximately $76 million. The increase in sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches was primarily due to higher sales of Cisco Nexus Series Switches, partially offset by sales declines in certain of our Cisco Catalyst product families. Sales of modular switches decreased due to lower sales of Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches, partially offset by higher sales in Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches. Product revenue in the Switching category was also negatively impacted by a 24% decrease in sales of storage products. 49Table of ContentsFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, product revenue in our Switching category increased by 3%, or $412 million. The increase was primarily due to growth from transitioning products taking place in our Switching product portfolio. The impact of competitive pressures moderated growth, primarily in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2012. Within our Switching product category, higher sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches and storage products were partially offset by lower sales of modular switches. Sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches increased by 11%, or $819 million, while sales of modular switches decreased by 8%, or approximately $468 million. The increase in sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches was primarily due to increased sales of Cisco Catalyst 2960 Series Switches, Cisco Nexus 2000 and 5000 Series Switches, and the Cisco Catalyst 3750 Series Switches, partially offset by decreased sales of Cisco Catalyst 3560 Series Switches. Product revenue in our Switching category was positively impacted by a 12% increase in sales of storage products, primarily stemming from strong growth in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2012. Sales of modular switches decreased primarily due to lower sales of Cisco Catalyst 6500 and 4500 Series Switches, partially offset by increased sales of Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches. NGN RoutingFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012Sales in our NGN Routing product category decreased by 2%, or $152 million, driven by a 3%, or $142 million, decrease in sales of high-end router products and an 8%, or $58 million, decrease in sales of other NGN Routing products. These decreases were partially offset by a 2%, or $47 million, increase in sales of our midrange and low-end router products. Within the high-end router product category, we experienced lower sales of our Cisco CRS-1 and CRS-3 Carrier Routing System products and our legacy high-end router products, partially offset by continued adoption of our Cisco Aggregation Services Routers (ASR) products. Higher sales in our midrange and low-end router products were driven by the continued adoption of our Cisco Integrated Services Routers (ISR) platform. The decline in sales of other NGN Routing products was due to decreased sales of certain other routing and optical networking products. Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, product revenue in our NGN Routing product category increased by 2%, or $196 million. The increase in sales of our NGN Routing product category was driven by a 7%, or $332 million, increase in sales of high-end router products, partially offset by a 3%, or $87 million, decline in sales of our midrange and low-end router products. Within the high-end router products category, the increase was driven by higher sales of Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System products and higher sales of the Cisco ASR 9000, 5000, and 1000 family of products. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of Cisco 7600 and 12000 Series Routers. Within the midrange and low-end router products category, the decrease was related to the product transition taking place within our Cisco ISR products, as the sales decline in our older generation products had a greater impact than the growth experienced with our Cisco ISR 1900, ISR 2900, and ISR 3900 router products in this category. Sales of other NGN Routing products decreased by 6%, compared with fiscal 2011, primarily due to decreased sales of other routing and optical networking products. Service Provider VideoFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012Our Service Provider Video products category grew by 26%, or $991 million, due primarily to the acquisition of NDS at the beginning of fiscal 2013. Higher revenue from our connected devices and higher revenue from our video software and solutions also contributed to the increase. The increase in sales of connected devices products was primarily due to increased sales of cable set-top boxes. Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, sales of Service Provider Video products increased by 10%, or $346 million, due to growth in our service provider customer market from increased sales of set-top boxes worldwide. Sales in connected devices increased by 19%, or $408 million, sales in video software and solutions increased by 18%, or $39 million, while sales in cable access decreased by 9%, or $100 million. CollaborationFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012Our Collaboration product category continues to shift its focus to recurring revenue streams driven by SaaS offerings. Overall, sales of Collaboration products decreased by 6%, or $237 million, primarily due to a decline in sales of Cisco TelePresence Systems and, to a lesser degree, a decline in sales of Unified Communications products. Lower public sector spending in the United States, as well as demand weakness in Europe, were significant drivers of the decline in sales of Cisco TelePresence Systems. We also experienced a decline in sales of Unified Communications products, which was due primarily to lower sales of Unified 50Table of ContentsCommunications infrastructure products as a result of our sales emphasis on shifting towards products with recurring revenue streams.Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, sales of Collaboration products increased by 3%, or $121 million. The increase was due to a 5% increase in sales of unified communications products, primarily IP phones and collaborative web-based offerings, partially offset by a 1% decrease in sales of Cisco TelePresence systems. Challenges in both the public sector and demand weakness in Europe, along with our execution challenges related to our sales coverage model, contributed to the decrease in sales of Cisco TelePresence systems in fiscal 2012.WirelessFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012Sales of Wireless products increased by 31%, or $507 million. This increase reflects the continued customer adoption of and migration to the unified access architecture of the Cisco Unified Wireless Network, and also reflects increased sales of new products in this category as well as sales of products related to our acquisition of Meraki. Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, sales of Wireless products increased by 19%, or $259 million. These increases reflect the continued customer adoption of our wireless architecture and new product performance. Data CenterFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012We experienced strong growth in our Data Center product category, which grew by 60%, or $775 million, with strong sales growth of our Cisco Unified Computing System products across all geographic segments and customer markets. The increase was due in large part to the continued momentum we are experiencing with our products for both data center and cloud environments, as current customers increase their data center build-outs and as new customers deploy these offerings. To the extent our data center business grows and further penetrates the market, we expect that, in comparison to what we experienced during the initial rapid growth of this business, the growth rates for our data center product sales will experience more normal seasonality consistent with the overall server market. Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, sales of Data Center products increased by 86%, or $602 million, due to increased sales of Cisco Unified Computing System products. The increase was due to the momentum we are experiencing with our products for the enterprise and service provider data center and cloud environments, as current customers increase their data center build out, and new customer product purchases. SecurityFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012Sales of Security products were flat as higher sales in high-end firewall products within our network security product portfolio were offset by lower sales of our content security products.Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, sales of Security products increased by 13%, or $150 million. These increases were primarily due to growth in our network security products driven by the recent update of our firewall security product portfolio.Other ProductsFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012We experienced a 34%, or $339 million, decrease in sales of Other Products due in large part to lower sales of our Linksys products, which product line we sold during the third quarter of fiscal 2013.Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011The decrease in sales of Other Products for fiscal 2012 was primarily due to lower sales of Flip Video camera products in connection with our decision in fiscal 2011 to exit this consumer product line.51Table of ContentsService Revenue by SegmentThe following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages):Years EndedJuly 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentService revenue: Americas$6,986 $6,333 $653 10.3% $6,333 $5,723 $610 10.7%Percentage of service revenue66.1% 65.0% 65.0% 65.8% EMEA2,161 2,051 110 5.4% 2,051 1,816 235 12.9%Percentage of service revenue20.4% 21.1% 21.1% 20.9% APJC1,431 1,351 80 5.9% 1,351 1,153 198 17.2%Percentage of service revenue13.5% 13.9% 13.9% 13.3% Total$10,578 $9,735 $843 8.7% $9,735 $8,692 $1,043 12.0%Fiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012Service revenue experienced solid growth across all of our geographic segments. Worldwide technical support services revenue increased by 6%, and worldwide advanced services, which relate to consulting support services for specific network needs, experienced 16% revenue growth. Technical support service experienced growth across all of our geographic segments, led by growth in our Americas segment. Renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with product sales provided an installed base of equipment being serviced which, in concert with new service offerings, were the primary factors driving these increases. We experienced revenue growth in advanced services across all geographic segments, led by growth in the Americas segment. Advanced services revenue growth was driven by solid growth in both transaction and subscription revenues. Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, service revenue experienced double-digit percentage growth across all of our geographic segments. Worldwide technical support services revenue increased by 10%, and worldwide advanced services experienced 20% revenue growth. Technical support services revenue grew across all of our geographic segments, with strong revenue growth in our EMEA and APJC segments. Renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with recent product sales have resulted in a new installed base of equipment being serviced, which was the primary driver for these increases. Advanced services revenue also grew across all geographic segments, with particularly strong growth in APJC. The APJC revenue growth in advanced services was led by strength in the second half of fiscal 2012 and was driven by both subscription growth and transaction growth, which was in part the result of the completion of several large, multiyear projects in this region. 52Table of ContentsGross MarginThe following table presents the gross margin for products and services (in millions, except percentages): AMOUNT PERCENTAGEYears EndedJuly 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011Gross margin: Product$22,488 $21,821 $20,879 59.1% 60.1% 60.5%Service6,952 6,388 5,657 65.7% 65.6% 65.1%Total$29,440 $28,209 $26,536 60.6% 61.2% 61.4%Product Gross MarginFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012The following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013: ProductGross MarginPercentageFiscal 2012 60.1 %Sales discounts, rebates, and product pricing (2.9)%Mix of products sold (0.7)%Productivity (1) 3.7 %TiVo patent litigation settlement (0.5)%Amortization of purchased intangible assets (0.5)%Acquisition fair value adjustment to inventory and other (0.1)%Fiscal 2013 59.1 % (1) Productivity includes overall manufacturing-related costs, shipment volume, and other items not categorized elsewhere.Product gross margin decreased by 1.0 percentage points compared with fiscal 2012.

These factors impacted most of our customer markets and all of our geographic segments. Additionally, our product gross margin for fiscal 2013 was negatively impacted by the shift in the mix of products sold, primarily as a result of revenue increases for our relatively lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products. These impacts were offset by continued productivity improvements. The productivity improvements were in large part due to increased benefits from cost savings, particularly in certain of our Switching and NGN Routing categories in which product transitions have been taking place, and were driven by value engineering efforts, favorable component pricing, and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations. Value engineering is the process by which production costs are reduced through component redesign, board configuration, test processes, and transformation processes.Because the preceding factors largely offset each other, the decline in our product gross margin percentage was largely driven by our acquisition of NDS, which resulted in higher amortization expense from purchased intangible assets along with costs resulting from a fair value adjustment to inventory acquired as part of that acquisition. In addition, during fiscal 2013 we incurred charges related to the TiVo patent litigation settlement in the fourth quarter that were included as part of cost of sales. The combined effect of these items was a negative impact to our product gross margin of 1.1 percentage points for fiscal 2013. Our future gross margins could be impacted by our product mix and could be adversely affected by further growth in sales of products that have lower gross margins, such as Cisco Unified Computing System products. Our gross margins may also be impacted by the geographic mix of our revenue and, as was the case in fiscal 2013 and 2012, may be adversely affected by increased sales discounts, rebates, and product pricing attributable to competitive factors. Additionally, our manufacturing-related costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain, which in turn could negatively affect gross margin. If any of the preceding factors that in the past have negatively impacted our gross margins arise in future periods, our gross margins could continue to decline.53Table of ContentsFiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011The following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012: Product Gross Margin Percentage (1)Fiscal 2011 60.5 %Sales discounts, rebates, and product pricing (2.4)%Mix of products sold (0.9)%Productivity 2.1 %Amortization of purchased intangible assets 0.3 %Restructuring and other charges 0.5 %Fiscal 2012 60.1 %(1) Beginning in fiscal 2013, we refined our methodology for presenting the items in the preceding table, and accordingly certain reclassifications have been made to fiscal 2012 amounts to conform to the presentation made for the fiscal 2013 amounts.In fiscal 2012, product gross margin decreased by 0.4 percentage points compared with fiscal 2011. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of higher sales discounts, rebates, and unfavorable product pricing, which were driven by normal market factors and by the geographic mix of product revenue. These factors impacted most of our customer markets and all of our geographic segments. Additionally, our product gross margin for fiscal 2012 was negatively impacted by the shift in the mix of products sold, primarily as a result of revenue increases in our relatively lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products and increased revenue in other lower margin products. In fiscal 2012, we experienced a positive mix impact from the absence of the lower margin consumer related products due to our exit from the Flip Video camera product line in fiscal 2011. The negative impacts to product gross margin were partially offset by lower restructuring charges, the absence of significant impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets, lower amortization expense in fiscal 2012 and productivity improvements. The productivity improvements were in part due to increased benefits from our value engineering efforts, particularly in certain of our Switching products; favorable component pricing; and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations. Service Gross MarginFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012Our service gross margin percentage increased slightly by 0.1 percentage points for fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012. Although we experienced higher sales volume from growth in both advanced services and in technical support services, the resulting benefit to gross margin was offset by increased cost impacts such as headcount-related costs, partner delivery costs, and unfavorable mix. The mix impacts were due to our lower gross margin advanced services business contributing a higher proportion of service revenue for fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012. Our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. Other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services.Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011Our service gross margin percentage increased by 0.5 percentage points for fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume for both technical support services and advanced services. The benefit to gross margin of increased volume was partially offset by increased headcount-related and partner delivery costs, and unfavorable mix. The mix impacts were due to our lower gross margin advanced services revenue contributing a higher proportion of service revenue for fiscal 2012, as compared with the prior year. Lower share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 also added to the increase in service gross margin. For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, gross margin from technical support services was flat as the benefits from a 10% increase in revenue combined with lower supply chain costs were offset by higher headcount-related costs. For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, gross margin in advanced services increased primarily due to a 20% increase in revenue in fiscal 2012. Partially offsetting the volume benefit were higher delivery team costs which were, in part headcount related, and higher partner delivery costs. Our revenue from advanced services may increase to a higher proportion of total service revenue due to our continued focus on providing comprehensive support to our customers’ networking devices, applications, and infrastructures. 54Table of ContentsGross Margin by SegmentThe following table presents the total gross margin for each segment (in millions, except percentages): AMOUNT PERCENTAGESYears Ended July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011Gross margin: Americas $17,887 $16,639 $15,766 62.5% 62.8% 63.0%EMEA 7,876 7,605 7,452 64.5% 63.0% 64.2%APJC 4,637 4,519 4,143 59.8% 60.4% 62.8%Segment total 30,400 28,763 27,361 62.5% 62.4% 63.3%Unallocated corporate items (1) (960) (554) (825) Total $29,440 $28,209 $26,536 60.6% 61.2% 61.4% (1) The unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, impacts to cost of sales from purchase accounting adjustments to inventory, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, significant litigation settlements (which consisted of $172 million recorded to cost of sales for the TiVo patent litigation settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013), and certain other charges. We do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments. Fiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012We experienced a gross margin percentage decrease in our Americas and APJC segments, while our EMEA segment experienced a gross margin percentage increase. The Americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage decline due to the impact of higher sales discounts, rebates and unfavorable pricing, and also due to unfavorable mix impacts, partially offset by productivity improvements. The gross margin percentage increase in our EMEA segment was primarily the result of productivity improvements from lower overall manufacturing costs and, to a lesser degree, favorable mix impacts and higher service gross margin. Partially offsetting these favorable impacts to gross margin were negative impacts from higher sales discounts, rebates and unfavorable pricing. The APJC segment gross margin percentage declined due primarily to the impact of higher sales discounts, rebates and unfavorable pricing, lower service gross margin, and unfavorable mix impacts. Partially offsetting these factors were productivity improvements, driven in large part by lower overall manufacturing costs and higher volume.The gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment. Our product and service gross margins may be impacted by economic downturns or uncertain economic conditions as well as our movement into new market opportunities, and could decline if any of the factors that impact our gross margins are adversely affected in future periods. Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011For fiscal 2012, we experienced a gross margin percentage decline across all of our geographic segments as compared with fiscal 2011. The Americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage decline with the impact of higher sales discounts, rebates and unfavorable pricing being substantially offset by higher volume, higher service gross margin, lower overall manufacturing and delivery costs, and favorable mix impacts. Significantly lower revenue from the consumer market resulted in a positive gross margin mix impact to the Americas segment for fiscal 2012.The gross margin percentage decline in our EMEA segment was primarily the result of unfavorable mix impacts; higher sales discounts, rebates and unfavorable pricing; and lower service gross margin due to increased headcount-related costs. These decreases were partially offset by lower overall manufacturing and delivery costs and increased volume in this segment.The APJC segment experienced the largest gross margin percentage decline of all of our geographic segments due primarily to the impact of higher sales discounts, rebates and unfavorable pricing, lower service gross margin, and unfavorable mix impacts. These decreases were partially offset by increased volume and lower overall manufacturing and delivery costs. 55Table of ContentsFactors That May Impact Revenue and Gross MarginProduct revenue may continue to be affected by factors, including global economic downturns and related market uncertainty, that have resulted in cautious IT-related capital spending in our enterprise, service provider, public sector, and commercial markets; changes in the geopolitical environment and global economic conditions; competition, including price-focused competitors from Asia, especially from China; new product introductions; sales cycles and product implementation cycles; changes in the mix of our customers between service provider and enterprise markets; changes in the mix of direct sales and indirect sales; variations in sales channels; and final acceptance criteria of the product, system, or solution as specified by the customer. Sales to the service provider market have been and may be in the future characterized by large and sporadic purchases, especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain products within our Collaboration and Data Center product categories. In addition, service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader range of services, including network design services; and often have acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition. Certain of our customers in certain emerging countries also tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may similarly be affected by the timing of revenue recognition. As we focus on new market opportunities, customers may require greater levels of financing arrangements, service, and support, especially in certain emerging countries, which in turn may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition. To improve customer satisfaction, we continue to focus on managing our manufacturing lead-time performance, which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog. A decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quarter-to-quarter revenue and operating results.Product revenue may also be adversely affected by fluctuations in demand for our products, especially with respect to telecommunications service providers and Internet businesses, whether or not driven by any slowdown in capital expenditures in the service provider market; price and product competition in the communications and information technology industry; introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products; adoption of new networking standards; and financial difficulties experienced by our customers. We may, from time to time, experience manufacturing issues that create a delay in our suppliers’ ability to provide specific components, resulting in delayed shipments. To the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in periods when we and our suppliers are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters are not remediated within the same quarter. For additional factors that may impact product revenue, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Our distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs. Increased sales to our distributors generally result in greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and, to a certain degree, the timing of orders from our customers. We recognize revenue for sales to our distributors generally based on a sell-through method using information provided by them, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for all cooperative marketing and other programs.Product gross margin may be adversely affected in the future by changes in the mix of products sold, including periods of increased growth of some of our lower margin products; introduction of new products, including products with price-performance advantages, and new business models for our offerings such as XaaS; our ability to reduce production costs; entry into new markets, including markets with different pricing structures and cost structures, as a result of internal development or through acquisitions; changes in distribution channels; price competition, including competitors from Asia, especially those from China; changes in geographic mix of our product revenue; the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals; sales discounts; increases in material or labor costs, including share-based compensation expense; excess inventory and obsolescence charges; warranty costs; changes in shipment volume; loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing; effects of value engineering; inventory holding charges; and the extent to which we successfully execute on our strategy and operating plans. Additionally, our manufacturing-related costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain. Service gross margin may be impacted by various factors such as the change in mix between technical support services and advanced services; the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals; share-based compensation expense; and the timing of our strategic investments in headcount and resources to support this business.56Table of ContentsResearch and Development (“R&D”), Sales and Marketing, and General and Administrative (“G&A”) ExpensesR&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses are summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentResearch and development $5,942 $5,488 $454 8.3 % $5,488 $5,823 $(335) (5.8)%Percentage of revenue 12.2% 11.9% 11.9% 13.5% Sales and marketing 9,538 9,647 (109) (1.1)% 9,647 9,812 (165) (1.7)%Percentage of revenue 19.6% 20.9% 20.9% 22.7% General and administrative 2,264 2,322 (58) (2.5)% 2,322 1,908 414 21.7 %Percentage of revenue 4.7% 5.0% 5.0% 4.4% Total $17,744 $17,457 $287 1.6 % $17,457 $17,543 $(86) (0.5)%Percentage of revenue 36.5% 37.9% 37.9% 40.6% R&D ExpensesFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012The increase in R&D expenses for fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, was primarily due to higher headcount-related expenses attributable in large part to our acquisitions. Partially offsetting these costs was lower share-based compensation expense. For further explanation of the year-over-year decrease in share-based compensation expense, see “Share-Based Compensation Expense” below. We continue to invest in R&D in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. If we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal R&D.Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011The decrease in R&D expenses for fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, was primarily due to lower headcount-related expenses resulting from our restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and lower share-based compensation expense. Additionally, R&D expenses declined due to lower acquisition-related expenses, which were driven by the absence in fiscal 2012 of certain compensation payments that were paid in the prior year. Sales and Marketing ExpensesFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012For fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, sales and marketing expenses decreased by $109 million, primarily due to lower share-based compensation expense and, to a lesser degree, lower discretionary spending and contracted services. These items were partially offset by higher headcount-related expense resulting largely from our acquisitions.Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, sales and marketing expenses decreased by $165 million. Marketing expenses decreased by $204 million, which were partially offset by an increase of $39 million in sales expenses. The decrease in marketing expenses for the period was due to lower advertisement expenses, lower headcount-related expenses, and lower share-based compensation expense. The increase in sales expenses was due primarily to higher project-related services, partially offset by lower headcount-related expenses and lower share-based compensation expense. The decline in headcount-related expenses for both sales and marketing was in part attributable to our restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.G&A ExpensesFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012G&A expenses decreased in fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, primarily due to the absence in the current year of $202 million of impairment charges on real estate held for sale recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Lower share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2013 and a recovery in the market value of property held for sale recorded during fiscal 2013 also contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by higher headcount-related expenses resulting in part from our acquisitions and also by higher corporate-level expenses. Corporate-level expenses, which tend to vary from period to period, 57Table of Contentsincluded operational infrastructure activities such as IT project implementations, which included investments in our global data center infrastructure, and investments related to operational and financial systems.Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011G&A expenses increased in fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, primarily due to a net increase of approximately $300 million in real estate charges, primarily for impairments on real estate held for sale, followed by other increased corporate-level expenses. The increase in real estate charges in fiscal 2012 was primarily due to charges of $202 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. These increased corporate-level expenses, which tend to vary from period to period, include increases related to our operational infrastructure such as real estate; IT project implementations, which include further investments in our global data center infrastructure, and investments related to operational and financial systems.Partially offsetting these increases were lower share-based compensation expense, and lower headcount-related expenses due to the restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Effect of Foreign CurrencyIn fiscal 2013, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by $227 million, or approximately 1.3%, compared with fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2012, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, increased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by $90 million, or approximately 0.5%, compared with fiscal 2011. HeadcountFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012Our headcount increased by 8,410 employees in fiscal 2013. The increase was attributable to the headcount from acquisitions, the largest of which was NDS, as well as targeted hiring in engineering and services.In August 2013, we announced that we are rebalancing our resources with a workforce reduction plan that will impact approximately 4,000 employees or 5% of our global workforce. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011Our headcount decreased by 5,186 employees in fiscal 2012. The decrease was attributable to headcount reductions from the completion of the sale of our Juarez, Mexico manufacturing operations and from our restructuring actions initiated in July 2011. Partially offsetting these declines in headcount were headcount increases due to the growth of our service business and targeted hiring in engineering, which includes the hiring of recent university graduates. Share-Based Compensation ExpenseThe following table presents share-based compensation expense (in millions):Years Ended July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011Cost of sales—product $40 $53 $61Cost of sales—service 138 156 177Share-based compensation expense in cost of sales 178 209 238Research and development 286 401 481Sales and marketing 484 588 651General and administrative 175 203 250Restructuring and other charges (3) — —Share-based compensation expense in operating expenses 942 1,192 1,382Total share-based compensation expense $1,120 $1,401 $1,620The year-over-year decrease in share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, was due primarily to a decrease in the aggregate value of share-based awards granted in recent periods, higher forfeiture credits in fiscal 2013, and the effect of stock options awards from prior years becoming fully amortized and replaced with restricted stock units with a lower aggregate value. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The decrease in share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, was due primarily to a decrease in the aggregate value of share-based awards granted in recent periods, the timing of the annual grants to employees in fiscal 2012, and stock options awards from prior years becoming fully amortized and replaced with restricted stock units with a lower aggregate value. 58Table of ContentsAmortization of Purchased Intangible AssetsThe following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses (in millions): Years Ended July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011Amortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses $395 $383 $520The increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets for fiscal 2013, compared with fiscal 2012, was primarily due to amortization of purchased intangible assets from our acquisition of NDS at the beginning of fiscal 2013 and from our other fiscal 2013 acquisitions, partially offset by certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized during fiscal 2013. The decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets for fiscal 2012, compared with fiscal 2011, was primarily due to the absence of significant impairment charges during fiscal 2012 and also due to certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized or impaired in fiscal 2011. The impairment charges in fiscal 2011 were primarily due to declines in estimated fair value as a result of reductions in expected future cash flows associated with certain products from our then consumer product lines. For additional information regarding purchased intangible assets, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. We consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets. Restructuring and Other ChargesFiscal 2011 PlansIn connection with the Fiscal 2011 Plans (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), we incurred within operating expenses net restructuring and other charges of approximately $105 million, $304 million, and $799 million for fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. August Fiscal 2014 PlanIn August 2013, we announced a workforce reduction plan. We are rebalancing our resources with a workforce reduction plan that will impact approximately 4,000 employees or 5% of our global workforce. We expect to take action under this plan beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. We currently estimate that we will recognize pretax charges to our financial results in an amount not expected to exceed $550 million consisting of severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other associated costs. Operating IncomeThe following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011Operating income $11,196 $10,065 $7,674Operating income as a percentage of revenue 23.0% 21.9% 17.8%In fiscal 2013 our results reflect solid execution on delivering profitable growth, as we grew operating income faster than revenue. In fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, operating income increased by 11%, and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 1.1 percentage points. The increases resulted from the following: revenue growth of 6%; continuing focus on expense management, which resulted in lower sales and marketing and G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue; and lower restructuring and other charges. In fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, operating income increased by 31%, as a percentage of revenue, operating income increased by 4.1 percentage points. The increase resulted from: revenue growth of 7%; effective expense management that resulted in lower total R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue; lower amortization of purchased intangible assets; lower restructuring and other charges; and lower share-based compensation expense. 59Table of ContentsInterest and Other Income, NetInterest Income (Expense), Net The following table summarizes interest income and interest expense (in millions):Years EndedJuly 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 Variancein Dollars July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Variancein DollarsInterest income$654 $650 $4 $650 $641 $9Interest expense(583) (596) 13 (596) (628) 32Interest income (expense), net$71 $54 $17 $54 $13 $41Interest income increased slightly in both fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 as compared with the respective prior fiscal years. The slight increases were primarily due to increased interest income earned on financing receivables, partially offset by lower interest income from our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and fixed income investments as a result of lower average interest rates. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012 was attributable to the favorable impact of interest rate swaps and lower expense on our floating-rate notes as the benchmark London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) decreased. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was attributable to the effect of lower average interest rates on our debt.Other Income (Loss), Net The components of other income, net, are summarized as follows (in millions):Years EndedJuly 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 Variancein Dollars July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Variancein DollarsGains (losses) on investments, net: Publicly traded equity securities$17 $43 $(26) $43 $88 $(45)Fixed income securities31 58 (27) 58 91 (33)Total available-for-sale investments48 101 (53) 101 179 (78)Privately held companies(57) (70) 13 (70) 34 (104)Net gains (losses) on investments(9) 31 (40) 31 213 (182)Other gains (losses), net(31) 9 (40) 9 (75) 84Other income (loss), net$(40) $40 $(80) $40 $138 $(98)Fiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012The decrease in net gains on available-for-sale investments in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 was attributable to lower gains on fixed income and publicly traded equity securities in fiscal 2013 as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the unrealized gains and losses on investments. For fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012, the change in net losses on investments in privately held companies was primarily due to higher realized gains from various private investments, partially offset by an increase of $23 million in our proportional share of losses from our VCE joint venture. The change in other gains (losses), net for fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012, was primarily due to an increase in donations and less favorable foreign exchange impacts in fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011The decrease in total net gains on available-for-sale investments in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was attributable to lower gains on fixed income and publicly traded equity securities in fiscal 2012 as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities. For fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011, the change in net (losses) gains on investments in privately held companies was primarily due to equity method losses related to our proportional share of losses from our VCE joint venture increasing by $84 million for fiscal 2012. The change in other gains (losses), net for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011, was primarily due to more favorable foreign exchange impacts in fiscal 2012.60Table of ContentsProvision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates, higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates, and expiration of or lapses in tax incentives. Our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries. If these earnings were distributed to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes.Fiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 11.1% for fiscal 2013, compared with 20.8% for fiscal 2012. The net 9.7 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was primarily attributable to a net tax benefit of $794 million, or 7.1 percentage points, due to a tax settlement with the IRS and an increase in tax benefits of $144 million, or 1.2 percentage points, due to the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit in fiscal 2013.For a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 20.8% for fiscal 2012, compared with 17.1% for fiscal 2011. The net 3.7 percentage point increase in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was primarily attributable to a smaller proportion of net income which was subject to foreign income tax rates that are lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and the expiration of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit on December 31, 2011, partially offset by other items including a reduction in state taxes.61Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowsCash and Cash Equivalents and Investments The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments (in millions): July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 Increase (Decrease)Cash and cash equivalents$7,925 $9,799 $(1,874)Fixed income securities39,888 37,297 2,591Publicly traded equity securities2,797 1,620 1,177Total$50,610 $48,716 $1,894The increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments was primarily the result of cash provided by operating activities of $12.9 billion, an increase from $11.5 billion provided for fiscal 2012, and issuance of common stock of $3.3 billion pursuant to employee stock incentive plans. These sources of cash were partially offset by cash paid for acquisitions of $6.8 billion, cash dividends paid of $3.3 billion, the repurchase of common stock of $2.8 billion under the stock repurchase program, and capital expenditures of $1.2 billion. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012 was primarily the result of an increase in net income.Our total in cash and cash equivalents and investments held by various foreign subsidiaries was $40.4 billion and $42.5 billion as of July 27, 2013 and July 28, 2012, respectively. Under current tax laws and regulations, if cash and cash equivalents and investments held outside the United States were to be distributed to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. The balance available in the United States as of July 27, 2013 and July 28, 2012 was $10.2 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Sourcefire, which will reduce our current balance of cash and cash equivalents and investments available in the United States by approximately $2.7 billion upon completion of the acquisition. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our fixed income investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below.Free Cash Flow and Capital Allocation In August 2012, as part of our capital allocation strategy, we announced our intent to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock, which objective we accomplished in fiscal 2013.We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment. The following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions):Years EndedJuly 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011Net cash provided by operating activities$12,894 $11,491 $10,079Acquisition of property and equipment(1,160) (1,126) (1,174)Free cash flow$11,734 $10,365 $8,905We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue, excess tax benefits resulting from share-based compensation, and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. For additional discussion, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report.62Table of ContentsWe consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net income provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do. The following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases (in millions, except per-share amounts): DIVIDENDS STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM TOTALYears Ended Per Share Amount Shares Weighted-Average Price per Share Amount AmountJuly 27, 2013 $0.62 $3,310 128 $21.63 $2,773 $6,083July 28, 2012 $0.28 $1,501 262 $16.64 $4,360 $5,861July 30, 2011 $0.12 $658 351 $19.36 $6,791 $7,449On September 3, 2013, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per common share to be paid on October 23, 2013 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 3, 2013.Accounts Receivable, Net The following table summarizes our accounts receivable, net (in millions), and DSO: July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 Increase (Decrease)Accounts receivable, net$5,470 $4,369 $1,101DSO40 34 6Our accounts receivable net, as of July 27, 2013 increased by approximately 25% compared with the end of fiscal 2012. Our DSO as of July 27, 2013 was higher by 6 days compared with the end of fiscal 2012, primarily due to the timing of product shipments, as a higher proportion of shipments were made in the latter part of the fourth quarter in fiscal 2013.Inventory Supply Chain The following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in millions, except annualized inventory turns): July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 Increase (Decrease)Inventories$1,476 $1,663 $(187)Annualized inventory turns13.8 11.7 2.1Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers$4,033 $3,869 $164Inventory as of July 27, 2013 decreased by 11% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2012, and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by approximately 4%. On a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers were flat compared with the end of fiscal 2012. The inventory decrease was primarily due to lower levels of manufactured finished goods, which in turn was due in part to inventory sold as part of the sale of our Linksys product line. The increase in purchase commitments in fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, was driven primarily by new product introductions and an increase in customer demand. We believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts.Our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods. Distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers. Manufactured finished goods consist primarily of build-to-order and build-to-stock products.We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, 63Table of Contentsand adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity.Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels.Financing Receivables and Guarantees We measure our net balance sheet exposure position related to our financing receivables and financing guarantees by reducing the total of gross financing receivables and financing guarantees by the associated allowances for credit loss and deferred revenue. As of July 27, 2013, our net balance sheet exposure position related to financing receivables and financing guarantees was as follows (in millions): FINANCING RECEIVABLES FINANCINGGUARANTEES TOTALJuly 27, 2013LeaseReceivables LoanReceivables Financed ServiceContracts and Other Total Channel Partner End-User Customers Total Gross amount less unearned income$3,507 $1,649 $3,136 $8,292 $438 $237 $675 $8,967Allowance for credit loss(238) (86) (20) (344) — — — (344)Deferred revenue(41) (32) (2,036) (2,109) (225) (191) (416) (2,525)Net balance sheet exposure$3,228 $1,531 $1,080 $5,839 $213 $46 $259 $6,098Financing Receivables Gross financing receivables less unearned income increased by 9% compared with the end of fiscal 2012. The change was primarily due to a 10% increase in lease receivables and an 18% increase in financed service contracts and other, partially reduced by an 8% decline in loan receivables. We provide financing to certain end-user customers and channel partners to enable sales of our products, services, and networking solutions. These financing arrangements include leases, financed service contracts, and loans. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases. We also provide certain qualified customers financing for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services and advanced services. Our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term.Financing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. Deferred Revenue Related to Financing Receivables and Guarantees The majority of the deferred revenue in the preceding table is related to financed service contracts. The majority of the revenue related to financed service contracts, which primarily relates to technical support services, is deferred as the revenue related to financed service contracts is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed. A portion of the revenue related to lease and loan receivables is also deferred and included in deferred product revenue based on revenue recognition criteria not currently having been met.64Table of ContentsBorrowingsSenior Notes The following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes (in millions): July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012Senior notes: Floating-rate notes, due 2014$1,250 $1,2501.625% fixed-rate notes, due 20142,000 2,0002.90% fixed-rate notes, due 2014500 5005.50% fixed-rate notes, due 20163,000 3,0003.15% fixed-rate notes, due 2017750 7504.95% fixed-rate notes, due 20192,000 2,0004.45% fixed-rate notes, due 20202,500 2,5005.90% fixed-rate notes, due 20392,000 2,0005.50% fixed-rate notes, due 20402,000 2,000Total$16,000 $16,000Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable quarterly on the floating-rate notes. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of July 27, 2013.Other Debt Other debt includes secured borrowings associated with customer financing arrangements, notes and credit facilities with a number of financial institutions that are available to certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and notes related to our investment in Insieme Networks, Inc. (“Insieme”). The amount of borrowings outstanding under these arrangements was $31 million and $41 million as of July 27, 2013 and July 28, 2012, respectively.Commercial Paper In fiscal 2011, we established a short-term debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper notes. As of July 27, 2013 and July 28, 2012 we had no commercial paper outstanding under this program.Credit Facility On February 17, 2012, we terminated our then-existing credit facility and entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on February 17, 2017. Any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the higher of the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, Bank of America’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time, or one-month LIBOR plus 1.00% or (ii) LIBOR plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement. As of July 27, 2013, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility.We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and/or extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to February 17, 2019. Deferred Revenue The following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue (in millions): July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 Increase (Decrease)Service$9,403 $9,173 $230Product4,020 3,707 313 Total$13,423 $12,880 $543Reported as: Current$9,262 $8,852 $410Noncurrent4,161 4,028 133 Total$13,423 $12,880 $543The increase in deferred service revenue in fiscal 2013 reflects the impact of new contract initiations and renewals, partially reduced by the ongoing amortization of deferred service revenue. The increase in deferred product revenue was primarily due to increased deferrals related to subscription revenue arrangements.65Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. In addition, we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at July 27, 2013 (in millions): PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIODJuly 27, 2013Total Less than1 Year 1 to 3Years 3 to 5Years More than5 YearsOperating leases$1,149 $367 $439 $160 $183Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers4,033 4,033 — — —Other purchase obligations1,085 516 491 77 1Long-term debt16,021 3,260 3,510 751 8,500Other long-term liabilities635 — 101 433 101Total by period$22,923 $8,176 $4,541 $1,421 $8,785Other long-term liabilities (uncertainty in the timing of future payments)2,147 Total$25,070 Operating Leases For more information on our operating leases, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. A significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in “Inventory Supply Chain.” As of July 27, 2013, the liability for these purchase commitments was $172 million and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table.Other Purchase Obligations Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations.Long-Term Debt The amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, noncurrent deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $1,748 million and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of $399 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).Other CommitmentsIn connection with our business combinations and asset purchases, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or continued employment with us of certain employees of acquired entities. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $263 million as of July 27, 2013, compared with $120 million as of July 28, 2012.Insieme Networks, Inc. In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we made an investment in Insieme, an early stage company focused on research and development in the data center market. As set forth in the agreement between Cisco and Insieme, this investment includes $100 million of funding and a license to certain of our technology. In addition, pursuant to a November 2012 amendment to the agreement between Cisco and Insieme, we agreed to invest an additional $35 million in Insieme upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. As of July 27, 2013, we owned approximately 84% of Insieme as a result of these investments and have consolidated the results of Insieme in our Consolidated Financial Statements.66Table of ContentsIn connection with this investment, we have entered into a put/call option agreement that provides us with the right to purchase the remaining interests in Insieme. In addition, the noncontrolling interest holders can require us to purchase their shares upon the occurrence of certain events. If we acquire the remaining interests of Insieme, the noncontrolling interest holders are eligible to receive two milestone payments, which will be determined using agreed-upon formulas based on revenue for certain of Insieme’s products. We will begin recognizing the amounts due under the milestone payments when it is determined that such payments are probable of being earned, which may occur in the first half of fiscal 2014. When such a determination is made, the milestone payments will then be recorded as compensation expense by us based on an estimate of the fair value of the amounts probable of being earned, pursuant to a vesting schedule. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the amounts probable of being earned and the continued vesting will result in adjustments to the recorded compensation expense. The maximum amount that could be recorded as compensation expense by us is approximately $863 million. This amount was increased from a previous maximum of $750 million as a result of the November 2012 amendment, as the parties recognized that higher staffing levels may be necessary to perform additional product development. The milestone payments, if earned, are expected to be paid primarily during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements. In the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers. These privately held companies and customers may be considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings, and we have determined that as of July 27, 2013 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities.VCE is a joint venture that we formed in fiscal 2010 with EMC Corporation (“EMC”), with investments from VMware, Inc. (“VMware”) and Intel Corporation. VCE helps organizations leverage best-in-class technologies and disciplines from Cisco, EMC, and VMware to enable the transformation to cloud computing. As of July 27, 2013, our cumulative gross investment in VCE was approximately $507 million, inclusive of accrued interest, and our ownership percentage was approximately 35%. During fiscal 2013, we invested approximately $93 million in VCE. We account for our investment in VCE under the equity method, and our portion of VCE’s net loss is recognized in other income (loss), net. As of July 27, 2013, we have recorded cumulative losses since inceptions from VCE of $422 million. Our carrying value in VCE as of July 27, 2013 was $85 million. Over the next 12 months, as VCE scales its operations, we expect that we will make additional investments in VCE and may incur additional losses proportionate with our share ownership.From time to time, EMC and Cisco may enter into guarantee agreements on behalf of VCE to indemnify third parties, such as customers, for monetary damages. Such guarantees were not material as of July 27, 2013.On an ongoing basis, we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing Receivables and Guarantees.”Securities LendingWe periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale investments. These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. The average daily balance of securities lending for fiscal 2013 and 2012 was $0.7 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. As of July 27, 2013 and July 28, 2012, we had no outstanding securities lending transactions. We believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements. Liquidity and Capital Resource RequirementsBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, pending acquisitions, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for capital resources. 67Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskOur financial position is exposed to a variety of risks, including interest rate risk, equity price risk, and foreign currency exchange risk. Interest Rate RiskFixed Income Securities We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk. At any time, a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates, including the impact from lower credit spreads, could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives. We had no outstanding hedging instruments for our fixed income securities as of July 27, 2013. Our fixed income investments are held for purposes other than trading. Our fixed income investments are not leveraged as of July 27, 2013. We monitor our interest rate and credit risks, including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers. As of July 27, 2013, 77% of our fixed income securities balance consisted of U.S. government and U.S. government agency securities. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong.The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our fixed income securities, including the hedging effects when applicable, as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates. The market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (“BPS”), plus 100 BPS, and plus 150 BPS. Due to the low interest rate environment at the end of each of fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, we did not believe a parallel shift of minus 100 BPS or minus 150 BPS was relevant. The hypothetical fair values as of July 27, 2013 and July 28, 2012 are as follows (in millions): VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTS FAIR VALUEAS OFJULY 27,2013 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPSFixed income securitiesN/A N/A $40,193 $39,888 $39,583 $39,278 $38,973 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTS FAIR VALUEAS OFJULY 28,2012 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPSFixed income securitiesN/A N/A $37,483 $37,297 $37,111 $36,924 $36,737Financing Receivables As of July 27, 2013, our financing receivables had a carrying value of $7.9 billion, compared to $7.2 billion as of July 28, 2012. As of July 27, 2013, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.1 billion, respectively. Debt As of July 27, 2013, we had $16.0 billion in principal amount of senior notes outstanding, which consisted of $1.25 billion floating-rate notes and $14.75 billion fixed-rate notes. The carrying amount of the senior notes was $16.2 billion, and the related fair value was $17.6 billion, which fair value is based on market prices. As of July 27, 2013, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed-rate debt, excluding the $5.25 billion of hedged debt, by a decrease or increase of $0.4 billion, respectively. However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed-rate debt, which is not hedged.68Table of ContentsEquity Price RiskThe fair value of our equity investments in publicly traded companies is subject to market price volatility. We may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio. Our equity portfolio consists of securities with characteristics that most closely match the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index or NASDAQ Composite Index. These equity securities are held for purposes other than trading. To manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain equity securities, we may enter into equity derivatives designated as hedging instruments.Publicly Traded Equity Securities The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of publicly traded equity securities as a result of selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each equity security in the portfolio, excluding hedged equity securities, if any. Potential fluctuations in the price of each equity security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 20%, and 30% were selected based on potential near-term changes in those security prices. The hypothetical fair values as of July 27, 2013 and July 28, 2012 are as follows (in millions): VALUATION OFSECURITIESGIVEN AN X%DECREASE INEACH STOCK’S PRICE FAIR VALUEAS OFJULY 27,2013 VALUATION OFSECURITIESGIVEN AN X%INCREASE INEACH STOCK’S PRICE (30)% (20)% (10)% 10% 20% 30%Publicly traded equity securities$1,000 $1,143 $1,286 $1,429 $1,572 $1,715 $1,858 VALUATION OFSECURITIESGIVEN AN X%DECREASE INEACH STOCK’S PRICE FAIR VALUEAS OFJULY 28,2012 VALUATION OFSECURITIESGIVEN AN X%INCREASE INEACH STOCK’S PRICE (30)% (20)% (10)% 10% 20% 30%Publicly traded equity securities$944 $1,078 $1,213 $1,348 $1,483 $1,618 $1,752Investments in Privately Held Companies We have also invested in privately held companies. These investments are recorded in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are accounted for using primarily either the cost or the equity method. As of July 27, 2013, the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was $833 million, compared with $858 million at July 28, 2012. Some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including, among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return. 69Table of ContentsForeign Currency Exchange RiskOur foreign exchange forward and option contracts outstanding at fiscal year-end are summarized in U.S. dollar equivalents as follows (in millions): July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair ValueForward contracts: Purchased$3,472 $7 $3,336 $(10)Sold$1,401 $(5) $1,566 $5Option contracts: Purchased$716 $23 $2,478 $31Sold$696 $(4) $2,239 $(25)We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our sales are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations.Approximately 70% of our operating expenses are U.S.-dollar denominated. In fiscal 2013, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased our combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by $227 million, or approximately 1.3%, compared with fiscal 2012, and in fiscal 2012, they increased our combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by $90 million, or approximately 0.5% as compared with fiscal 2011. To reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by non-U.S.-dollar denominated operating expenses and costs, we hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts. These hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons. In designing a specific hedging approach, we consider several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of exposures, costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument, and potential effectiveness of the hedge. The gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales.We also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities. The market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables, investments, and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances. Our forward and option contracts generally have the following maturities: MaturitiesForward and option contracts—forecasted transactions related to operating expenses and service cost of sales Up to 18 monthsForward contracts—current assets and liabilities Up to 3 monthsForward contracts—net investments in foreign subsidiaries Up to 6 monthsForward contracts—long-term customer financings Up to 2 yearsWe do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for trading purposes.70Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:09:29.346301

Within the total revenue change, product revenue decreased 5% and service revenue increased 4%. Total gross margin decreased by 1.7 percentage points, driven by unfavorable impacts from pricing and mix partially offset by productivity improvements and also due to the $655 million charge to product cost of sales recorded in fiscal 2014 related to the expected cost of remediation of issues with memory components in certain products sold in prior fiscal years. Despite a slight year-over-year decline in absolute dollars, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, increased by 1.1 percentage points as a percentage of revenue due to the decline in revenue. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 3.2 percentage points. Diluted earnings per share decreased by 20% from the prior year, driven by a 21% decrease in net income. The decrease in net income in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was also attributable to net tax benefits in fiscal 2013 related to a settlement with the IRS and reinstatement of the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit.Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013—Business SummaryIn fiscal 2014, revenue decreased by $1.5 billion as compared with fiscal 2013. Revenue from the Americas decreased by $0.9 billion, driven by lower product revenue in most countries in this segment including the United States. While we experienced relative stability across Europe, EMEA revenue decreased $0.2 billion, led by product revenue declines in Russia as well as various other countries in this segment. Revenue in our APJC segment decreased $0.4 billion, led by product revenue declines in Japan and India. The weakness we encountered in emerging countries throughout the world in the later part of fiscal 2013 continued during fiscal 2014. The emerging countries of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and Mexico (“BRICM”), in the aggregate, experienced an 11% product revenue decline, with declines across all of our customer markets. We believe that the product revenue declines in many of these emerging countries were driven by the impact of economic and geopolitical challenges in these countries. While we saw some improvement in our business momentum in emerging countries in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2014, we experienced a decline in our business momentum in these countries during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2014, product revenue declined across all customer markets, with the most significant decline in the service provider market. Within the service provider market, the largest impacts came from the continued product revenue decline in our Service Provider Video category and the ongoing decline of product revenue in the emerging countries.From a product category perspective, the product revenue decrease of 5% year-over-year was driven in large part by the lower product revenue within our core routing and switching product categories. While we saw improvement in business momentum with respect to high-end routers during the second half of fiscal 2014, there was only a limited revenue contribution related to some of our recently introduced products, as product transitions in this area are still in their early stages. The effects of these product transitions, combined with other challenges, led to a decrease in NGN Routing revenue of 7%. We also experienced a 5% decrease in revenue from our Switching products. The other major product categories experienced revenue changes ranging from an 18% decrease in Service Provider Video to a 27% increase in Data Center. The decrease in revenue from our Service Provider Video products was driven largely by a decrease in revenue from sales of set-top boxes. Partially offsetting the decline in product revenue was an increase in service revenue. Service revenue increased by 4%, reflecting continued slower growth compared with prior years, which we believe was attributable to the impact of the declines in product revenue in recent periods. As we continue to focus on investing in growth, innovation, and talent, while managing costs and driving efficiencies, we announced a restructuring plan that will impact up to 6,000 employees, representing approximately 8% of our global workforce. We expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from the restructuring actions in our key growth areas such as data center, software, security, and cloud.In summary, while we saw some improved business momentum in the second half of fiscal 2014, we experienced many challenges during fiscal 2014 including reduced spending by our service provider customers, weakness in emerging countries, the impact of product transitions, and a conservative approach to IT-related capital spending by customers. We expect that the challenges in the emerging countries, the service provider customer market, and product transitions in Switching and NGN Routing may continue for at least the next several quarters. 37Table of ContentsFourth Quarter SnapshotFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2013, total revenue was flat. Within the total revenue change, product revenue declined by 2% and service revenue increased by 5%. With regard to our geographic segment performance, on a year-over-year basis, revenue in the Americas and in EMEA both decreased by 1% while we experienced a slight increase by 1% in our APJC segment. Total gross margin increased by 0.7 percentage points, primarily due to the TiVo patent litigation settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively increased by 1.0 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 1.0 percentage points, primarily as a result of higher restructuring and other charges, and also the impact of our revenue decrease. Diluted earnings per share increased by 2% from the prior year, primarily as a result of a decrease in our diluted share count.Strategy and Focus AreasOur strategy is to deliver the integrated architectures, solutions, and outcomes to help our customers grow, manage costs, and mitigate risk. We see our customers, in almost every industry, becoming increasingly reliant on technology—and specifically the network—to meet their business objectives and compete successfully in the market. Our focus continues to be on capitalizing on market transitions to maintain leadership in our core markets and to enter new markets where the network is foundational. We believe this focus best positions us to become a more relevant and trusted partner to our customers and to expand our share of our customers’ IT spending. We are focused on driving the innovation, speed, agility, and efficiencies in our company required to deliver leading technology solutions for our customers and shareholder value for our investors. Over the last few years, we have been working to transform our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions, as well as to meet customers' business outcomes. As a part of this transformation, we are making changes to how we are organized and how we deliver our technology. We believe these changes enable us to better meet our customers’ requirements and help them stay ahead of market transitions. For a full discussion of our strategy and focus areas, see Item 1. Business.Other Key Financial MeasuresThe following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 (in millions, except days sales outstanding in accounts receivable (DSO) and annualized inventory turns): Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013Cash and cash equivalents and investments $52,074 $50,610Cash provided by operating activities $12,332 $12,894Deferred revenue $14,142 $13,423Repurchases of common stock—stock repurchase program $9,539 $2,773Dividends $3,758 $3,310DSO 38 days 40 daysInventories $1,591 $1,476Annualized inventory turns 12.7 13.8Our product backlog at the end of fiscal 2014 was $5.4 billion, or 12% of fiscal 2014 total revenue, compared with $4.9 billion at the end of fiscal 2013, or 10% of fiscal 2013 total revenue.38Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met:•Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Contracts, Internet commerce agreements, and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.•Delivery has occurred. Shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery.•The fee is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.•Collectibility is reasonably assured. We assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer’s payment history.In instances where final acceptance of the product, system, or solution is specified by the customer, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. When a sale involves multiple deliverables, such as sales of products that include services, the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting, and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price. Revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met. For hosting arrangements, we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the subscription period, while usage revenue is recognized based on utilization. Software subscription revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription term upon delivery of the first product and commencement of the term. The amount of product and service revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and, if so, our valuation of the units of accounting for multiple deliverables. According to the accounting guidance prescribed in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605, Revenue Recognition, we use vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE) for each of those units, when available. We determine VSOE based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the historical standalone transactions have the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range, generally evidenced by approximately 80% of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus 15% of the median rates. When VSOE does not exist, we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multiple-deliverable arrangements. Under the selling price hierarchy, third-party evidence of selling price (TPE) will be considered if VSOE does not exist, and estimated selling price (ESP) will be used if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Generally, we are not able to determine TPE because our go-to-market strategy differs from that of others in our markets, and the extent of our proprietary technology varies among comparable products or services from those of our peers. In determining ESP, we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors, based on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement. We typically arrive at an ESP for a product or service that is not sold separately by considering company-specific factors such as geographies, competitive landscape, internal costs, profitability objectives, pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing, and existing portfolio pricing and discounting. Some of our sales arrangements have multiple deliverables containing software and related software support components. Such sales arrangements are subject to the accounting guidance in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition.As our business and offerings evolve over time, our pricing practices may be required to be modified accordingly, which could result in changes in selling prices, including both VSOE and ESP, in subsequent periods. There were no material impacts during fiscal 2014, nor do we currently expect a material impact in the next 12 months on our revenue recognition due to any changes in our VSOE, TPE, or ESP. Revenue deferrals relate to the timing of revenue recognition for specific transactions based on financing arrangements, service, support, and other factors. Financing arrangements may include sales-type, direct-financing, and operating leases, loans, and guarantees of third-party financing. Our deferred revenue for products was $4.5 billion and $4.0 billion as of July 26, 2014 and July 27, 2013, respectively. Technical support services revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed, which typically is from one to three years. Advanced services revenue is recognized upon delivery or completion of performance. Our deferred revenue for services was $9.6 billion and $9.4 billion as of July 26, 2014 and July 27, 2013, respectively.39Table of ContentsWe make sales to distributors which we refer to as two-tier systems of sales to the end customer. Revenue from distributors is recognized based on a sell-through method using information provided by them. Our distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs. If actual credits received by our distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.Allowances for Receivables and Sales ReturnsThe allowances for receivables were as follows (in millions, except percentages): July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013Allowance for doubtful accounts $265 $228Percentage of gross accounts receivable 4.9% 4.0%Allowance for credit loss—lease receivables $233 $238Percentage of gross lease receivables 6.2% 6.3%Allowance for credit loss—loan receivables $98 $86Percentage of gross loan receivables 5.8% 5.2%The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience, credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay and expected default frequency rates, which are published by major third-party credit-rating agencies and are generally updated on a quarterly basis. We also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts. If a major customer’s creditworthiness deteriorates, if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, or if other circumstances arise, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, and additional allowances could be required, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.The allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis. When evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis, we consider historical experience, credit quality and age of receivable balances, and economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. When evaluating financing receivables on a collective basis, we use expected default frequency rates published by a major third-party credit-rating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default, while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions, concentration of risk and correlation. Determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings, as well as assessing factors such as economic conditions, concentration of risk, and correlation, are complex and subjective. Our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results. Both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible.A reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. The reserve for future sales returns as of July 26, 2014 and July 27, 2013 was $135 million and $119 million, respectively, and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable. If the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established, our revenue could be adversely affected. Inventory Valuation and Liability for Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and SuppliersOur inventory balance was $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion as of July 26, 2014 and July 27, 2013, respectively. Inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories, determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of our cost of sales. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. As of July 26, 2014, the liability for these purchase commitments was $162 million, compared with $172 million as of July 27, 2013, and was included in other current liabilities.40Table of ContentsOur provision for inventory was $67 million, $114 million, and $115 million for fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. The provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was $124 million, $106 million, and $151 million in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we could be required to increase our inventory write-downs, and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and accordingly our profitability, could be adversely affected. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments. Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence, particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainties and conditions and the resulting potential for changes in future demand forecast. Loss Contingencies and Product WarrantiesWe are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.We have recorded a liability for the expected remediation cost for certain products sold in prior fiscal years containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010. In February 2014, on the basis of the growing number of failures as described in Note 12 (f) to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we decided to expand our approach, which resulted in an additional charge to product cost of sales of $655 million being recorded for the second quarter of fiscal 2014. Estimating this liability is complex and subjective, and if we experience changes in a number of underlying assumptions and estimates such as a change in claims compared with our expectations, or if the cost of servicing these claims is different than expected, our estimated liability may be impacted.Our liability for product warranties, included in other current liabilities, was $446 million as of July 26, 2014, compared with $402 million as of July 27, 2013. Our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years, and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty. We accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs, technical support labor costs, and associated overhead. Material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment. Technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period. Overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities.The provision for product warranties during fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012 was $704 million, $649 million, and $617 million, respectively. If we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected, our profitability could be adversely affected.Fair Value MeasurementsOur fixed income and publicly traded equity securities, collectively, are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at a fair value of $45.3 billion as of July 26, 2014, compared with $42.7 billion as of July 27, 2013. Our fixed income investment portfolio, as of July 26, 2014, consisted primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.As described more fully in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a valuation hierarchy is based on the level of independent, objective evidence available regarding the value of the investments. It encompasses three classes of investments: Level 1 consists of securities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical securities; Level 2 consists of securities for which observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs are used, such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets and model-derived valuations for which the variables are derived from, or corroborated by, observable market data; and Level 3 consists of securities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value.41Table of ContentsOur Level 2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. We use inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from independent pricing vendors, quoted market prices, or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities. We use such pricing data as the primary input, to which we have not made any material adjustments during fiscal 2014 and 2013, to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio. We are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates.The inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness, may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information, and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to its estimate of fair value. The assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective. However, given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio, and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets, we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of subjectivity and judgment was material to the valuation of the investment portfolio as of July 26, 2014. Level 3 assets do not represent a significant portion of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of July 26, 2014.Other-than-Temporary Impairments We recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary. The ultimate value realized on these securities, to the extent unhedged, is subject to market price volatility until they are sold.If the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary. An impairment is considered other than temporary if (i) we have the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on (i) or (ii) described in the prior sentence, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (iii), the amount representing credit loss, defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security, will be recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). In estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected, we consider all available information, including past events, current conditions, the remaining payment terms of the security, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults, and the value of underlying collateral.For publicly traded equity securities, we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.For fiscal 2014, impairment charges of $11 million on our investments in publicly traded equity securities were recognized in earnings, while there were no such impairment charges in fiscal 2013 and 2012. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income.We also have investments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages. As of July 26, 2014, our investments in privately held companies were $899 million, compared with $833 million as of July 27, 2013, and were included in other assets. We monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment, and we make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required, based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. Our impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were $23 million, $33 million, and $23 million in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Asset ImpairmentsOur methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.42Table of ContentsThe goodwill recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 26, 2014 and July 27, 2013 was $24.2 billion and $21.9 billion, respectively. The increase in goodwill for fiscal 2014 was due in large part to our acquisition of Sourcefire, Inc. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill resulting from our annual impairment testing in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012. For the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2014, the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was $32.0 billion for the Americas, $22.0 billion for EMEA, and $16.2 billion for APJC. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. There were no impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets during fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013. Our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were $12 million during fiscal 2012. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R&D tax credits, domestic manufacturing deductions, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, international realignments, and transfer pricing adjustments. Our effective tax rate was 19.2%, 11.1%, and 20.8% in fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by expiration of or lapses in the R&D tax credit or domestic manufacturing deduction laws; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany R&D cost-sharing arrangement and legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including possible changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 34 countries, including the United States, is contemplating changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. These contemplated changes, if finalized and adopted by countries, will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. As a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.43Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSRevenueThe following table presents the breakdown of revenue between product and service (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentRevenue: Product $36,172 $38,029 $(1,857) (4.9)% $38,029 $36,326 $1,703 4.7%Percentage of revenue 76.7% 78.2% 78.2% 78.9% Service 10,970 10,578 392 3.7 % 10,578 9,735 843 8.7%Percentage of revenue 23.3% 21.8% 21.8% 21.1% Total $47,142 $48,607 $(1,465) (3.0)% $48,607 $46,061 $2,546 5.5%We manage our business primarily on a geographic basis, organized into three geographic segments. Our revenue, which includes product and service for each segment, is summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentRevenue: Americas $27,781 $28,639 $(858) (3.0)% $28,639 $26,501 $2,138 8.1%Percentage of revenue 58.9% 58.9% 58.9% 57.5% EMEA 12,006 12,210 (204) (1.7)% 12,210 12,075 135 1.1%Percentage of revenue 25.5% 25.1% 25.1% 26.2% APJC 7,355 7,758 (403) (5.2)% 7,758 7,485 273 3.6%Percentage of revenue 15.6% 16.0% 16.0% 16.3% Total $47,142 $48,607 $(1,465) (3.0)% $48,607 $46,061 $2,546 5.5%Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013 For fiscal 2014, as compared with fiscal 2013, total revenue decreased by 3%. Product revenue decreased by 5%, while service revenue increased by 4%. The decrease in product revenue reflected declines across all geographic segments as well as across all customer markets. Service revenues experienced slower growth in our Americas and APJC geographic segments while we experienced slightly faster growth in the EMEA segment. Across our geographic segments, product revenue for most of our emerging countries experienced a decline. The emerging countries of BRICM, in the aggregate, experienced an 11% product revenue decline, with declines across all of our customer markets. We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations. Our revenue in fiscal 2014 may have been adversely affected by the depreciation of the local currency relative to the U.S. dollar in certain emerging countries, although such indirect effects are difficult to measure, as noted.In addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced IT spending environment and budget-driven reductions in spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple-element arrangements; the mix of financing arrangements provided to our channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment. As has been the case in certain of our emerging countries from time to time, customers require greater levels of financing arrangements, service, and support, and these activities may occur in future periods, which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue.44Table of ContentsFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012 For fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, total revenue increased by 6%. Within total revenue growth, product revenue increased by 5%, while service revenue increased by 9%. Our product and service revenue totals reflected revenue growth across each of our geographic segments. The revenue increase was primarily due to the following: the solid performance of our Service offerings, our acquisition of NDS at the beginning of fiscal 2013, and increased demand for our Data Center and Wireless products.Product Revenue by SegmentThe following table presents the breakdown of product revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentProduct revenue: Americas $20,631 $21,653 $(1,022) (4.7)% $21,653 $20,168 $1,485 7.4%Percentage of product revenue 57.0% 57.0% 57.0% 55.5% EMEA 9,655 10,049 (394) (3.9)% 10,049 10,024 25 0.2%Percentage of product revenue 26.7% 26.4% 26.4% 27.6% APJC 5,886 6,327 (441) (7.0)% 6,327 6,134 193 3.1%Percentage of product revenue 16.3% 16.6% 16.6% 16.9% Total $36,172 $38,029 $(1,857) (4.9)% $38,029 $36,326 $1,703 4.7%AmericasFiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013Product revenue in the Americas segment decreased by 5%, led by a significant decline in the service provider market and, to a lesser extent, declines in the public sector and commercial markets. Product revenue declined in the U.S. public sector market, led by lower sales to the U.S. federal government. From a country perspective, product revenue decreased by 5% in the United States, 10% in Canada, and 13% in Brazil, partially offset by an increase of 2% in Mexico. Fiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012For fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, product revenue in the Americas segment increased by 7%. The increase in product revenue was across most of our customer markets in the Americas segment, led by solid growth in the service provider and commercial markets and, to a lesser degree, growth in the enterprise market. The growth in product revenue in the service provider market was due in large part to our acquisition of NDS at the beginning of fiscal 2013. Within the Americas segment, we experienced a product revenue decline in the public sector market, driven by lower sales to the public sector in the United States. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 9% in the United States, 13% in Brazil, and 7% in Mexico. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we experienced some weakness in our business momentum in certain countries within Latin America. EMEAFiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013Product revenue in the EMEA segment decreased by 4%, led by a decline in the service provider market and, to a lesser extent, declines in the enterprise and public sector markets. Product revenue from emerging countries within EMEA decreased by 11%, led by a 24% decrease in Russia. Product revenue for the remainder of EMEA, which is primarily composed of countries in western Europe, declined by 2%.45Table of ContentsFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012In fiscal 2013, we experienced a continuation of many of the macroeconomic challenges we faced in EMEA in fiscal 2012. While we did see some improvements in most of the European economy as the fiscal year progressed, we continued to see weakness in southern Europe throughout fiscal 2013. For fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, product revenue in the EMEA segment was flat, as growth in the commercial, service provider and public sector markets was offset by a decline in the enterprise market. The growth in product revenue in the service provider market was due to our acquisition of NDS at the beginning of fiscal 2013. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 1% in the United Kingdom, 11% in Russia, 4% in Switzerland, and 3% in Spain. These increases were offset by product revenue declines of 3% in each of Germany and France and 13% in the Netherlands. Product revenue for Italy was flat year over year. APJCFiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013Product revenue in the APJC segment decreased by 7%, led by declines in the service provider and enterprise markets and, to a lesser extent, a decline in the commercial market. We continued to experience declines in many of the emerging countries within this segment, most notably in India which experienced a year-over-year product revenue decline of 15%. Other countries that contributed to the weakness in this segment included Japan, Australia, and China, which experienced year-over-year product revenue declines of 11%, 7%, and 6%, respectively. Fiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012For fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, product revenue in the APJC segment increased by 3%. We experienced solid product revenue growth in the commercial and service provider markets and, to a lesser degree, in the public sector market. The growth in product revenue in the service provider market was due primarily to our acquisition of NDS at the beginning of fiscal 2013. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 3% in Australia, 34% in India, and 10% in South Korea. These increases were partially offset by product revenue declines of 5% in China and 7% in Japan, reflecting certain challenges that we faced in these countries during portions of fiscal 2013, most notably in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.46Table of ContentsProduct Revenue by Groups of Similar ProductsIn addition to the primary view on a geographic basis, we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes. Our product categories consist of the following categories (with subcategories in parentheses): Switching (fixed switching, modular switching, and storage); NGN Routing (high-end routers, mid-range and low-end routers, and other NGN Routing products); Service Provider Video (infrastructure, video software and solutions); Collaboration (unified communications, Cisco TelePresence, and conferencing); Data Center; Wireless; Security; and Other Products. The Other Products category consists primarily of emerging technology products and other networking products.The following table presents revenue for groups of similar products (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentProduct revenue: Switching $14,056 $14,767 $(711) (4.8)% $14,767 $14,634 $133 0.9 %Percentage of product revenue 38.9% 38.8% 38.8% 40.3% NGN Routing 7,662 8,243 (581) (7.0)% 8,243 8,395 (152) (1.8)%Percentage of product revenue 21.2% 21.7% 21.7% 23.1% Service Provider Video 3,969 4,855 (886) (18.2)% 4,855 3,869 986 25.5 %Percentage of product revenue 11.0% 12.8% 12.8% 10.7% Collaboration 3,734 3,956 (222) (5.6)% 3,956 4,194 (238) (5.7)%Percentage of product revenue 10.3% 10.4% 10.4% 11.5% Data Center 2,640 2,074 566 27.3 % 2,074 1,298 776 59.8 %Percentage of product revenue 7.3% 5.5% 5.5% 3.6% Wireless 2,265 2,228 37 1.7 % 2,228 1,697 531 31.3 %Percentage of product revenue 6.3% 5.9% 5.9% 4.7% Security 1,566 1,348 218 16.2 % 1,348 1,341 7 0.5 %Percentage of product revenue 4.3% 3.5% 3.5% 3.7% Other 280 558 (278) (49.8)% 558 898 (340) (37.9)%Percentage of product revenue 0.7% 1.4% 1.4% 2.4% Total $36,172 $38,029 $(1,857) (4.9)% $38,029 $36,326 $1,703 4.7 %SwitchingFiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013Revenue in our Switching product category decreased by 5%, or $711 million, driven by a 12%, or $656 million, decrease in revenue from our modular switches. Revenue from our modular switches decreased due to lower sales of Cisco Catalyst 6000 Series Switches. We also experienced a 3% decrease in sales of storage products within this category. Revenue from our LAN fixed-configuration switches was relatively flat year over year, as lower sales of most of our fixed-configuration Cisco Catalyst Series Switches and fixed-configuration Cisco Nexus Series Switches were offset by the continued adoption of Cisco Catalyst 3850 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 6000 Series Switches. 47Table of ContentsFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012Product revenue in our Switching category increased by 1%, or $133 million as higher sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches were partially offset by lower sales of modular switches and storage products. Sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches increased by 4%, or $347 million, while sales of modular switches decreased by 1%, or approximately $76 million. The increase in sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches was primarily due to higher sales of Cisco Nexus Series Switches, partially offset by sales declines in certain of our Cisco Catalyst product families. Sales of modular switches decreased due to lower sales of Cisco Catalyst 6000 Series Switches, partially offset by higher sales in Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches. Product revenue in the Switching category was also negatively impacted by a 24% decrease in sales of storage products. NGN RoutingFiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013The decrease in revenue in our NGN Routing product category of 7%, or $581 million, was driven by a 6%, or $278 million, decrease in revenue from high-end router products; a 9%, or $249 million, decrease in revenue from our midrange and low-end router products; and an 8%, or $54 million, decrease in revenue from other NGN Routing products. Revenue from our high-end products decreased due to lower sales of Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System products and our legacy high-end router products, partially offset by increased sales of our Cisco Aggregation Services Routers (ASR) edge products. The decrease in revenue from our midrange and low-end router products was driven by lower sales of our Cisco Integrated Services Routers (ISR) products. Revenue from other NGN Routing products decreased due to lower sales of certain optical networking products.Fiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012Sales in our NGN Routing product category decreased by 2%, or $152 million, driven by a 3%, or $141 million, decrease in sales of high-end router products and an 8%, or $58 million, decrease in sales of other NGN Routing products. These decreases were partially offset by a 2%, or $47 million, increase in sales of our midrange and low-end router products. Within the high-end router product category, we experienced lower sales of our Cisco CRS-1 and CRS-3 Carrier Routing System products and our legacy high-end router products, partially offset by continued adoption of our Cisco ASR products. Higher sales in our midrange and low-end router products were driven by the continued adoption of our Cisco ISR platform. The decline in sales of other NGN Routing products was due to decreased sales of certain other routing and optical networking products. Service Provider VideoFiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013Revenue in our Service Provider Video product category decreased by 18%, or $886 million, with the largest driver of the decline being a 21%, or $812 million, decrease in sales of our Service Provider Video infrastructure products. The revenue decline in Service Provider Video infrastructure products, which includes connected devices products, was due primarily to lower sales of set-top boxes.Fiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012Our Service Provider Video products category grew by 25%, or $986 million, due primarily to the acquisition of NDS at the beginning of fiscal 2013. Higher revenue from our Service Provider Video infrastructure products also contributed to the increase. The increase in sales of our Service Provider Video infrastructure products was primarily due to increased sales of set-top boxes. CollaborationFiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013We continue to increase the proportion of recurring revenue in our Collaboration product category. Overall, revenue in our Collaboration product category decreased by 6%, or $222 million, primarily due to decreased revenue from our Cisco TelePresence and Unified Communications products, driven by weakness in endpoint products such as phones. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenue from our conferencing products. Fiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012Sales of Collaboration products decreased by 6%, or $238 million, primarily due to a decline in sales of Cisco TelePresence Systems and, to a lesser degree, a decline in sales of Unified Communications products. Lower public sector spending in the United States, as well as demand weakness in Europe, were significant drivers of the decline in sales of Cisco TelePresence Systems. We also experienced a decline in sales of Unified Communications products, which was due primarily to lower sales of Unified Communications infrastructure products as a result of our sales emphasis on shifting towards products with recurring revenue streams. 48Table of ContentsData CenterFiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013We continue to experience solid growth in our Data Center product category, which grew by 27%, or $566 million, with sales growth of our Cisco Unified Computing System products across all geographic segments and customer markets. The increase was due in large part to the continued momentum we are experiencing in both data center and cloud environments, as current customers increase their data center build-outs, and as new customers deploy these offerings. To the extent our data center business grows and further penetrates the market, we expect that, in comparison to what we experienced during the initial rapid growth of this business, the growth rates for our data center product sales will experience more normal seasonality consistent with the overall server market. Fiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012We experienced strong growth in our Data Center product category, which grew by 60%, or $776 million, with strong sales growth of our Cisco Unified Computing System products across all geographic segments and customer markets. The increase was due in large part to the continued momentum we are experiencing with our products for both data center and cloud environments, as current customers increase their data center build-outs and as new customers deploy these offerings. WirelessFiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013We continue to increase the proportion of recurring revenue in our Wireless product category. Revenue in our Wireless product category increased by 2%, or $37 million, due to an increase in sales of Meraki products, which we acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, partially offset by lower sales of other wireless products.Fiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012Sales of Wireless products increased by 31%, or $531 million. This increase reflects the continued customer adoption of and migration to the unified access architecture of the Cisco Unified Wireless Network, and also reflects increased sales of new products in this category as well as sales of products related to our acquisition of Meraki. SecurityFiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013We continue to increase the proportion of recurring revenue in our Security product category. Revenue in our Security product category was up 16%, or $218 million, driven primarily by sales of Sourcefire products, which company we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and, to a lesser degree, by both higher sales of our high-end firewall products within our network security product portfolio and slightly higher sales of our content security products. Fiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012Sales of Security products were flat as higher sales in high-end firewall products within our network security product portfolio were offset by lower sales of our content security products.Other ProductsWe experienced a year-over-year decrease in revenue in our Other Products category for both fiscal 2014 and 2013, due in large part to the sale of our Linksys product line in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.49Table of ContentsService Revenue by SegmentThe following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages):Years EndedJuly 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentService revenue: Americas$7,150 $6,986 $164 2.3% $6,986 $6,333 $653 10.3%Percentage of service revenue65.2% 66.1% 66.1% 65.0% EMEA2,351 2,161 190 8.8% 2,161 2,051 110 5.4%Percentage of service revenue21.4% 20.4% 20.4% 21.1% APJC1,469 1,431 38 2.7% 1,431 1,351 80 5.9%Percentage of service revenue13.4% 13.5% 13.5% 13.9% Total$10,970 $10,578 $392 3.7% $10,578 $9,735 $843 8.7%Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013Service revenue continued to experience slower growth than in prior fiscal years, with varying levels of growth across our geographic segments. Worldwide technical support services revenue increased by 4% while worldwide advanced services revenue experienced 3% growth. Technical support service revenue experienced growth across all geographic segments. Renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with product sales provided an installed base of equipment being serviced which, in concert with new service offerings, were the primary factors driving the revenue increases. Advanced services revenue, which relates to consulting support services for specific customer network needs, slightly declined in the Americas segment but had solid growth in the EMEA and APJC segments due to growth in subscription revenues. Fiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012Service revenue experienced solid growth across all of our geographic segments. Worldwide technical support services revenue increased by 6%, and worldwide advanced services experienced 16% revenue growth. Technical support service experienced growth across all of our geographic segments, led by growth in our Americas segment. Renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with product sales provided an installed base of equipment being serviced which, in concert with new service offerings, were the primary factors driving these increases. We experienced revenue growth in advanced services across all geographic segments, led by growth in the Americas segment. Advanced services revenue growth was driven by solid growth in both transaction and subscription revenues. 50Table of ContentsGross MarginThe following table presents the gross margin for products and services (in millions, except percentages): AMOUNT PERCENTAGEYears EndedJuly 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012Gross margin: Product$20,531 $22,488 $21,821 56.8% 59.1% 60.1%Service7,238 6,952 6,388 66.0% 65.7% 65.6%Total$27,769 $29,440 $28,209 58.9% 60.6% 61.2%Product Gross MarginFiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013The following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014: Product Gross Margin PercentageFiscal 2013 59.1 %Product pricing (3.1)%Supplier component remediation charge (1.8)%Mix of products sold (0.5)%Amortization of purchased intangible assets (0.5)%Productivity (1) 3.0 %TiVo patent litigation settlement 0.5 %Acquisition fair value adjustment to inventory and other 0.1 %Fiscal 2014 56.8 % (1) Productivity includes overall manufacturing-related costs, shipment volume, and other items not categorized elsewhere.Product gross margin decreased by 2.3 percentage points compared with fiscal 2013. The decrease in product gross margin was driven by unfavorable impacts from product pricing, which were driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets. The decrease was also due, in part, to the charge of $655 million to product cost of sales recorded in fiscal 2014 related to the expected cost of remediation of issues with memory components in certain products sold in prior fiscal years. In addition, the shift in the mix of products sold decreased our product gross margin, primarily as a result of a revenue increase in our relatively lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products and decreased revenue from our higher margin core products, partially offset by decreased revenue from our relatively lower margin Service Provider Video products. Our product gross margin for fiscal 2014 was also negatively impacted by higher amortization expense of purchased intangible assets. For further explanation of the increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets, see “Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets” below. These amounts were partially offset by productivity benefits and the absence of charges related to the TiVo patent litigation settlement which we incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. The productivity benefits we experienced in fiscal 2014 were driven by value engineering efforts; favorable component pricing; and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations. Value engineering is the process by which production costs are reduced through component redesign, board configuration, test processes, and transformation processes. Our future gross margins could be impacted by our product mix and could be adversely affected by further growth in sales of products that have lower gross margins, such as Cisco Unified Computing System products. Our gross margins may also be impacted by the geographic mix of our revenue and, as was the case in fiscal 2014, fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, may be adversely affected by product pricing attributable to competitive factors. Additionally, our manufacturing-related costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain, which in turn could negatively affect gross margin. If any of the preceding factors that in the past have negatively impacted our gross margins arise in future periods, our gross margins could continue to decline.51Table of ContentsFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012The following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013: Product Gross Margin PercentageFiscal 2012 60.1 %Product pricing (2.9)%Mix of products sold (0.7)%Productivity 3.7 %TiVo patent litigation settlement (0.5)%Amortization of purchased intangible assets (0.5)%Acquisition fair value adjustment to inventory and other (0.1)%Fiscal 2013 59.1 %Product gross margin decreased by 1.0 percentage points compared with fiscal 2012. Unfavorable impacts from product pricing contributed to our decreased product gross margin percentage in fiscal 2013. These factors impacted most of our customer markets and all of our geographic segments. Additionally, our product gross margin for fiscal 2013 was negatively impacted by the shift in the mix of products sold, primarily as a result of revenue increases for our relatively lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products. These impacts were offset by continued productivity improvements. The productivity improvements were in large part due to increased benefits from cost savings, particularly in certain of our Switching and NGN Routing categories in which product transitions have been taking place, and were driven by value engineering efforts, favorable component pricing, and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations. Because the preceding factors largely offset each other, the decline in our product gross margin percentage was largely driven by our acquisition of NDS, which resulted in higher amortization expense from purchased intangible assets along with costs resulting from a fair value adjustment to inventory acquired as part of that acquisition. In addition, during fiscal 2013 we incurred charges related to the TiVo patent litigation settlement in the fourth quarter that were included as part of cost of sales. The combined effect of these items was a negative impact to our product gross margin of 1.1 percentage points for fiscal 2013. Service Gross MarginFiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013Our service gross margin percentage increased slightly by 0.3 percentage points for fiscal 2014, as compared with fiscal 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume in both advanced services and technical support services. The benefits to gross margin of increased sales volume were partially offset by increased cost impacts such as outside service costs, partner delivery costs, and headcount-related costs.Our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. Other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services.Fiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012Our service gross margin percentage increased slightly by 0.1 percentage points for fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012. Although we experienced higher sales volume from growth in both advanced services and in technical support services, the resulting benefit to gross margin was offset by increased cost impacts such as headcount-related costs, partner delivery costs, and unfavorable mix. The mix impacts were due to our lower gross margin advanced services business contributing a higher proportion of service revenue for fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012. 52Table of ContentsGross Margin by SegmentThe following table presents the total gross margin for each segment (in millions, except percentages): AMOUNT PERCENTAGEYears Ended July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012Gross margin: Americas $17,379 $17,887 $16,639 62.6% 62.5% 62.8%EMEA 7,700 7,876 7,605 64.1% 64.5% 63.0%APJC 4,252 4,637 4,519 57.8% 59.8% 60.4%Segment total 29,331 30,400 28,763 62.2% 62.5% 62.4%Unallocated corporate items (1) (1,562) (960) (554) Total $27,769 $29,440 $28,209 58.9% 60.6% 61.2% (1) The unallocated corporate items for the years presented include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant litigation and other contingencies, impacts to cost of sales from purchase accounting adjustments to inventory, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges. We do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments. Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013The Americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage increase due to the impact of productivity improvements in this geographic segment. Partially offsetting this favorable impact to gross margin were negative impacts from pricing and an unfavorable mix. The unfavorable mix impact was driven by revenue increases in our relatively lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products and lower sales of our higher margin core products, partially offset by decreased revenue from our relatively lower margin Service Provider Video products. The gross margin percentage decrease in our EMEA segment was due primarily to the unfavorable impacts from pricing, as well as an unfavorable mix impact, partially offset by productivity improvements in this geographic segment. The unfavorable mix impact was driven by an increase in revenue from our lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products.Our APJC segment gross margin percentage decreased primarily as a result of unfavorable impacts from pricing, and also as a result of an unfavorable mix. The unfavorable mix impact was driven by an increase in revenue from our lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products. Partially offsetting these factors were impacts from productivity improvements and higher service gross margin in this geographic segment.The gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment. Our product and service gross margins may be impacted by economic downturns or uncertain economic conditions as well as our movement into new market opportunities, and could decline if any of the factors that impact our gross margins are adversely affected in future periods. Fiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012We experienced a gross margin percentage decrease in our Americas and APJC segments, while our EMEA segment experienced a gross margin percentage increase. The Americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage decline due to the unfavorable impacts from pricing, and also due to unfavorable mix impacts, partially offset by productivity improvements. The gross margin percentage increase in our EMEA segment was primarily the result of productivity improvements from lower overall manufacturing costs and, to a lesser degree, favorable mix impacts and higher service gross margin. Partially offsetting these favorable impacts to gross margin were negative impacts from pricing. The APJC segment gross margin percentage declined due primarily to the unfavorable impacts from pricing, lower service gross margin, and unfavorable mix impacts. Partially offsetting these factors were productivity improvements, driven in large part by lower overall manufacturing costs and higher volume.53Table of ContentsFactors That May Impact Revenue and Gross MarginProduct revenue may continue to be affected by factors, including global economic downturns and related market uncertainty, that have resulted in reduced IT-related capital spending in certain segments within our enterprise, service provider, public sector, and commercial markets; changes in the geopolitical environment and global economic conditions; competition, including price-focused competitors from Asia, especially from China; new product introductions; sales cycles and product implementation cycles; changes in the mix of our customers between service provider and enterprise markets; changes in the mix of direct sales and indirect sales; variations in sales channels; and final acceptance criteria of the product, system, or solution as specified by the customer. Sales to the service provider market have been and may be in the future characterized by large and sporadic purchases, especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain products within our Collaboration, Data Center, and Service Provider Video product categories. In addition, service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader range of services, including network design services; and often have acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition. Certain of our customers in certain emerging countries also tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may similarly be affected by the timing of revenue recognition. As we focus on new market opportunities, customers may require greater levels of financing arrangements, service, and support, especially in certain emerging countries, which in turn may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition. To improve customer satisfaction, we continue to focus on managing our manufacturing lead-time performance, which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog. A decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quarter-to-quarter revenue and operating results.Product revenue may also be adversely affected by fluctuations in demand for our products, especially with respect to telecommunications service providers and Internet businesses, whether or not driven by any slowdown in capital expenditures in the service provider market; price and product competition in the communications and information technology industry; introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products; adoption of new networking standards; and financial difficulties experienced by our customers. We may, from time to time, experience manufacturing issues that create a delay in our suppliers’ ability to provide specific components, resulting in delayed shipments. To the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in periods when we and our suppliers are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters are not remediated within the same quarter. For additional factors that may impact product revenue, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Our distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs. Increased sales to our distributors generally result in greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and, to a certain degree, the timing of orders from our customers. We recognize revenue for sales to our distributors generally based on a sell-through method using information provided by them, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for all cooperative marketing and other programs.Product gross margin may be adversely affected in the future by changes in the mix of products sold, including periods of increased growth of some of our lower margin products; introduction of new products, including products with price-performance advantages and new business models for our offerings such as XaaS; our ability to reduce production costs; entry into new markets, including markets with different pricing structures and cost structures, as a result of internal development or through acquisitions; changes in distribution channels; price competition, including competitors from Asia, especially those from China; changes in geographic mix of our product revenue; the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals; sales discounts; increases in material or labor costs, including share-based compensation expense; excess inventory and obsolescence charges; warranty costs; changes in shipment volume; loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing; effects of value engineering; inventory holding charges; and the extent to which we successfully execute on our strategy and operating plans. Additionally, our manufacturing-related costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain. Service gross margin may be impacted by various factors such as the change in mix between technical support services and advanced services; the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals; share-based compensation expense; and the timing of our strategic investments in headcount and resources to support this business.54Table of ContentsResearch and Development (“R&D”), Sales and Marketing, and General and Administrative (“G&A”) ExpensesR&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses are summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentResearch and development $6,294 $5,942 $352 5.9 % $5,942 $5,488 $454 8.3 %Percentage of revenue 13.4% 12.2% 12.2% 11.9% Sales and marketing 9,503 9,538 (35) (0.4)% 9,538 9,647 (109) (1.1)%Percentage of revenue 20.2% 19.6% 19.6% 20.9% General and administrative 1,934 2,264 (330) (14.6)% 2,264 2,322 (58) (2.5)%Percentage of revenue 4.1% 4.7% 4.7% 5.0% Total $17,731 $17,744 $(13) (0.1)% $17,744 $17,457 $287 1.6 %Percentage of revenue 37.6% 36.5% 36.5% 37.9% R&D ExpensesFiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013R&D expenses increased for fiscal 2014, as compared with fiscal 2013, primarily due to compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2014 in connection with our acquisition of the remaining interest in Insieme Networks, Inc. (“Insieme”). See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Higher share-based compensation expense and higher contracted services also contributed to the increase. These increases were partially offset by reduced variable compensation expense as a result of our financial performance and efficiencies related to our workforce reduction plan announced in August 2013. We continue to invest in R&D in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. If we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal R&D.Fiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012The increase in R&D expenses for fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, was primarily due to higher headcount-related expenses attributable in large part to our acquisitions. Partially offsetting these costs was lower share-based compensation expense. Sales and Marketing ExpensesFiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013Sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2014, as compared with fiscal 2013, decreased slightly due to lower advertising expenses, reductions in other discretionary spending, and lower expenses in other areas such as depreciation expense. These decreases were substantially offset by higher share based compensation expense and higher acquisition- related costs. Fiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012For fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, sales and marketing expenses decreased by $109 million, primarily due to lower share-based compensation expense and, to a lesser degree, lower discretionary spending and contracted services. These items were partially offset by higher headcount-related expense resulting largely from our acquisitions.G&A ExpensesFiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013G&A expenses decreased in fiscal 2014, as compared with fiscal 2013, due to lower contracted services, lower corporate-level expenses, and lower headcount-related expenses. The lower headcount-related expenses were due to efficiencies related to our workforce reduction plan announced in August 2013, and also due to reduced variable compensation expense as a result of our lower financial performance.55Table of ContentsFiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012G&A expenses decreased in fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, primarily due to the absence in fiscal 2013 of $202 million of impairment charges on real estate held for sale recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. Lower share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2013 and a recovery in the market value of property held for sale recorded during fiscal 2013 also contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by higher headcount-related expenses resulting in part from our acquisitions and also by higher corporate-level expenses. Corporate-level expenses, which tend to vary from period to period, included operational infrastructure activities such as IT project implementations, which included investments in our global data center infrastructure, and investments related to operational and financial systems.Effect of Foreign CurrencyIn fiscal 2014, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by $153 million, or approximately 0.9%, compared with fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2013, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by $227 million, or approximately 1.3%, compared with fiscal 2012. HeadcountFiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013Our headcount decreased by approximately 1,000 employees in fiscal 2014. The decrease was due to headcount reductions from attrition and from our workforce reduction plan announced in August 2013. These headcount reductions were partially offset by the increase in headcount from targeted hiring in engineering, services, sales, and also by increased headcount from our recent acquisitions. In August 2014, we announced a restructuring plan that will impact up to 6,000 employees, representing approximately 8% of our global workforce. We expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from the restructuring actions in our key growth areas such as data center, software, security, and cloud.Fiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012Our headcount increased by 8,410 employees in fiscal 2013. The increase was attributable to the headcount from acquisitions, the largest of which was NDS, as well as targeted hiring in engineering and services.Share-Based Compensation ExpenseThe following table presents share-based compensation expense (in millions):Years Ended July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012Cost of sales—product $45 $40 $53Cost of sales—service 150 138 156Share-based compensation expense in cost of sales 195 178 209Research and development 411 286 401Sales and marketing 549 484 588General and administrative 198 175 203Restructuring and other charges (5) (3) —Share-based compensation expense in operating expenses 1,153 942 1,192Total share-based compensation expense $1,348 $1,120 $1,401The increase in share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2014, as compared with fiscal 2013, was due primarily to share-based compensation expense attributable to equity awards assumed with respect to our recent acquisitions and higher forfeiture credits in fiscal 2013. The decrease in share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, was due primarily to a decrease in the aggregate value of share-based awards granted in recent periods, higher forfeiture credits in fiscal 2013, and the effect of stock options awards from prior years becoming fully amortized and replaced with restricted stock units with a lower aggregate value.56Table of ContentsAmortization of Purchased Intangible AssetsThe following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets (in millions):Years Ended July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012Amortization of purchased intangible assets: Cost of sales $742 $606 $424Operating expenses 275 395 383Total $1,017 $1,001 $807Amortization of purchased intangible assets increased in both fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 as compared with the respective prior fiscal years. The increases were primarily due to amortization of purchased intangible assets from our recent acquisitions partially offset by certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized.The fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. We consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets. Restructuring and Other ChargesFiscal 2014 Plan and Fiscal 2011 Plans In August 2013, we announced a workforce reduction plan that would impact up to 4,000 employees, or 5%, of our global workforce. In connection with this Fiscal 2014 Plan, during fiscal 2014 we incurred within operating expenses restructuring and other charges of approximately $418 million which were related primarily to employee severance charges for employees impacted by our workforce reduction plan under the Fiscal 2014 Plan. We have completed the Fiscal 2014 Plan and we do not expect any remaining charges related to this action. In fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, we incurred within operating expenses net restructuring and other charges of $105 million and $304 million, respectively, which were related primarily to employee severance charges for employees impacted by our workforce reduction under Fiscal 2011 Plans. Fiscal 2015 PlanIn August 2014, we announced a restructuring plan that will impact up to 6,000 employees, representing approximately 8% of our global workforce. We expect to take action under this plan beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. We currently estimate that we will recognize pre-tax charges in an amount not expected to exceed $700 million consisting of severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other associated costs.Operating IncomeThe following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012Operating income $9,345 $11,196 $10,065Operating income as a percentage of revenue 19.8% 23.0% 21.9%For fiscal 2014, as compared with fiscal 2013, operating income decreased by 17%, and as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased by 3.2 percentage points. The decrease resulted from the following: a decrease in revenue; a gross margin percentage decline, driven in part by the $655 million supplier component remediation charge (or 1.4 percentage points); the $416 million compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2014 in connection with our acquisition of the remaining interest in Insieme; and an increase in restructuring and other charges related to the workforce reduction under the Fiscal 2014 Plan. In fiscal 2013 our results reflected solid execution on delivering profitable growth, as we grew operating income faster than revenue. In fiscal 2013, as compared with fiscal 2012, operating income increased by 11%, and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 1.1 percentage points. The increases resulted from the following: revenue growth of 6%; continuing focus on expense management, which resulted in lower sales and marketing and G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue; and lower restructuring and other charges. 57Table of ContentsInterest and Other Income (Loss), NetInterest Income (Expense), Net The following table summarizes interest income and interest expense (in millions):Years EndedJuly 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 Variance in Dollars July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 Variance in DollarsInterest income$691 $654 $37 $654 $650 $4Interest expense(564) (583) 19 (583) (596) 13Interest income (expense), net$127 $71 $56 $71 $54 $17Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013Interest income increased in fiscal 2014 as compared with fiscal 2013 due to the increase in our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and fixed income investments. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2014 as compared with the prior fiscal year was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of incremental interest rate swaps entered into during fiscal 2014 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. This decrease was partially offset by additional interest expense due to the increase in long-term debt in fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012Interest income increased slightly in fiscal 2013 as compared with prior fiscal year due primarily to increased interest income earned on financing receivables, partially offset by lower interest income from our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and fixed income investments as a result of lower average interest rates. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012 was attributable to the favorable impact of interest rate swaps and lower expense on our floating-rate notes as the benchmark London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) decreased. Other Income (Loss), Net The components of other income (loss), net, are summarized as follows (in millions):Years EndedJuly 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 Variance in Dollars July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012 Variance in DollarsGains (losses) on investments, net: Publicly traded equity securities$253 $17 $236 $17 $43 $(26)Fixed income securities47 31 16 31 58 (27)Total available-for-sale investments300 48 252 48 101 (53)Privately held companies(60) (57) (3) (57) (70) 13Net gains (losses) on investments240 (9) 249 (9) 31 (40)Other gains (losses), net3 (31) 34 (31) 9 (40)Other income (loss), net$243 $(40) $283 $(40) $40 $(80)Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013The increase in total net gains on available-for-sale investments in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily attributable to higher gains on publicly traded equity securities in the current period as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities. The change in net losses on investments in privately held companies for the fiscal 2014 as compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to an increase of $40 million in our proportional share of losses from our VCE joint venture, partially offset by higher realized gains from various investments in privately held companies. The change in other gains (losses), net in fiscal 2014 as compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to higher gains on equity derivative instruments and lower donation expenses, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts in fiscal 2014.Fiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012The decrease in net gains on available-for-sale investments in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 was attributable to lower gains on fixed income and publicly traded equity securities in fiscal 2013 as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities. For fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012, the change in net losses on investments in privately held companies was primarily due to higher realized gains from various private investments, partially offset by an increase of $23 million in our proportional share of losses from our VCE joint venture. The change in other gains (losses), net for fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012, was primarily due to an increase in donations and less favorable foreign exchange impacts in fiscal 2013. 58Table of ContentsProvision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates, higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates, and expiration of or lapses in tax incentives. Our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries. If these earnings were distributed from the foreign subsidiaries to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes.Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 19.2% for fiscal 2014, compared with 11.1% for fiscal 2013. The net 8.1 percentage point increase in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was primarily attributable to a non-recurring net tax benefit of $794 million, or 7.1 percentage points, due to a tax settlement with the IRS in fiscal 2013.For a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Fiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 11.1% for fiscal 2013, compared with 20.8% for fiscal 2012. The net 9.7 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was primarily attributable to a net tax benefit of $794 million, or 7.1 percentage points, due to a tax settlement with the IRS and an increase in tax benefits of $144 million, or 1.2 percentage points, due to the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit in fiscal 2013.59Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowsCash and Cash Equivalents and Investments The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments (in millions): July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 Increase (Decrease)Cash and cash equivalents$6,726 $7,925 $(1,199)Fixed income securities43,396 39,888 3,508Publicly traded equity securities1,952 2,797 (845)Total$52,074 $50,610 $1,464The net increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014 was primarily the result of cash provided by operating activities of $12.3 billion, a net increase in debt of $4.7 billion and the issuance of common stock of $1.9 billion pursuant to employee stock incentive and purchase plans. These sources of cash were partially offset by the repurchase of common stock of $9.4 billion under the stock repurchase program, cash dividends paid of $3.8 billion, net cash paid for acquisitions of $3.0 billion, and capital expenditures of $1.3 billion. Our total in cash and cash equivalents and investments held by various foreign subsidiaries was $47.4 billion and $40.4 billion as of July 26, 2014 and July 27, 2013, respectively. Under current tax laws and regulations, if these assets were to be distributed from the foreign subsidiaries to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. The balance of cash and cash equivalents and investments available in the United States as of July 26, 2014 and July 27, 2013 was $4.7 billion and $10.2 billion, respectively. We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our fixed income investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below.Free Cash Flow and Capital Allocation As part of our capital allocation strategy, we intend to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment. The following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions):Years EndedJuly 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 July 28, 2012Net cash provided by operating activities$12,332 $12,894 $11,491Acquisition of property and equipment(1,275) (1,160) (1,126)Free cash flow$11,057 $11,734 $10,365We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue, excess tax benefits resulting from share-based compensation, and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. For additional discussion, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report.We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, we have other 60Table of Contentsrequired uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net income provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do. The following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases (in millions, except per-share amounts): DIVIDENDS STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM TOTALYears Ended Per Share Amount Shares Weighted-Average Price per Share Amount AmountJuly 26, 2014 $0.72 $3,758 420 $22.71 $9,539 $13,297July 27, 2013 $0.62 $3,310 128 $21.63 $2,773 $6,083July 28, 2012 $0.28 $1,501 262 $16.64 $4,360 $5,861On August 26, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per common share to be paid on October 22, 2014 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 2, 2014. Any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. Accounts Receivable, Net The following table summarizes our accounts receivable, net (in millions), and DSO: July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 Increase (Decrease)Accounts receivable, net$5,157 $5,470 $(313)DSO38 40 (2)Our accounts receivable net, as of July 26, 2014 decreased by approximately 6% compared with the end of fiscal 2013. Our DSO as of July 26, 2014 was lower by 2 days compared with the end of fiscal 2013, primarily due to an improvement in the linearity of shipments.Inventory Supply Chain The following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in millions, except annualized inventory turns): July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 Increase (Decrease)Inventories$1,591 $1,476 $115Annualized inventory turns12.7 13.8 (1.1)Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers$4,169 $4,033 $136Inventory as of July 26, 2014 increased by 8% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2013, and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by approximately 3%. On a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by 5% compared with the end of fiscal 2013. We believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts.Our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods. Distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers. Manufactured finished goods consist primarily of build-to-order and build-to-stock products.We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity.Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels.61Table of ContentsFinancing Receivables and Guarantees We measure our net balance sheet exposure position related to our financing receivables and financing guarantees by reducing the total of gross financing receivables and financing guarantees by the associated allowances for credit loss and deferred revenue. As of July 26, 2014, our net balance sheet exposure position related to financing receivables and financing guarantees was as follows (in millions): FINANCING RECEIVABLES FINANCING GUARANTEES July 26, 2014LeaseReceivables LoanReceivables Financed ServiceContracts and Other Total Channel Partner End-User Customers Total TOTALFinancing receivables less unearned income$3,527 $1,683 $3,210 $8,420 $263 $202 $465 $8,885Allowance for credit loss(233) (98) (18) (349) — — — (349)Deferred revenue(23) (5) (1,843) (1,871) (127) (166) (293) (2,164)Net balance sheet exposure$3,271 $1,580 $1,349 $6,200 $136 $36 $172 $6,372Financing Receivables Financing receivables less unearned income increased by 2% compared with the end of fiscal 2013. The change was primarily due to a 2% increase in both loan receivables and financed service contracts and other, and also due to 1% increase in lease receivables. We provide financing to certain end-user customers and channel partners to enable sales of our products, services, and networking solutions. These financing arrangements include leases, financed service contracts, and loans. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases. We also provide certain qualified customers financing for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services and advanced services. Our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term.Financing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. Deferred Revenue Related to Financing Receivables and Guarantees The majority of the deferred revenue in the preceding table is related to financed service contracts. The majority of the revenue related to financed service contracts, which primarily relates to technical support services, is deferred as the revenue related to financed service contracts is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed. A portion of the revenue related to lease and loan receivables is also deferred and included in deferred product revenue based on revenue recognition criteria not currently having been met.62Table of ContentsBorrowingsSenior Notes The following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes (in millions): Maturity Date July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 Senior notes: Floating-rate notes: Three-month LIBOR plus 0.25%March 14, 2014 $— $1,250 Three-month LIBOR plus 0.05%September 3, 2015(1)850 — Three-month LIBOR plus 0.28%March 3, 2017(1)1,000 — Three-month LIBOR plus 0.50%March 1, 2019(1)500 — Fixed-rate notes: 1.625%March 14, 2014 — 2,000 2.90%November 17, 2014 500 500 5.50%February 22, 2016 3,000 3,000 1.10%March 3, 2017(1)2,400 — 3.15%March 14, 2017 750 750 4.95%February 15, 2019 2,000 2,000 2.125%March 1, 2019(1)1,750 — 4.45%January 15, 2020 2,500 2,500 2.90%March 4, 2021(1)500 — 3.625%March 4, 2024(1)1,000 — 5.90%February 15, 2039 2,000 2,000 5.50%January 15, 2040 2,000 2,000 Total $20,750 $16,000 (1) In March 2014, we issued senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $8.0 billion.We repaid senior floating-rate and fixed-rate notes upon their maturity in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 for an aggregate principal amount of $3.3 billion.Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable quarterly on the floating-rate notes. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of July 26, 2014.Other Debt Other debt as of July 26, 2014 and July 27, 2013 includes secured borrowings associated with customer financing arrangements. As of July 27, 2013, we also had outstanding notes related to our investment in Insieme. The amount of borrowings outstanding under these arrangements was $12 million and $31 million as of July 26, 2014 and July 27, 2013, respectively.Commercial Paper In fiscal 2011, we established a short-term debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper notes. We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. In fiscal 2014, we issued and repaid $1.0 billion of indebtedness under commercial paper and had no commercial paper notes outstanding as of each of July 26, 2014 and July 27, 2013.Credit Facility On February 17, 2012, we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on February 17, 2017. Any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the higher of the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, Bank of America’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time, or one-month LIBOR plus 1.00% or (ii) LIBOR plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement. As of July 26, 2014, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility.We may also, upon the agreement of either the existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and/or extend the expiration date of the credit facility by up to two additional years, or up to February 17, 2019. 63Table of ContentsDeferred Revenue The following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue (in millions): July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 Increase (Decrease)Service$9,640 $9,403 $237Product4,502 4,020 482 Total$14,142 $13,423 $719Reported as: Current$9,478 $9,262 $216Noncurrent4,664 4,161 503 Total$14,142 $13,423 $719The increase in deferred service revenue in fiscal 2014 reflects the impact of new contract initiations and renewals, partially offset by an increase in customers paying technical support service contracts over time and the impact of ongoing amortization of deferred service revenue. The increase in deferred product revenue was primarily due to increased deferrals related to subscription revenue arrangements and to a lesser extent, due to an increase in shipments not having met revenue recognition criteria as of July 26, 2014.Contractual ObligationsThe impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. In addition, we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at July 26, 2014 (in millions): PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIODJuly 26, 2014Total Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 YearsOperating leases$1,239 $399 $457 $196 $187Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers4,169 4,169 — — —Other purchase obligations896 534 316 45 1Long-term debt20,754 500 8,004 4,250 8,000Other long-term liabilities1,379 — 505 55 819Total by period$28,437 $5,602 $9,282 $4,546 $9,007Other long-term liabilities (uncertainty in the timing of future payments)2,220 Total$30,657 Operating Leases For more information on our operating leases, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. A significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in “Inventory Supply Chain.” As of July 26, 2014, the liability for these purchase commitments was $162 million and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table.Other Purchase Obligations Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations. Long-Term Debt The amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.64Table of ContentsOther Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, noncurrent deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $1,851 million and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of $369 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).Other CommitmentsIn connection with our business combinations and asset purchases, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Insieme Networks, Inc. In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we made an investment in Insieme, an early stage company focused on research and development in the data center market. As set forth in the agreement between Cisco and Insieme, this investment included $100 million of funding and a license to certain of our technology. Immediately prior to the call option exercise and acquisition described below, we owned approximately 83% of Insieme as a result of these investments and have consolidated the results of Insieme in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with this investment, we entered into a put/call option agreement that provided us with the right to purchase the remaining interests in Insieme. In addition, the noncontrolling interest holders could require us to purchase their shares upon the occurrence of certain events. During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we exercised our call option and entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining interests in Insieme. The acquisition closed in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, at which time the former noncontrolling interest holders became eligible to receive up to two milestone payments, which will be determined using agreed-upon formulas based primarily on revenue for certain of Insieme’s products. During fiscal 2014, we recorded compensation expense of $416 million, related to the fair value of the vested portion of amounts that are expected to be earned by the former noncontrolling interest holders. Continued vesting and changes to the fair value of the amounts probable of being earned will result in adjustments to the recorded compensation expense in future periods. Based on the terms of the agreement, we have determined that the maximum amount that could be recorded as compensation expense by us is approximately $855 million, net of forfeitures and including the $416 million that has been expensed during fiscal 2014. The milestone payments, if earned, are expected to be paid primarily during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017.Other Funding Commitments We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $255 million as of July 26, 2014, compared with $263 million as of July 27, 2013.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements. In the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers. These privately held companies and customers may be considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings, and we have determined that as of July 26, 2014 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities.VCE is a joint venture that we formed in fiscal 2010 with EMC Corporation (“EMC”), with investments from VMware, Inc. (“VMware”) and Intel Corporation. VCE helps organizations leverage best-in-class technologies and disciplines from Cisco, EMC, and VMware to enable the transformation to cloud computing. As of July 26, 2014, our cumulative gross investment in VCE was approximately $716 million, inclusive of accrued interest, and our ownership percentage was approximately 35%. During fiscal 2014, we invested approximately $185 million in VCE. We account for our investment in VCE under the equity method, and our portion of VCE’s net loss is recognized in other income (loss), net. As of July 26, 2014, we have recorded cumulative losses from VCE of $644 million since inception. Our carrying value in VCE as of July 26, 2014 was $72 million. Over the next 12 months, as VCE scales its operations, we may make additional investments in VCE and may incur additional losses proportionate with our share ownership.From time to time, EMC and Cisco may enter into guarantee agreements on behalf of VCE to indemnify third parties, such as customers, for monetary damages. Such guarantees were not material as of July 26, 2014.On an ongoing basis, we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.65Table of ContentsWe provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing Receivables and Guarantees.”Securities LendingWe periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale investments. These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. The average daily balance of securities lending for fiscal 2014 and 2013 was $1.5 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. As of July 26, 2014 and July 27, 2013, we had no outstanding securities lending transactions. We believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements. Liquidity and Capital Resource RequirementsBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources. 66Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskOur financial position is exposed to a variety of risks, including interest rate risk, equity price risk, and foreign currency exchange risk.Interest Rate RiskFixed Income Securities We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk. At any time, a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates, including the impact from lower credit spreads, could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives. We had no outstanding hedging instruments for our fixed income securities as of July 26, 2014. Our fixed income investments are held for purposes other than trading. Our fixed income investments are not leveraged as of July 26, 2014. We monitor our interest rate and credit risks, including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers. As of July 26, 2014, approximately 76% of our fixed income securities balance consisted of U.S. government and U.S. government agency securities. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong.The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our fixed income securities, including the hedging effects when applicable, as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates. The market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (“BPS”), plus 100 BPS, and plus 150 BPS. Due to the low interest rate environment at the end of each of fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, we did not believe a parallel shift of minus 100 BPS or minus 150 BPS was relevant. The hypothetical fair values as of July 26, 2014 and July 27, 2013 are as follows (in millions): VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTS FAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 26, 2014 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPSFixed income securitiesN/A N/A $43,721 $43,396 $43,071 $42,747 $42,422 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTS FAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 27, 2013 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPSFixed income securitiesN/A N/A $40,193 $39,888 $39,583 $39,278 $38,973Financing Receivables As of July 26, 2014, our financing receivables had a carrying value of $8.1 billion, compared with $7.9 billion as of July 27, 2013. As of July 26, 2014, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.1 billion, respectively. Debt As of July 26, 2014, we had $20.8 billion in principal amount of senior notes outstanding, which consisted of $2.4 billion floating-rate notes and $18.4 billion fixed-rate notes. The carrying amount of the senior notes was $20.9 billion, and the related fair value based on market prices was $22.4 billion. As of July 26, 2014, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed-rate debt, excluding the $10.4 billion of hedged debt, by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.4 billion, respectively. However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed-rate debt that is not hedged.67Table of ContentsEquity Price RiskThe fair value of our equity investments in publicly traded companies is subject to market price volatility. We may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio. Our equity portfolio consists of securities with characteristics that most closely match the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index or NASDAQ Composite Index. These equity securities are held for purposes other than trading. To manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain equity securities, we may enter into equity derivatives designated as hedging instruments.Publicly Traded Equity Securities The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of publicly traded equity securities as a result of selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each equity security in the portfolio, excluding hedged equity securities, if any. Potential fluctuations in the price of each equity security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 20%, and 30% were selected based on potential near-term changes in those security prices. The hypothetical fair values as of July 26, 2014 and July 27, 2013 are as follows (in millions): VALUATION OFSECURITIESGIVEN AN X%DECREASE INEACH STOCK’S PRICE FAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 26, 2014 VALUATION OFSECURITIESGIVEN AN X%INCREASE INEACH STOCK’S PRICE (30)% (20)% (10)% 10% 20% 30%Publicly traded equity securities$1,144 $1,307 $1,471 $1,634 $1,797 $1,961 $2,124 VALUATION OFSECURITIESGIVEN AN X%DECREASE INEACH STOCK’S PRICE FAIR VALUE AS OF JULY 27, 2013 VALUATION OFSECURITIESGIVEN AN X%INCREASE INEACH STOCK’S PRICE (30)% (20)% (10)% 10% 20% 30%Publicly traded equity securities$1,000 $1,143 $1,286 $1,429 $1,572 $1,715 $1,858Investments in Privately Held Companies We have also invested in privately held companies. These investments are recorded in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are accounted for using primarily either the cost or the equity method. As of July 26, 2014, the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was $899 million, compared with $833 million at July 27, 2013. Some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including, among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return. 68Table of ContentsForeign Currency Exchange RiskOur foreign exchange forward and option contracts outstanding at fiscal year-end are summarized in U.S. dollar equivalents as follows (in millions): July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair ValueForward contracts: Purchased$2,635 $(3) $3,472 $7Sold$896 $2 $1,401 $(5)Option contracts: Purchased$494 $5 $716 $23Sold$466 $(2) $696 $(4)We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our sales are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations.Approximately 65% of our operating expenses are U.S.-dollar denominated. In fiscal 2014, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased our combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by $153 million, or approximately 0.9%, compared with fiscal 2013.In fiscal 2013, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased our combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by $227 million, or approximately 1.3% as compared with fiscal 2012. To reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by non-U.S.-dollar denominated operating expenses and costs, we hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts. These hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons. In designing a specific hedging approach, we consider several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of exposures, costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument, and potential effectiveness of the hedge. The gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales.We also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities. The market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables, investments, and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances. Our forward and option contracts generally have the following maturities: MaturitiesForward and option contracts—forecasted transactions related to operating expenses and service cost of sales Up to 18 monthsForward contracts—current assets and liabilities Up to 3 monthsForward contracts—net investments in foreign subsidiaries Up to 6 monthsForward contracts—long-term customer financings Up to 2 yearsWe do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for trading purposes.69Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:09:30.455026

Over the last 30 plus years, we have been the world’s leader in connecting people, things and technologies - to each other and to the Internet - realizing our vision of changing the way the world works, lives, plays and learns. Today, we have over 70,000 employees in over 400 offices worldwide who design, produce, sell, and deliver integrated products, services, and solutions. Over time, we have expanded to new markets that are a natural extension of our core networking business, as the network has become the platform for automating, orchestrating, integrating, and delivering an ever-increasing array of information technology (IT)–based products and services. A summary of our results is as follows (in millions, except percentages and per-share amounts): Three Months Ended Years Ended July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 Variance July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 Variance Revenue$12,843 $12,357 3.9 % $49,161 $47,142 4.3 % Gross margin percentage60.2% 59.9% 0.3pts60.4% 58.9% 1.5ptsResearch and development$1,548 $1,593 (2.8)% $6,207 $6,294 (1.4)% Sales and marketing$2,549 $2,473 3.1 % $9,821 $9,503 3.3 % General and administrative$536 $508 5.5 % $2,040 $1,934 5.5 % Total R&D, sales and marketing, general and administrative$4,633 $4,574 1.3 % $18,068 $17,731 1.9 % Total as a percentage of revenue36.1% 37.0% (0.9)pts36.8% 37.6% (0.8)pts Amortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses$146 $68 114.7 % $359 $275 30.5 % Restructuring and other charges$73 $82 (11.0)% $484 $418 15.8 % Operating income as a percentage of revenue22.4% 21.7% 0.7pts21.9% 19.8% 2.1ptsIncome tax percentage20.9% 19.1% 1.8pts19.8% 19.2% 0.6ptsNet income$2,319 $2,247 3.2 % $8,981 $7,853 14.4 % Net income as a percentage of revenue18.1% 18.2% (0.1)pts18.3% 16.7% 1.6ptsEarnings per share—diluted$0.45 $0.43 4.7 % $1.75 $1.49 17.4 % 36Table of ContentsFiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014—Financial PerformanceTotal revenue increased by 4% as compared with fiscal 2014, with product and service revenue each increasing by 4%. Total gross margin increased by 1.5 percentage points, as we experienced stable gross margins and the absence in fiscal 2015 of a $655 million supplier component remediation charge recorded in fiscal 2014. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, decreased by 0.8 percentage points, primarily as a result of higher acquisition-related compensation expense in fiscal 2014. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 2.1 percentage points. Diluted earnings per share increased by 17% from the prior year, as a result of both a 14% increase in net income and a decrease in diluted share count by 135 million shares. In fiscal 2015, revenue increased by $2.0 billion as compared with fiscal 2014. Revenue from the Americas increased by $1.9 billion, driven in large part by higher product revenue in the United States. EMEA revenue increased $0.3 billion, led by higher product revenue in the United Kingdom. Revenue in our APJC segment decreased $0.2 billion, led by a product revenue decline in China. We experienced decreased product revenue in the emerging countries of China and Russia and increased revenue in Mexico, India and Brazil, as the “BRICM” countries experienced, in the aggregate, a product revenue decline of 4%. We believe that the product revenue declines we experienced in various emerging countries reflected the impact of economic and geopolitical challenges in those countries. From a customer market standpoint, in fiscal 2015 we experienced solid product revenue growth in the commercial, public sector and enterprise markets, while the service provider market continued to decline. The decline in service provider market was driven by the product revenue decline in our Service Provider Video category.From a product category perspective, the product revenue increase of 4% year-over-year was driven in part by product revenue growth in our core Switching and NGN Routing products which grew 5% and 1%, respectively. We also experienced an increase in revenue from Data Center and Security products which grew 22% and 12%, respectively. Our other major product categories experienced revenue growth with the exception of Service Provider Video which decreased by 10%. Our deferred product revenue grew 21% year-over-year driven by subscription and software revenue arrangements, with strength in Collaboration, Security and Wireless. Service revenue increased by 4% year over year. In summary, during fiscal 2015, we achieved solid and profitable revenue growth despite encountering challenges similar to those we experienced during fiscal 2014 in the service provider market and certain emerging countries.37Table of ContentsFourth Quarter SnapshotFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2014, total revenue grew 4%, as product and service revenue each increased by 4%. With regard to our geographic segment performance, on a year-over-year basis revenue in the Americas increased by 7%, while EMEA and APJC were both flat. From a product category perspective, product revenue growth was driven by growth from Collaboration and Data Center products, as each grew 14% year over year. Total gross margin increased by 0.3 percentage points. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively decreased by 0.9 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 0.7 percentage points. Diluted earnings per share increased by 5% from the prior year, primarily as a result of both a 3% increase in net income and a decrease in our diluted share count by 41 million shares.Strategy and Focus AreasWe see our customers, in every industry, increasingly using technology—and, specifically, the network—to grow their business, drive efficiencies, and try to gain a competitive advantage. In this increasingly digital world, data is the most strategic asset and is increasingly distributed across every organization and ecosystem—on customer premises, at the edge of the network, and in the cloud. The network also plays an increasingly important role enabling our customers to aggregate, automate, and draw insights from this highly distributed data where there is a premium on security and speed. This is driving them to adopt entirely new IT architectures and organizational structures. We understand how technology can deliver the outcomes our customers want to achieve, and our strategy is to lead our customers in their digital transition with solutions including pervasive, industry-leading security that intelligently connect nearly everything that can be connected.To deliver on our strategy, we are focused on providing highly secure, automated and intelligent solutions built on infrastructure that connects data that is highly distributed (globally dispersed across organizations). Together with our ecosystem of partners and developers, we aim to provide the technology, services, and solutions that we believe will enable our customers to gain insight and advantage from this distributed data with scale, security and agility. For a full discussion of our strategy and focus areas, see Item 1. Business.Other Key Financial MeasuresThe following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 (in millions, except days sales outstanding in accounts receivable (DSO) and annualized inventory turns): Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2014Cash and cash equivalents and investments $60,416 $52,074Cash provided by operating activities $12,552 $12,332Deferred revenue $15,183 $14,142Repurchases of common stock—stock repurchase program $4,234 $9,539Dividends $4,086 $3,758DSO 38 days 38 daysInventories $1,627 $1,591Annualized inventory turns 12.1 12.7Our product backlog at the end of fiscal 2015 was $5.1 billion, or 10% of fiscal 2015 total revenue, compared with $5.4 billion at the end of fiscal 2014, or 12% of fiscal 2014 total revenue.38Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met:•Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Contracts, Internet commerce agreements, and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.•Delivery has occurred. Shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery.•The fee is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.•Collectibility is reasonably assured. We assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer’s payment history.In instances where final acceptance of the product, system, or solution is specified by the customer, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. When a sale involves multiple deliverables, such as sales of products that include services, the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting, and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price. Revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met. For hosting arrangements, we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the subscription period, while usage revenue is recognized based on utilization. Software subscription revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription term upon delivery of the first product and commencement of the term. The amount of product and service revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and, if so, our valuation of the units of accounting for multiple deliverables. According to the accounting guidance prescribed in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605, Revenue Recognition, we use vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE) for each of those units, when available. We determine VSOE based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the historical standalone transactions have the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range, generally evidenced by approximately 80% of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus 15% of the median rates. When VSOE does not exist, we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multiple-deliverable arrangements. Under the selling price hierarchy, third-party evidence of selling price (TPE) will be considered if VSOE does not exist, and estimated selling price (ESP) will be used if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Generally, we are not able to determine TPE because our go-to-market strategy differs from that of others in our markets, and the extent of our proprietary technology varies among comparable products or services from those of our peers. In determining ESP, we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors, based on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement. We typically arrive at an ESP for a product or service that is not sold separately by considering company-specific factors such as geographies, competitive landscape, internal costs, profitability objectives, pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing, and existing portfolio pricing and discounting. Some of our sales arrangements have multiple deliverables containing software and related software support components. Such sales arrangements are subject to the accounting guidance in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition.As our business and offerings evolve over time, our pricing practices may be required to be modified accordingly, which could result in changes in selling prices, including both VSOE and ESP, in subsequent periods. There were no material impacts during fiscal 2015, nor do we currently expect a material impact in the next 12 months on our revenue recognition due to any changes in our VSOE, TPE, or ESP. Revenue deferrals relate to the timing of revenue recognition for specific transactions based on financing arrangements, service, support, and other factors. Financing arrangements may include sales-type, direct-financing, and operating leases, loans, and guarantees of third-party financing. Our deferred revenue for products was $5.4 billion and $4.5 billion as of July 25, 2015 and July 26, 2014, respectively. Technical support services revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed, which typically is from one to three years. Advanced services revenue is recognized upon delivery or completion of performance milestones. Our deferred revenue for services was $9.8 billion and $9.6 billion as of July 25, 2015 and July 26, 2014, respectively.39Table of ContentsWe make sales to distributors which we refer to as two-tier systems of sales to the end customer. Revenue from distributors is recognized based on a sell-through method using information provided by them. Our distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs. If actual credits received by our distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.Allowances for Receivables and Sales ReturnsThe allowances for receivables were as follows (in millions, except percentages): July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014Allowance for doubtful accounts $302 $265Percentage of gross accounts receivable 5.4% 4.9%Allowance for credit loss—lease receivables $259 $233Percentage of gross lease receivables (1) 7.2% 6.2%Allowance for credit loss—loan receivables $87 $98Percentage of gross loan receivables 4.9% 5.8%(1) Calculated as allowance for credit loss on lease receivables as a percentage of gross lease receivables and residual value before unearned income.The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience, credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay and expected default frequency rates, which are published by major third-party credit-rating agencies and are generally updated on a quarterly basis. We also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts. If a major customer’s creditworthiness deteriorates, if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, or if other circumstances arise, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, and additional allowances could be required, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.The allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis. When evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis, we consider historical experience, credit quality and age of receivable balances, and economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. When evaluating financing receivables on a collective basis, we use expected default frequency rates published by a major third-party credit-rating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default, while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions, concentration of risk and correlation. Determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings, as well as assessing factors such as economic conditions, concentration of risk, and correlation, are complex and subjective. Our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results. Both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible.A reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. The reserve for future sales returns as of July 25, 2015 and July 26, 2014 was $129 million and $135 million, respectively, and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable. If the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established, our revenue could be adversely affected. Inventory Valuation and Liability for Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and SuppliersOur inventory balance was $1.6 billion as of each July 25, 2015 and July 26, 2014. Inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories, determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of our cost of sales. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. As of July 25, 2015, the liability for these purchase commitments was $156 million, compared with $162 million as of July 26, 2014, and was included in other current liabilities.40Table of ContentsOur provision for inventory was $54 million, $67 million, and $114 million in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was $102 million, $124 million, and $106 million in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we could be required to increase our inventory write-downs, and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and accordingly our profitability, could be adversely affected. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments. Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence, particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainties and conditions and the resulting potential for changes in future demand forecast. Loss Contingencies and Product WarrantiesWe are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.We have recorded a liability for the expected remediation cost for certain products sold in prior fiscal years containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010. In February 2014, on the basis of the growing number of failures as described in Note 12 (f) to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we decided to expand our approach, which resulted in a charge to product cost of sales of $655 million being recorded for the second quarter of fiscal 2014. During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded an adjustment to product cost of sales of $164 million to reduce the liability, reflecting net lower than previously estimated future costs to remediate the impacted customer products. Estimating this liability is complex and subjective, and if we experience changes in a number of underlying assumptions and estimates such as a change in claims compared with our expectations, or if the cost of servicing these claims is different than expected, our estimated liability may be impacted.Our liability for product warranties, included in other current liabilities, was $449 million as of July 25, 2015, compared with $446 million as of July 26, 2014. Our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years, and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty. We accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs, technical support labor costs, and associated overhead. Material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment. Technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period. Overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities.The provision for product warranties during fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $696 million, $704 million, and $649 million, respectively. If we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected, our profitability could be adversely affected.Fair Value MeasurementsOur fixed income and publicly traded equity securities, collectively, are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at a fair value of $53.5 billion as of July 25, 2015, compared with $45.3 billion as of July 26, 2014. Our fixed income investment portfolio, as of July 25, 2015, consisted primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.As described more fully in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a valuation hierarchy is based on the level of independent, objective evidence available regarding the value of the investments. It encompasses three classes of investments: Level 1 consists of securities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical securities; Level 2 consists of securities for which observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs are used, such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets and model-derived valuations for which the variables are derived from, or corroborated by, observable market data; and Level 3 consists of securities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value.41Table of ContentsOur Level 2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. We use inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from independent pricing vendors, quoted market prices, or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities. We use such pricing data as the primary input, to which we have not made any material adjustments during fiscal 2015 and 2014, to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio. We are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates.The inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness, may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information, and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to its estimate of fair value. The assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective. However, given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio, and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets, we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of subjectivity and judgment was material to the valuation of the investment portfolio as of July 25, 2015. Level 3 assets do not represent a significant portion of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of July 25, 2015 and July 26, 2014.Other-than-Temporary Impairments We recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary. The ultimate value realized on these securities, to the extent unhedged, is subject to market price volatility until they are sold.If the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary. An impairment is considered other than temporary if (i) we have the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on (i) or (ii) described in the prior sentence, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (iii), the amount representing credit loss, defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security, will be recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). In estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected, we consider all available information, including past events, current conditions, the remaining payment terms of the security, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults, and the value of underlying collateral.For publicly traded equity securities, we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.There were no impairment charges on our investments in publicly traded equity securities in fiscal 2015 and 2013, and we recognized $11 million of such impairment charges in earnings for fiscal 2014. There were no impairment charges on our investments in fixed income securities in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income.We also have investments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages. As of July 25, 2015, our investments in privately held companies were $897 million, compared with $899 million as of July 26, 2014, and were included in other assets. We monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment, and we make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required, based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. Our impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were $41 million, $23 million, and $33 million in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Asset ImpairmentsOur methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.42Table of ContentsThe goodwill recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 25, 2015 and July 26, 2014 was $24.5 billion and $24.2 billion, respectively. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill resulting from our annual impairment testing in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013. For the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2015, the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was $40.8 billion for the Americas, $32.6 billion for EMEA, and $12.9 billion for APJC. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were $175 million during fiscal 2015. There were no impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets during fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R&D tax credits, domestic manufacturing deductions, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, international realignments, and transfer pricing adjustments. Our effective tax rate was 19.8%, 19.2%, and 11.1% in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by expiration of or lapses in the R&D tax credit or domestic manufacturing deduction laws; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany R&D cost-sharing arrangement and legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including possible changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 34 countries, including the United States, is contemplating changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. These contemplated changes, if finalized and adopted by countries, will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. As a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. 43Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSRevenueThe following table presents the breakdown of revenue between product and service (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentRevenue: Product $37,750 $36,172 $38,029 $1,578 4.4% $(1,857) (4.9)%Percentage of revenue 76.8% 76.7% 78.2% Service 11,411 10,970 10,578 441 4.0% 392 3.7 %Percentage of revenue 23.2% 23.3% 21.8% Total $49,161 $47,142 $48,607 $2,019 4.3% $(1,465) (3.0)%We manage our business primarily on a geographic basis, organized into three geographic segments. Our revenue, which includes product and service for each segment, is summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentRevenue: Americas $29,655 $27,781 $28,639 $1,874 6.7 % $(858) (3.0)%Percentage of revenue 60.3% 58.9% 58.9% EMEA 12,322 12,006 12,210 316 2.6 % (204) (1.7)%Percentage of revenue 25.1% 25.5% 25.1% APJC 7,184 7,355 7,758 (171) (2.3)% (403) (5.2)%Percentage of revenue 14.6% 15.6% 16.0% Total $49,161 $47,142 $48,607 $2,019 4.3 % $(1,465) (3.0)%Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014 For fiscal 2015, as compared with fiscal 2014, total revenue increased by 4%, as product and service revenue each increased by 4%. Our total revenue grew in our Americas and EMEA geographic segments, while revenue declined in the APJC segment. The emerging countries of BRICM, in the aggregate, experienced a 4% product revenue decline, with declines in China and Russia partially offset by increases in the other three BRICM countries.We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, as was the case during fiscal 2015, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations. Our revenue in fiscal 2015, and in particular our revenue for EMEA and APJC, was adversely affected by the depreciation of certain currencies relative to the U.S. dollar especially in certain emerging countries, although the indirect effects are difficult to measure.In addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced IT spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple-element arrangements; the mix of financing arrangements provided to our channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment. As has been the case in certain of our emerging countries from time to time, customers require greater levels of financing arrangements, service, and support, and these activities may occur in future periods, which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue.44Table of ContentsFiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013 For fiscal 2014, as compared with fiscal 2013, total revenue decreased by 3%. Product revenue decreased by 5%, while service revenue increased by 4%. The decrease in product revenue reflected declines across all geographic segments as well as across all customer markets. Service revenues experienced slower growth in our Americas and APJC geographic segments while we experienced slightly faster growth in the EMEA segment. Product Revenue by SegmentThe following table presents the breakdown of product revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentProduct revenue: Americas $22,261 $20,631 $21,653 $1,630 7.9 % $(1,022) (4.7)%Percentage of product revenue 59.0% 57.0% 57.0% EMEA 9,856 9,655 10,049 201 2.1 % (394) (3.9)%Percentage of product revenue 26.1% 26.7% 26.4% APJC 5,633 5,886 6,327 (253) (4.3)% (441) (7.0)%Percentage of product revenue 14.9% 16.3% 16.6% Total $37,750 $36,172 $38,029 $1,578 4.4 % $(1,857) (4.9)%AmericasFiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014The increase in product revenue in the Americas segment of 8% was led by solid growth in the public sector, commercial and enterprise markets. The product revenue growth in the public sector market was due primarily to higher sales to the U.S. federal government and, to a lesser extent, higher sales to state and local governments. The product revenue growth in the enterprise and commercial markets was driven by strength in the United States. We experienced a product revenue decline in the service provider market in this segment. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 8% in the United States, 34% in Mexico, and 2% in Brazil. Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013Product revenue in the Americas segment decreased by 5%, led by a significant decline in the service provider market and, to a lesser extent, declines in the public sector and commercial markets. Product revenue declined in the U.S. public sector market, led by lower sales to the U.S. federal government. From a country perspective, product revenue decreased by 5% in the United States, 10% in Canada, and 13% in Brazil, partially offset by an increase of 2% in Mexico. EMEAFiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014Product revenue in the EMEA segment increased by 2%, driven by growth in the commercial, public sector and enterprise markets. Product revenue in the service provider market was flat. Product revenue from emerging countries within EMEA increased by 1% and product revenue for the remainder of EMEA grew by 2%. Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013Product revenue in the EMEA segment decreased by 4%, led by a decline in the service provider market and, to a lesser extent, declines in the enterprise and public sector markets. Product revenue from emerging countries within EMEA decreased by 11%, led by a 24% decrease in Russia. Product revenue for the remainder of EMEA, which is primarily composed of countries in western Europe, declined by 2%.45Table of ContentsAPJCFiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014The decrease in product revenue in the APJC segment of 4% was led by a significant decline in the service provider market and, to a lesser degree, in the public sector and enterprise markets. These decreases were partially offset by growth in the commercial market. From a country perspective, product revenue decreased by 21% in China and 5% in Japan. We experienced product revenue growth of 15% in India and 8% in Australia. Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013Product revenue in the APJC segment decreased by 7%, led by declines in the service provider and enterprise markets and, to a lesser extent, a decline in the commercial market. We continued to experience declines in many of the emerging countries within this segment, most notably in India which experienced a year-over-year product revenue decline of 15%. Other countries that contributed to the weakness in this segment included Japan, Australia, and China, which experienced year-over-year product revenue declines of 11%, 7%, and 6%, respectively. 46Table of ContentsProduct Revenue by Groups of Similar ProductsIn addition to the primary view on a geographic basis, we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes. Our product categories consist of the following categories (with subcategories in parentheses): Switching (fixed switching, modular switching, and storage); NGN Routing (high-end routers, mid-range and low-end routers, and other NGN Routing products); Collaboration (unified communications, Cisco TelePresence, and conferencing); Service Provider Video (infrastructure, video software, and solutions and cable access); Data Center; Wireless; Security; and Other Products.

SwitchingFiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014The increase in revenue in our Switching product category of 5%, or $740 million, was driven by a 9%, or $826 million, increase in revenue from our LAN fixed-configuration switches and, to a lesser extent, a 24%, or $102 million, increase in sales of storage products. Revenue from LAN fixed-configuration switches increased due to higher sales of most of our Cisco Nexus Series Switches and Cisco Catalyst Series Switches within this category. We experienced a decrease in revenue from our modular switches of 4%, or $188 million, driven by lower sales of Cisco Catalyst 6500-E Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches. Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013Revenue in our Switching product category decreased by 5%, or $710 million driven by a 12%, or $656 million, decrease in revenue from our modular switches. Revenue from our modular switches decreased due to lower sales of Cisco Catalyst 6000 Series Switches. We also experienced a 3% decrease in sales of storage products within this category. Revenue from our LAN fixed-configuration switches was relatively flat year over year, as lower sales of most of our fixed-configuration Cisco Catalyst Series Switches and fixed-configuration Cisco Nexus Series Switches were offset by the continued adoption of Cisco Catalyst 3850 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 6000 Series Switches. 47Table of ContentsNGN RoutingFiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014Revenue in our NGN Routing product category increased by 1%, or $95 million, driven by a 6%, or $248 million, increase in revenue from our high-end router products and a slight increase in revenue from our midrange and low-end router products, partially offset by 28%, or $171 million, decrease in revenue from other NGN Routing products. Revenue from high-end router products increased due to an increase in revenue from most products within our Cisco ASR category and the adoption of our Cisco NCS platform and CRS-X, partially offset by lower sales of our legacy high-end router products. The slight increase in revenue from our midrange and low-end router products was due to higher sales of our Cisco ISR products, partially offset by lower sales of certain of our access products. Revenue from other NGN Routing products decreased primarily due to lower sales of certain optical networking products. Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013The decrease in revenue in our NGN Routing product category of 7%, or $559 million, was driven by a 6%, or $278 million, decrease in revenue from high-end router products; an 8%, or $227 million, decrease in revenue from our midrange and low-end router products; and an 8%, or $54 million, decrease in revenue from other NGN Routing products. Revenue from our high-end products decreased due to lower sales of Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System products and our legacy high-end router products, partially offset by increased sales of our Cisco ASR edge products. The decrease in revenue from our midrange and low-end router products was driven by lower sales of our Cisco ISR products. Revenue from other NGN Routing products decreased due to lower sales of certain optical networking products. CollaborationFiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014Revenue in our Collaboration product category increased by 5%, or $185 million, due to increased revenue from our Unified Communications products as a result of higher software revenue and a slight increase in revenue from phones. Higher revenue from our Cisco TelePresence and conferencing products also contributed to the increase. Revenue from Cisco TelePresence products increased due to higher revenue in endpoint products as a result of new product introductions. The increase in conferencing revenue was a result of higher recurring revenue. We continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our Collaboration product category.Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013We continue to increase the proportion of recurring revenue in our Collaboration product category. Overall, revenue in our Collaboration product category decreased by 6%, or $242 million, primarily due to decreased revenue from our Cisco TelePresence and Unified Communications products, driven by weakness in endpoint products such as phones. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenue from our conferencing products. Service Provider VideoFiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014The decrease in revenue from our Service Provider Video product category of 10%, or $414 million, was driven by a 16%, or $332 million, decrease in sales of our Service Provider Video infrastructure products, due primarily to lower sales of set-top boxes. We also experienced a decrease in revenue from cable access products within this product category. On July 22, 2015, we entered into an exclusive agreement to sell the client premises equipment portion of our Service Provider Video connected devices business unit to French-based Technicolor. We will continue to refocus our investments in Service Provider Video towards cloud, security and software-based services. Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013Revenue in our Service Provider Video product category decreased by 18%, or $886 million, with the largest driver of the decline being a 21%, or $812 million, decrease in sales of our Service Provider Video infrastructure products. The revenue decline in Service Provider Video infrastructure products, which includes connected devices products, was due primarily to lower sales of set-top boxes. 48Table of ContentsData CenterFiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014Revenue in our Data Center product category grew by 22%, or $580 million, with sales growth of our Cisco Unified Computing System products across all geographic segments and customer markets. The increase was due in large part to the continued momentum we are experiencing in both data center and cloud environments, as current customers increase their data center build-outs and as new customers deploy these offerings.To the extent our data center business grows and further penetrates the market, we expect that, in comparison to what we experienced during the initial rapid growth of this business, the growth rates for our data center product sales will experience more normal seasonality consistent with the overall server market. Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013We continue to experience solid growth in our Data Center product category, which grew by 27%, or $566 million, with sales growth of our Cisco Unified Computing System products across all geographic segments and customer markets. The increase was due in large part to the continued momentum we are experiencing in both data center and cloud environments, as current customers increase their data center build-outs and as new customers deploy these offerings.WirelessFiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014Revenue in our Wireless product category increased by 11%, or $249 million, driven by continued growth in sales of Meraki products combined with continued strength in our 802.11ac portfolio. We continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our Wireless product category.Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013We continue to increase the proportion of recurring revenue in our Wireless product category. Revenue in our Wireless product category increased by 2%, or $36 million, due to an increase in sales of Meraki products, which we acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, partially offset by lower sales of other wireless products.SecurityFiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014Revenue in our Security product category was up 12%, or $181 million, driven primarily by sales of Sourcefire products and, to a lesser extent, by higher sales of our high-end firewall products within our network security product portfolio. This increase was partially offset by a slight decrease in revenue from our content security products due to lower sales of web and e-mail security products. We continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our Security product category.Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013We continue to increase the proportion of recurring revenue in our Security product category. Revenue in our Security product category was up 16%, or $218 million, driven primarily by sales of Sourcefire products, which company we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and, to a lesser degree, by both higher sales of our high-end firewall products within our network security product portfolio and slightly higher sales of our content security products. Other ProductsWe experienced a year-over-year decrease in revenue in our Other Products category for fiscal 2015 due in large part to the decrease in sales of our other networking products. The year-over-year decrease in revenue in our Other Products category for fiscal 2014 was due in large part to the sale of our Linksys product line in the third quarter of fiscal 2013.49Table of ContentsService Revenue by SegmentThe following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013Years EndedJuly 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentService revenue: Americas$7,394 $7,150 $6,986 $244 3.4% $164 2.3%Percentage of service revenue64.8% 65.2% 66.1% EMEA2,466 2,351 2,161 115 4.9% 190 8.8%Percentage of service revenue21.6% 21.4% 20.4% APJC1,551 1,469 1,431 82 5.6% 38 2.7%Percentage of service revenue13.6% 13.4% 13.5% Total$11,411 $10,970 $10,578 $441 4.0% $392 3.7%Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014Service revenue increased across all of our geographic segments. Worldwide technical support services revenue increased by 3% and worldwide advanced services revenue increased by 6%, driven by growth in subscription revenues. Technical support services revenue experienced relatively balanced growth across all geographic segments. Renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with product sales provided an installed base of equipment being serviced which, in concert with new service offerings, were the primary factors driving the revenue increases. Advanced services revenue, which relates to consulting support services for specific customer network needs, grew across all geographic segments. Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013Service revenue continued to experience slower growth than in prior fiscal years, with varying levels of growth across our geographic segments. Worldwide technical support services revenue increased by 4% while worldwide advanced services revenue experienced 3% growth. Technical support services revenue experienced growth across all geographic segments. Renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with product sales provided an installed base of equipment being serviced which, in concert with new service offerings, were the primary factors driving the revenue increases. Advanced services revenue, slightly declined in the Americas segment but had solid growth in the EMEA and APJC segments due to growth in subscription revenues. 50Table of ContentsGross MarginThe following table presents the gross margin for products and services (in millions, except percentages): AMOUNT PERCENTAGEYears EndedJuly 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013Gross margin: Product$22,373 $20,531 $22,488 59.3% 56.8% 59.1%Service7,308 7,238 6,952 64.0% 66.0% 65.7%Total$29,681 $27,769 $29,440 60.4% 58.9% 60.6%Product Gross MarginFiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014The following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015: Product Gross Margin PercentageFiscal 2014 56.8 %Productivity (1) 2.8 %Supplier component remediation charge/adjustment 2.2 %Mix of products sold 0.3 %Product pricing (2.3)%Rockstar patent portfolio charge (0.5)%Fiscal 2015 59.3 % (1) Productivity includes overall manufacturing-related costs, such as component costs, warranty expense, provision for inventory, freight, logistics, shipment volume, and other items not categorized elsewhere.Product gross margin increased by 2.5 percentage points compared with fiscal 2014. The increase in product gross margin was due to productivity improvements, which were driven by value engineering efforts; favorable component pricing; continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations and lower warranty expense. Value engineering is the process by which production costs are reduced through component redesign, board configuration, test processes, and transformation processes. The increase was also due to the $655 million charge to product cost of sales in fiscal 2014 related to the expected cost to remediate issues with a supplier component in certain products sold in prior fiscal years and an associated $164 million favorable adjustment recorded in fiscal 2015.Additionally, gross margin increased due to the mix of products sold. The favorable product mix impact was due to revenue decreases from our relatively lower margin Service Provider Video products and a revenue increase from certain of our higher margin core products, partially offset by increased revenue from our relatively lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products. The various factors contributing to the product gross margin increase were partially offset by unfavorable impacts from product pricing, which were driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets, as well as the unfavorable impact of a $188 million charge to product cost of sales recorded in fiscal 2015 related to the Rockstar patent portfolio, see Note 4(b) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our future gross margins could be impacted by our product mix and could be adversely affected by further growth in sales of products that have lower gross margins, such as Cisco Unified Computing System products. Our gross margins may also be impacted by the geographic mix of our revenue and, as was the case in fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, may be adversely affected by product pricing attributable to competitive factors. Additionally, our manufacturing-related costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain, which in turn could negatively affect gross margin. If any of the preceding factors that in the past have negatively impacted our gross margins arise in future periods, our gross margins could continue to decline.51Table of ContentsFiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013The following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014: Product Gross Margin PercentageFiscal 2013 59.1 %Product pricing (3.1)%Supplier component remediation charge (1.8)%Mix of products sold (0.5)%Amortization of purchased intangible assets (0.5)%Productivity (1) 3.0 %TiVo patent litigation settlement 0.5 %Acquisition fair value adjustment to inventory and other 0.1 %Fiscal 2014 56.8 %Product gross margin decreased by 2.3 percentage points compared with fiscal 2013. The decrease in product gross margin was driven by unfavorable impacts from product pricing, which were driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets. The decrease was also due, in part, to the supplier component remediation charge of $655 million to product cost of sales recorded in fiscal 2014 discussed above. In addition, the shift in the mix of products sold decreased our product gross margin, primarily as a result of a revenue increase in our Cisco Unified Computing System products and decreased revenue from our higher margin core products, partially offset by decreased revenue from our Service Provider Video products. Our product gross margin for fiscal 2014 was also negatively impacted by higher amortization expense of purchased intangible assets. For further explanation of the increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets, see “Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets” below. These amounts were partially offset by productivity benefits and the absence of charges related to the TiVo patent litigation settlement which we incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. The productivity benefits we experienced in fiscal 2014 were driven by value engineering efforts; favorable component pricing; and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations. Service Gross MarginFiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014Service gross margin percentage decreased by 2.0 percentage points for fiscal 2015, as compared with fiscal 2014, driven by increased cost impacts such as partner delivery costs, headcount-related costs and outside services. Headcount-related costs increased due to continued investments in security and cloud managed services and higher variable compensation expense. These cost impacts were partially offset by the resulting benefit to gross margin of higher sales volume in both advanced services and technical support services.Our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. Other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services.Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013Our service gross margin percentage increased slightly by 0.3 percentage points for fiscal 2014, as compared with fiscal 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume in both advanced services and technical support services. The benefits to gross margin of increased sales volume were partially offset by increased cost impacts such as outside service costs, partner delivery costs, and headcount-related costs.52Table of ContentsGross Margin by SegmentThe following table presents the total gross margin for each segment (in millions, except percentages): AMOUNT PERCENTAGEYears Ended July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013Gross margin: Americas $18,670 $17,379 $17,887 63.0% 62.6% 62.5%EMEA 7,705 7,700 7,876 62.5% 64.1% 64.5%APJC 4,307 4,252 4,637 60.0% 57.8% 59.8%Segment total 30,682 29,331 30,400 62.4% 62.2% 62.5%Unallocated corporate items (1) (1,001) (1,562) (960) Total $29,681 $27,769 $29,440 60.4% 58.9% 60.6% (1) The unallocated corporate items for the years presented include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant litigation and other contingencies, impacts to cost of sales from purchase accounting adjustments to inventory, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges. We do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments. Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014We experienced a gross margin percentage increase in our Americas segment due to productivity improvements partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing. The product mix was flat in this geographic segment as the impact of decreased revenue from our relatively lower margin Service Provider Video products offset the increase in revenue from our relatively lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products. The gross margin percentage decrease in our EMEA segment was due primarily to unfavorable impacts from pricing and mix. The unfavorable mix impact was driven by an increase in revenue from our relatively lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products. Lower service gross margin also contributed to the decrease in the overall gross margin in this segment.The APJC segment gross margin percentage increased due to productivity improvements and a favorable mix impact, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing. The favorable mix impact was driven by a decrease in revenue from our relatively lower margin Service Provider Video products and an increase in revenue from certain of our higher margin core products. The gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment. Our product and service gross margins may be impacted by economic downturns or uncertain economic conditions as well as our movement into new market opportunities, and could decline if any of the factors that impact our gross margins are adversely affected in future periods. Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013The Americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage increase due to the impact of productivity improvements in this geographic segment. Partially offsetting this favorable impact to gross margin were negative impacts from pricing and an unfavorable mix. The unfavorable mix impact was driven by revenue increases in our Cisco Unified Computing System products and lower sales of our higher margin core products, partially offset by decreased revenue from our Service Provider Video products. The gross margin percentage decrease in our EMEA segment was due primarily to the unfavorable impacts from pricing, as well as an unfavorable mix impact, partially offset by productivity improvements in this geographic segment. The unfavorable mix impact was driven by an increase in revenue from our Cisco Unified Computing System products.Our APJC segment gross margin percentage decreased primarily as a result of unfavorable impacts from pricing, and also as a result of an unfavorable mix. The unfavorable mix impact was driven by an increase in revenue from our Cisco Unified Computing System products. Partially offsetting these factors were impacts from productivity improvements and higher service gross margin in this geographic segment.53Table of ContentsFactors That May Impact Revenue and Gross MarginProduct revenue may continue to be affected by factors, including global economic downturns and related market uncertainty, that have resulted in reduced IT-related capital spending in certain segments within our enterprise, service provider, public sector, and commercial markets; changes in the geopolitical environment and global economic conditions; competition, including price-focused competitors from Asia, especially from China; new product introductions; sales cycles and product implementation cycles; changes in the mix of our customers between service provider and enterprise markets; changes in the mix of direct sales and indirect sales; variations in sales channels; and final acceptance criteria of the product, system, or solution as specified by the customer. Sales to the service provider market have been and may be in the future characterized by large and sporadic purchases, especially relating to our NGN Routing sales and sales of certain products within our Collaboration, Service Provider Video and Data Center product categories. In addition, service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader range of services, including network design services; and often have acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition. Certain of our customers in certain emerging countries also tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may similarly be affected by the timing of revenue recognition. As we focus on new market opportunities, customers may require greater levels of financing arrangements, service, and support, especially in certain emerging countries, which in turn may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition. To improve customer satisfaction, we continue to focus on managing our manufacturing lead-time performance, which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog. A decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quarter-to-quarter revenue and operating results.Product revenue may also be adversely affected by fluctuations in demand for our products, especially with respect to telecommunications service providers and Internet businesses, whether or not driven by any slowdown in capital expenditures in the service provider market; price and product competition in the communications and information technology industry; introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products; adoption of new networking standards; and financial difficulties experienced by our customers. We may, from time to time, experience manufacturing issues that create a delay in our suppliers’ ability to provide specific components, resulting in delayed shipments. To the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in periods when we and our suppliers are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters are not remediated within the same quarter. For additional factors that may impact product revenue, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Our distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs. Increased sales to our distributors generally result in greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and, to a certain degree, the timing of orders from our customers. We recognize revenue for sales to our distributors generally based on a sell-through method using information provided by them, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for all cooperative marketing and other programs.Product gross margin may be adversely affected in the future by changes in the mix of products sold, including periods of increased growth of some of our lower margin products; introduction of new products, including products with price-performance advantages and new business models for our offerings such as XaaS; our ability to reduce production costs; entry into new markets, including markets with different pricing structures and cost structures, as a result of internal development or through acquisitions; changes in distribution channels; price competition, including competitors from Asia, especially those from China; changes in geographic mix of our product revenue; the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals; sales discounts; increases in material or labor costs, including share-based compensation expense; excess inventory and obsolescence charges; warranty costs; changes in shipment volume; loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing; effects of value engineering; inventory holding charges; and the extent to which we successfully execute on our strategy and operating plans. Additionally, our manufacturing-related costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain. Service gross margin may be impacted by various factors such as the change in mix between technical support services and advanced services; the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals; share-based compensation expense; and the timing of our strategic investments in headcount and resources to support this business.54Table of ContentsResearch and Development (“R&D”), Sales and Marketing, and General and Administrative (“G&A”) ExpensesR&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses are summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentResearch and development $6,207 $6,294 $5,942 $(87) (1.4)% $352 5.9 %Percentage of revenue 12.6% 13.4% 12.2% Sales and marketing 9,821 9,503 9,538 318 3.3 % (35) (0.4)%Percentage of revenue 20.0% 20.2% 19.6% General and administrative 2,040 1,934 2,264 106 5.5 % (330) (14.6)%Percentage of revenue 4.1% 4.1% 4.7% Total $18,068 $17,731 $17,744 $337 1.9 % $(13) (0.1)%Percentage of revenue 36.8% 37.6% 36.5% R&D ExpensesFiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014The decrease in R&D expenses for fiscal 2015, as compared with fiscal 2014, was primarily due to higher compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2014 in connection with our acquisition of the remaining interest in Insieme. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Efficiencies arising from our restructuring action announced in August 2014 also contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by higher contracted services and higher share-based compensation expense. We continue to invest in R&D in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. If we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal R&D.Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013R&D expenses increased for fiscal 2014, as compared with fiscal 2013, primarily due to compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2014 in connection with our acquisition of the remaining interest in Insieme. Higher share-based compensation expense and higher contracted services also contributed to the increase. These increases were partially offset by reduced variable compensation expense as a result of our financial performance and efficiencies related to our workforce reduction plan announced in August 2013. Sales and Marketing ExpensesFiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014Sales and marketing expenses increased for fiscal 2015, as compared with fiscal 2014, due to higher headcount-related expenses, driven by increased variable compensation expense and higher discretionary spending, partially offset by lower compensation expense from acquisitions. Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013Sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2014, as compared with fiscal 2013, decreased slightly due to lower advertising expenses, reductions in other discretionary spending, and lower expenses in other areas such as depreciation expense. These decreases were substantially offset by higher share based compensation expense and higher acquisition- related costs. G&A ExpensesFiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014G&A expenses increased in fiscal 2015, as compared with fiscal 2014, primarily due to increased variable compensation expense as a result of our financial performance, higher share-based compensation expense and the timing of corporate-level expenses. Corporate-level expenses, which tend to vary from period to period, included operational infrastructure activities such as IT project implementations, which included investments in our global data center infrastructure, and investments related to operational and financial systems.Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013G&A expenses decreased in fiscal 2014, as compared with fiscal 2013, due to lower contracted services, lower corporate-level expenses, and lower headcount-related expenses. The lower headcount-related expenses were due to efficiencies related to our workforce reduction plan announced in August 2013, and also due to reduced variable compensation expense as a result of our lower financial performance.55Table of ContentsEffect of Foreign CurrencyIn fiscal 2015, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $278 million, or 1.6%, compared with fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2014, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $153 million, or 0.9%, compared with fiscal 2013. HeadcountFiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014The decrease in headcount of approximately 2,200 employees in fiscal 2015 was due to headcount reductions from attrition and from our restructuring plan announced in August 2014. These headcount reductions were partially offset by headcount additions from targeted hiring in engineering and services, and also by headcount additions from our recent acquisitions. Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013Our headcount decreased by approximately 1,000 employees in fiscal 2014. The decrease was due to headcount reductions from attrition and from our workforce reduction plan announced in August 2013. These headcount reductions were partially offset by the increase in headcount from targeted hiring in engineering, services, sales, and also by increased headcount from our recent acquisitions. Share-Based Compensation ExpenseThe following table presents share-based compensation expense (in millions):Years Ended July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013Cost of sales—product $50 $45 $40Cost of sales—service 157 150 138Share-based compensation expense in cost of sales 207 195 178Research and development 448 411 286Sales and marketing 559 549 484General and administrative 228 198 175Restructuring and other charges (2) (5) (3)Share-based compensation expense in operating expenses 1,233 1,153 942Total share-based compensation expense $1,440 $1,348 $1,120The increase in share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2015, as compared with fiscal 2014, was due primarily to higher expense associated with performance-based restricted stock units and charges associated with severance arrangements with certain executives, partially offset by lower expense related to equity awards assumed with respect to our recent acquisitions.The increase in share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2014, as compared with fiscal 2013, was due primarily to share-based compensation expense attributable to equity awards assumed with respect to our recent acquisitions and higher forfeiture credits in fiscal 2013. 56Table of ContentsAmortization of Purchased Intangible AssetsThe following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets (in millions):Years Ended July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013Amortization of purchased intangible assets: Cost of sales $814 $742 $606Operating expenses 359 275 395Total $1,173 $1,017 $1,001Amortization of purchased intangible assets increased in fiscal 2015, compared with fiscal 2014, primarily due to the impairment charges of approximately $175 million recorded in fiscal 2015. The impairment charges were primarily due to declines in estimated fair value resulting from reductions in or the elimination of expected future cash flows associated with certain of our technology and IPR&D intangible assets. Amortization of purchased intangible assets increased in fiscal 2014 as compared with fiscal 2013, primarily due to amortization of purchased intangible assets from our recent acquisitions partially offset by certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized.The fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. We consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets. Restructuring and Other ChargesFiscal 2015 Plan In connection with a restructuring action announced in August 2014 (“Fiscal 2015 Plan”), we incurred restructuring and other charges of $489 million during fiscal 2015, which were related primarily to severance and other one-time termination benefits and other associated costs. We expect this plan to be substantially completed during the first half of fiscal 2016. We plan to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from the restructuring actions in key growth areas of our business such as data center, software, security, and cloud. The overall cost savings from these restructuring actions were not material for the periods presented and are not expected to be material for future periods.Fiscal 2014 Plan and Fiscal 2011 Plans In connection with a restructuring action announced in August 2013 (“Fiscal 2014 Plan”), we incurred restructuring and other charges of approximately $418 million during fiscal 2014 which were related primarily to employee severance charges for employees impacted by our workforce reduction under the Fiscal 2014 Plan. We completed the Fiscal 2014 Plan at the end of fiscal 2014. With regard to the Fiscal 2011 Plans (see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), we incurred restructuring and other charges of $105 million during fiscal 2013, which were related primarily to employee severance charges for employees impacted by our workforce reduction under these plans.Operating IncomeThe following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013Operating income $10,770 $9,345 $11,196Operating income as a percentage of revenue 21.9% 19.8% 23.0%For fiscal 2015, as compared with fiscal 2014, operating income increased by 15%, and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 2.1 percentage points. The increase resulted from the following: an increase in revenue; a gross margin percentage increase, driven in part by the $655 million supplier component remediation charge (or 1.4 percentage points of fiscal 2014 revenue) recorded in fiscal 2014; and higher compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2014 in connection with our acquisition of the remaining interest in Insieme.57Table of ContentsFor fiscal 2014, as compared with fiscal 2013, operating income decreased by 17%, and as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased by 3.2 percentage points. The decrease resulted from the following: a decrease in revenue; a gross margin percentage decline, driven in part by the $655 million supplier component remediation charge (or 1.4 percentage points of fiscal 2014 revenue); the $416 million compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2014 in connection with our acquisition of the remaining interest in Insieme; and an increase in restructuring and other charges related to the workforce reduction under the Fiscal 2014 Plan. Interest and Other Income (Loss), NetInterest Income (Expense), Net The following table summarizes interest income and interest expense (in millions): Years Ended 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 Variance in Dollars Variance in DollarsInterest income$769 $691 $654 $78 $37Interest expense(566) (564) (583) (2) 19Interest income (expense), net$203 $127 $71 $76 $56Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014Interest income increased in fiscal 2015 as compared with fiscal 2014, driven by an increase in our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and fixed income investments. Interest expense in fiscal 2015 as compared with the prior fiscal year increased slightly, driven by additional interest expense due to the net increase in long-term debt in fiscal 2015. Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013Interest income increased in fiscal 2014 as compared with fiscal 2013 due to the increase in our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and fixed income investments. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2014 as compared with the prior fiscal year was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of incremental interest rate swaps entered into during fiscal 2014 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. This decrease was partially offset by additional interest expense due to the increase in long-term debt in fiscal 2014.Other Income (Loss), Net The components of other income (loss), net, are summarized as follows (in millions): Years Ended 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013 Variance in Dollars Variance in DollarsGains (losses) on investments, net: Publicly traded equity securities$116 $253 $17 $(137) $236Fixed income securities41 47 31 (6) 16Total available-for-sale investments157 300 48 (143) 252Privately held companies82 (60) (57) 142 (3)Net gains (losses) on investments239 240 (9) (1) 249Other gains (losses), net(11) 3 (31) (14) 34Other income (loss), net$228 $243 $(40) $(15) $283Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014The decrease in total net gains on available-for-sale investments in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily attributable to lower gains on publicly traded equity securities in the current period as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities. The change in net gains (losses) on investments in privately held companies for the fiscal 2015 as compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily due to a $126 million gain recorded in fiscal 2015 related to the reorganization of our investments in VCE and lower losses related to this investment under the equity method. We ceased accounting for VCE under the equity method in October 2014. These favorable items were partially offset by higher impairment charges and lower realized gains from sales of various investments in privately held companies. The change in other gains (losses), net in fiscal 2015 as compared with fiscal 2014 was driven by equity derivative impacts and higher donation expenses, partially offset by net favorable foreign exchange impacts in fiscal 2015.58Table of ContentsFiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013The increase in total net gains on available-for-sale investments in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily attributable to higher gains on publicly traded equity securities in the current period as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities. The change in net losses on investments in privately held companies for the fiscal 2014 as compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to an increase of $40 million in our proportional share of losses from our VCE joint venture, partially offset by higher realized gains from various investments in privately held companies. The change in other gains (losses), net in fiscal 2014 as compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to higher gains on equity derivative instruments and lower donation expenses, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts in fiscal 2014.Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates, higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates, and expiration of or lapses in tax incentives. Our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries. If these earnings were distributed from the foreign subsidiaries to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes.Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 19.8% for fiscal 2015, compared with 19.2% for fiscal 2014. The net 0.6 percentage point increase in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was primarily due to a decrease in foreign income taxed at lower than U.S. rates, partially offset by an increase in U.S. federal R&D tax credit.For a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Fiscal 2014 Compared with Fiscal 2013The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 19.2% for fiscal 2014, compared with 11.1% for fiscal 2013. The net 8.1 percentage point increase in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was primarily attributable to a non-recurring net tax benefit of $794 million, or 7.1 percentage points, due to a tax settlement with the IRS in fiscal 2013.59Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowsCash and Cash Equivalents and Investments The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments (in millions): July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 Increase (Decrease)Cash and cash equivalents$6,877 $6,726 $151Fixed income securities51,974 43,396 8,578Publicly traded equity securities1,565 1,952 (387)Total$60,416 $52,074 $8,342The net increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of cash provided by operating activities of $12.6 billion, a net increase in debt of $4.5 billion and the net issuance of common stock of $1.5 billion pursuant to employee stock incentive and purchase plans. These sources of cash were partially offset by the repurchase of common stock of $4.3 billion under the stock repurchase program, cash dividends paid of $4.1 billion, capital expenditures of $1.2 billion and net cash paid for acquisitions of $0.3 billion. Our total in cash and cash equivalents and investments held by various foreign subsidiaries was $53.4 billion and $47.4 billion as of July 25, 2015 and July 26, 2014, respectively. Under current tax laws and regulations, if these assets were to be distributed from the foreign subsidiaries to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. The balance of cash and cash equivalents and investments available in the United States as of July 25, 2015 and July 26, 2014 was $7.0 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively. We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our fixed income investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below.Free Cash Flow and Capital Allocation As part of our capital allocation strategy, we intend to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment. The following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions):Years EndedJuly 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 July 27, 2013Net cash provided by operating activities$12,552 $12,332 $12,894Acquisition of property and equipment(1,227) (1,275) (1,160)Free cash flow$11,325 $11,057 $11,734We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue, excess tax benefits resulting from share-based compensation, and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. For additional discussion, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report.We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in60Table of Contentsaccordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net income provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do. The following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases (in millions, except per-share amounts): DIVIDENDS STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM TOTALYears Ended Per Share Amount Shares Weighted-Average Price per Share Amount AmountJuly 25, 2015 $0.80 $4,086 155 $27.22 $4,234 $8,320July 26, 2014 $0.72 $3,758 420 $22.71 $9,539 $13,297July 27, 2013 $0.62 $3,310 128 $21.63 $2,773 $6,083Any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. Accounts Receivable, Net The following table summarizes our accounts receivable, net (in millions), and DSO: July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 Increase (Decrease)Accounts receivable, net$5,344 $5,157 $187DSO38 38 —Our accounts receivable net, as of July 25, 2015 increased by approximately 4% compared with the end of fiscal 2014. Our DSO as of July 25, 2015 was flat compared with the end of fiscal 2014, as factors that drive DSO such as shipment linearity and collections were similar for the periods presented.Inventory Supply Chain The following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in millions, except annualized inventory turns): July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 Increase (Decrease)Inventories$1,627 $1,591 $36Annualized inventory turns12.1 12.7 (0.6)Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers$4,078 $4,169 $(91)Inventory as of July 25, 2015 increased by 2% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2014, and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by approximately 2%. On a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by 1% compared with the end of fiscal 2014. We believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts.Our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods. Distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers. Manufactured finished goods consist primarily of build-to-order and build-to-stock products.We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity.Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels.61Table of ContentsFinancing Receivables and Guarantees We measure our net balance sheet exposure position related to our financing receivables and financing guarantees by reducing the total of gross financing receivables and financing guarantees by the associated allowances for credit loss and deferred revenue. As of July 25, 2015, our net balance sheet exposure position related to financing receivables and financing guarantees was as follows (in millions): FINANCING RECEIVABLES FINANCING GUARANTEES July 25, 2015LeaseReceivables LoanReceivables Financed ServiceContracts and Other Total Channel Partner End-User Customers Total TOTALFinancing receivables and guarantees$3,395 $1,763 $3,573 $8,731 $288 $129 $417 $9,148Allowance for credit loss(259) (87) (36) (382) — — — (382)Deferred revenue(5) (13) (1,853) (1,871) (127) (107) (234) (2,105)Net balance sheet exposure$3,131 $1,663 $1,684 $6,478 $161 $22 $183 $6,661Financing Receivables Financing receivables less unearned income increased by 4% compared with the end of fiscal 2014. The change was primarily due to an 11% increase in financed service contracts and other, and a 5% increase in loan receivables, partially offset by a 4% decrease in lease receivables. We provide financing to certain end-user customers and channel partners to enable sales of our products, services, and networking solutions. These financing arrangements include leases, financed service contracts, and loans. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases. We also provide certain qualified customers financing for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services. Our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term.Financing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. The volume of channel partner financing was $25.9 billion, $24.6 billion, and $23.8 billion in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.2 billion as of each of July 25, 2015 and July 26, 2014. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. Deferred Revenue Related to Financing Receivables and Guarantees The majority of the deferred revenue in the preceding table is related to financed service contracts. The majority of the revenue related to financed service contracts, which primarily relates to technical support services, is deferred as the revenue related to financed service contracts is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed. A portion of the revenue related to lease and loan receivables is also deferred and included in deferred product revenue based on revenue recognition criteria not currently having been met.62Table of ContentsBorrowingsSenior Notes The following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes (in millions): Maturity Date July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 Senior notes: Floating-rate notes: Three-month LIBOR plus 0.05%September 3, 2015 $850 $850 Three-month LIBOR plus 0.28%March 3, 2017 1,000 1,000 Three-month LIBOR plus 0.31%June 15, 2018(1)900 — Three-month LIBOR plus 0.50%March 1, 2019 500 500 Fixed-rate notes: 2.90%November 17, 2014 — 500 5.50%February 22, 2016 3,000 3,000 1.10%March 3, 2017 2,400 2,400 3.15%March 14, 2017 750 750 1.65%June 15, 2018(1)1,600 — 4.95%February 15, 2019 2,000 2,000 2.125%March 1, 2019 1,750 1,750 4.45%January 15, 2020 2,500 2,500 2.45%June 15, 2020(1)1,500 — 2.90%March 4, 2021 500 500 3.00%June 15, 2022(1)500 — 3.625%March 4, 2024 1,000 1,000 3.50%June 15, 2025(1)500 — 5.90%February 15, 2039 2,000 2,000 5.50%January 15, 2040 2,000 2,000 Total $25,250 $20,750 (1) In June 2015, we issued senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $5.0 billion.Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable quarterly on the floating-rate notes. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of July 25, 2015.We repaid the fixed-rate notes (2.90%) due on November 17, 2014, for an aggregate principal amount of $500 million upon maturity.We repaid the floating-rate notes due on September 3, 2015 for an aggregate principal amount of $850 million upon maturity.Other Debt Other debt as of July 25, 2015 and July 26, 2014 includes secured borrowings associated with customer financing arrangements. The amount of borrowings outstanding under these arrangements was $4 million and $12 million as of July 25, 2015 and July 26, 2014, respectively.Commercial Paper In fiscal 2011, we established a short-term debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper notes. We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper notes outstanding as of each of July 25, 2015 and July 26, 2014.Credit Facility On May 15, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on May 15, 2020. Any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the highest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time, or (c) LIBOR, or a comparable or successor rate that is approved by the Administrative Agent (“Eurocurrency Rate”), for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, or (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate, plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., provided that in no event will the Eurocurrency Rate be less than zero. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that it maintains an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement. 63Table of ContentsWe may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and/or extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to May 15, 2022. We were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility. This credit facility replaces our prior credit facility that was entered into on February 17, 2012, which was terminated in connection with its entering into the new credit facility. Deferred Revenue The following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue (in millions): July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 Increase (Decrease)Service$9,757 $9,640 $117Product5,426 4,502 924 Total$15,183 $14,142 $1,041Reported as: Current$9,824 $9,478 $346Noncurrent5,359 4,664 695 Total$15,183 $14,142 $1,041Deferred product revenue increased 21% primarily due to increased deferrals related to subscription and software revenue arrangements and also, to a lesser extent, to an increase in shipments not having met revenue recognition criteria as of July 25, 2015. The product categories of Collaboration, Security, and Wireless were the key contributors to the increase. The increase in deferred service revenue in fiscal 2015 was driven by the timing of multiyear arrangements, an increase in customers paying technical support service contracts over time and the impact of ongoing amortization of deferred service revenue. Contractual ObligationsThe impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. In addition, we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at July 25, 2015 (in millions): PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIODJuly 25, 2015Total Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 YearsOperating leases$1,142 $346 $435 $178 $183Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers4,078 4,078 — — —Other purchase obligations2,012 604 815 536 57Long-term debt including the current portion25,251 3,850 6,651 8,250 6,500Other long-term liabilities1,213 — 350 72 791Total by period$33,696 $8,878 $8,251 $9,036 $7,531Other long-term liabilities (uncertainty in the timing of future payments)2,122 Total$35,818 Operating Leases For more information on our operating leases, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. A significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in “Inventory Supply Chain.” As of July 25, 2015, the liability for these purchase commitments was $156 million and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table.64Table of ContentsOther Purchase Obligations Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations. Long-Term Debt The amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, noncurrent deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $1,876 million and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of $246 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).Other CommitmentsIn connection with our business combinations and asset purchases, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Insieme Networks, Inc. In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we made an investment in Insieme, an early stage company focused on research and development in the data center market. As set forth in the agreement between Cisco and Insieme, this investment included $100 million of funding and a license to certain of our technology. Immediately prior to the call option exercise and acquisition described below, we owned approximately 83% of Insieme as a result of these investments and have consolidated the results of Insieme in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with this investment, we entered into a put/call option agreement that provided us with the right to purchase the remaining interests in Insieme. In addition, the noncontrolling interest holders could require us to purchase their shares upon the occurrence of certain events. During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we exercised our call option and entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining interests in Insieme. The acquisition closed in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, at which time the former noncontrolling interest holders became eligible to receive up to two milestone payments, which will be determined using agreed-upon formulas based primarily on revenue for certain of Insieme’s products. During fiscal 2015 and 2014, we recorded compensation expense of $207 million and $416 million, respectively, related to the fair value of the vested portion of amounts that were earned or expected to be earned by the former noncontrolling interest holders. Continued vesting and changes to the fair value of the amounts probable of being earned will result in adjustments to the recorded compensation expense in future periods. Based on the terms of the agreement, we have determined that the maximum amount that could be recorded as compensation expense by us is approximately $843 million (which includes the $623 million that has been expensed to date), net of forfeitures. The milestone payments, to the extent earned, are expected to be paid primarily during the first half of each of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017.Other Funding Commitments We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $205 million as of July 25, 2015, compared with $255 million as of July 26, 2014.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements. In the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers. These privately held companies and customers may be considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings, and we have determined that as of July 25, 2015 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities.On an ongoing basis, we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing Receivables and Guarantees.”65Table of ContentsSecurities LendingWe periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale investments. These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. The average daily balance of securities lending for fiscal 2015 and 2014 was $0.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. As of July 25, 2015 and July 26, 2014, we had no outstanding securities lending transactions. We believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements. Liquidity and Capital Resource RequirementsBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources. 66Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskOur financial position is exposed to a variety of risks, including interest rate risk, equity price risk, and foreign currency exchange risk.Interest Rate RiskFixed Income Securities We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk. At any time, a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates, including the impact from lower credit spreads, could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives. We had no outstanding hedging instruments for our fixed income securities as of July 25, 2015. Our fixed income investments are held for purposes other than trading. Our fixed income investments are not leveraged as of July 25, 2015. We monitor our interest rate and credit risks, including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers. As of July 25, 2015, approximately 65% of our fixed income securities balance consisted of U.S. government and U.S. government agency securities. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong. The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our fixed income securities, including the hedging effects when applicable, as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates. The market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (“BPS”), plus 100 BPS, and plus 150 BPS. Due to the low interest rate environment at the end of each of fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, we did not believe a parallel shift of minus 100 BPS or minus 150 BPS was relevant. The hypothetical fair values as of July 25, 2015 and July 26, 2014 are as follows (in millions): VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTS FAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 25, 2015 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPSFixed income securitiesN/A N/A $52,366 $51,974 $51,582 $51,189 $50,797 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTS FAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 26, 2014 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPSFixed income securitiesN/A N/A $43,721 $43,396 $43,071 $42,747 $42,422Financing Receivables As of July 25, 2015, our financing receivables had a carrying value of $8.3 billion, compared with $8.1 billion as of July 26, 2014. As of July 25, 2015, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.1 billion, respectively. Debt As of July 25, 2015, we had $25.3 billion in principal amount of senior notes outstanding, which consisted of $3.3 billion floating-rate notes and $22.0 billion fixed-rate notes. The carrying amount of the senior notes was $25.4 billion, and the related fair value based on market prices was $26.6 billion. As of July 25, 2015, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed-rate debt, excluding the $11.4 billion of hedged debt, by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.4 billion, respectively. However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed-rate debt that is not hedged.67Table of ContentsEquity Price RiskThe fair value of our equity investments in publicly traded companies is subject to market price volatility. We may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio. Our equity portfolio consists of securities with characteristics that most closely match the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index or NASDAQ Composite Index. These equity securities are held for purposes other than trading. To manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain equity securities, we may enter into equity derivatives designated as hedging instruments.Publicly Traded Equity Securities The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of publicly traded equity securities as a result of selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each equity security in the portfolio, excluding hedged equity securities, if any. Potential fluctuations in the price of each equity security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 20%, and 30% were selected based on potential near-term changes in those security prices. The hypothetical fair values as of July 25, 2015 and July 26, 2014 are as follows (in millions): VALUATION OFSECURITIESGIVEN AN X%DECREASE INEACH STOCK’S PRICE FAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 25, 2015 VALUATION OFSECURITIESGIVEN AN X%INCREASE INEACH STOCK’S PRICE (30)% (20)% (10)% 10% 20% 30%Publicly traded equity securities$1,096 $1,252 $1,409 $1,565 $1,722 $1,878 $2,035 VALUATION OFSECURITIESGIVEN AN X%DECREASE INEACH STOCK’S PRICE FAIR VALUE AS OF JULY 26, 2014 VALUATION OFSECURITIESGIVEN AN X%INCREASE INEACH STOCK’S PRICE (30)% (20)% (10)% 10% 20% 30%Publicly traded equity securities$1,144 $1,307 $1,471 $1,634 $1,797 $1,961 $2,124Investments in Privately Held Companies We have also invested in privately held companies. These investments are recorded in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are accounted for using primarily either the cost or the equity method. As of July 25, 2015, the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was $897 million, compared with $899 million at July 26, 2014. Some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including, among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return. 68Table of ContentsForeign Currency Exchange RiskOur foreign exchange forward and option contracts outstanding at fiscal year-end are summarized in U.S. dollar equivalents as follows (in millions): July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair ValueForward contracts: Purchased$1,988 $(5) $2,635 $(3)Sold$614 $2 $896 $2Option contracts: Purchased$422 $6 $494 $5Sold$392 $(3) $466 $(2)We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, as was the case during fiscal 2015, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations.Approximately 70% of our operating expenses are U.S.-dollar denominated. In fiscal 2015, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased our combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $278 million, or 1.6%, compared with fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2014, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased our combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $153 million, or 0.9% as compared with fiscal 2013. To reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by non-U.S.-dollar denominated operating expenses and costs, we hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts. These hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons. In designing a specific hedging approach, we consider several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of exposures, costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument, and potential effectiveness of the hedge. The gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales.We also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities. The market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables, investments, and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances. Our forward and option contracts generally have the following maturities: MaturitiesForward and option contracts—forecasted transactions related to operating expenses and service cost of sales Up to 18 monthsForward contracts—current assets and liabilities Up to 3 monthsForward contracts—net investments in foreign subsidiaries Up to 6 monthsForward contracts—long-term customer financings Up to 2 yearsWe do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for trading purposes.69Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:09:29.516889

For over 30 years, we have helped our customers build networks and automate, orchestrate, integrate, and digitize information technology (IT)–based products and services. In an increasingly connected world, Cisco is helping to transform businesses, governments and cities worldwide. Over time, we have expanded to new markets that are a natural extension of our core networking business, as the network has become the platform for delivering an ever-increasing portfolio of IT–based products and services. A summary of our results is as follows (in millions, except percentages and per-share amounts): Three Months Ended Years Ended July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 Variance July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 Variance Revenue (1)$12,638 $12,843 (1.6)% $49,247 $49,161 0.2 % Gross margin percentage63.1% 60.2% 2.9pts62.9% 60.4% 2.5ptsResearch and development$1,601 $1,548 3.4 % $6,296 $6,207 1.4 % Sales and marketing$2,443 $2,549 (4.2)% $9,619 $9,821 (2.1)% General and administrative$533 $536 (0.6)% $1,814 $2,040 (11.1)% Total R&D, sales and marketing, general and administrative$4,577 $4,633 (1.2)% $17,729 $18,068 (1.9)% Total as a percentage of revenue36.2% 36.1% 0.1pts36.0% 36.8% (0.8)pts Amortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses$82 $146 (43.8)% $303 $359 (15.6)% Restructuring and other charges included in operating expenses$13 $73 (82.2)% $268 $484 (44.6)% Operating income as a percentage of revenue26.1% 22.4% 3.7pts25.7% 21.9% 3.8ptsIncome tax percentage17.1% 20.9% (3.8)pts16.9% 19.8% (2.9)ptsNet income$2,813 $2,319 21.3 % $10,739 $8,981 19.6 % Net income as a percentage of revenue22.3% 18.1% 4.2pts21.8% 18.3% 3.5ptsEarnings per share—diluted$0.56 $0.45 24.4 % $2.11 $1.75 20.6 % (1) During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed the sale of the SP Video CPE Business. As a result, revenue from this portion of the Service Provider Video product category will not recur in future periods. The three months ended July 25, 2015 includes SP Video CPE Business revenue of $487 million. The years ended July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015 include SP Video CPE Business revenue of $504 million and $1,846 million, respectively. 36Table of ContentsFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015—Financial PerformanceFor fiscal 2016, our total revenue was flat compared with fiscal 2015, as the service revenue increase of 5% was substantially offset by the product revenue decrease of 1%. In the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed the sale of our SP Video CPE Business. Total company revenue for fiscal 2016 increased 3% not including revenue from SP Video CPE products for all periods. Additionally, fiscal 2016 had 53 weeks, compared with 52 weeks in fiscal 2015, thus our results for fiscal 2016 reflect an extra week compared with fiscal 2015. We estimate that the additional revenue associated with the extra week was approximately $265 million, $200 million of which was from our services subscriptions, and $65 million from our software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings such as WebEx, and a small amount from product distribution. Total gross margin increased by 2.5 percentage points, driven by productivity improvements, the sale of the lower margin SP Video CPE Business, and higher service gross margin. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, decreased by 0.8 percentage points, driven in part by the $253 million pre-tax gain from the sale of the SP Video CPE Business. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 3.8 percentage points, driven by the factors discussed above as well as a decrease in restructuring and other charges related to the restructuring action announced in August 2014. Diluted earnings per share increased by 21% from the prior year, as a result of both a 20% increase in net income and a decrease in diluted share count of 58 million shares. Revenue from the Americas decreased by $244 million, driven by the sale of the SP Video CPE Business. Revenue for the Americas segment increased not including SP Video CPE products. EMEA revenue decreased by $41 million, led by a product revenue decline in Russia. Revenue in our APJC segment increased $371 million, led by product revenue growth in China. We saw improvements in our revenue from many emerging countries, and in particular we experienced product revenue growth in the emerging countries of China, India and Mexico of 22%, 18% and 3%, respectively. The “BRICM” countries experienced, in the aggregate, product revenue growth of 3%, despite decreased product revenue in Brazil and Russia of 34% and 31%, respectively. From a customer market standpoint, in fiscal 2016 we experienced solid product revenue growth in the commercial market and, to a lesser extent, in the public sector and enterprise markets, while the service provider market declined. The decline in the service provider market was driven by the sale of the SP Video CPE Business. From a product category perspective, total company product revenue, not including SP Video CPE products, increased 2% year over year. This increase was led by product revenue growth in Security and Collaboration which grew 13% and 9%, respectively. We also experienced a 12% increase in revenue from Service Provider Video products (not including the CPE Business for all periods), as well as Data Center and Wireless products which grew 5% and 3%, respectively. Offsetting these increases was a 4% product revenue decrease in our NGN Routing category, driven primarily by a decrease in sales of our high-end router products. In addition, we believe a cautious service provider capital expenditure spending environment negatively impacted sales in this product category. Sales of our Switching products were flat due to higher sales of data center switches, flat sales of switches used in campus environments (which comprises the majority of this product category), and lower sales of storage products. We believe the flat sales of switches used in campus environments was largely driven by uncertainty in the macro environment, which led to a slowdown in customer spending.Over this past fiscal year, we experienced a challenging environment with significant volatility and a highly competitive landscape. After three consecutive quarters of positive business momentum in both the service provider customer market and emerging countries in the aggregate, these areas experienced a decline in business momentum during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, while the remainder of the business performed well with positive business momentum. In summary, for fiscal 2016 we experienced solid revenue growth in Security, Switching products used in data centers, Collaboration, and our Services categories. In addition, we continued to make progress in the transition of our business model to software and subscriptions. We remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we believe that we have made solid progress over the past year in these priority areas. While the overall macro environment remains uncertain, we believe we are well positioned. At the same time, we are aggressively investing in priority areas to drive growth over the long term regardless of the environment.37Table of ContentsFourth Quarter SnapshotFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2015, total revenue decreased by 2%. Within the total revenue, product revenue decreased 4% while service revenue increased by 5%. Total company revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 increased 2% not including revenue from SP Video CPE products (which was sold on November 20, 2015) in the prior year period. With regard to our geographic segment performance, on a year-over-year basis, revenue in the Americas and APJC each decreased by 2%, while EMEA was flat. From a product category perspective, total company product revenue, not including SP Video CPE products in the prior year period, increased 1% year over year. This increase was driven by growth from Security products which grew 16% year over year. Total gross margin increased by 2.9 percentage points, as results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 did not include the lower margin SP Video CPE Business. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively increased by 0.1 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 3.7 percentage points. Diluted earnings per share increased by 24% from the prior year, primarily as a result of both a 21% increase in net income and a decrease in our diluted share count by 64 million shares. Strategy and Focus AreasWe see our customers increasingly using technology and, specifically, networks to grow their businesses, drive efficiencies, and try to gain a competitive advantage. In this increasingly digital world, we believe data is the most strategic asset and is increasingly distributed across every organization and ecosystem, on customer premises, at the edge of the network, and in the cloud. The network also plays an increasingly important role enabling our customers to aggregate, automate, and draw insights from this highly distributed data, where there is a premium on security and speed. We believe this is driving them to adopt entirely new IT architectures and organizational structures. We understand how technology can deliver the outcomes our customers want to achieve, and our strategy is to lead our customers in their digital transition with solutions including pervasive, industry-leading security that intelligently connects nearly everything that can be digitally connected.To deliver on our strategy, we are focused on providing highly secure, automated and intelligent solutions built on infrastructure that connects highly distributed data that is globally dispersed across organizations. Together with our ecosystem of partners and developers, we will provide technology, services, and solutions we believe will enable our customers to gain insight and advantage from this distributed data with scale, security and agility. For a full discussion of our strategy and focus areas, see Item 1. Business.Other Key Financial MeasuresThe following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 (in millions, except days sales outstanding in accounts receivable (DSO) and annualized inventory turns): Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015Cash and cash equivalents and investments $65,756 $60,416Cash provided by operating activities $13,570 $12,552Deferred revenue $16,472 $15,183Repurchases of common stock—stock repurchase program $3,918 $4,234Dividends $4,750 $4,086DSO 42 days 38 daysInventories $1,217 $1,627Annualized inventory turns 14.6 12.138Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met:•Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Contracts, Internet commerce agreements, and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.•Delivery has occurred. Shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery. For software, delivery is considered to have occurred upon unrestricted license access and license term commencement, when applicable.•The fee is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.•Collectibility is reasonably assured. We assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer’s payment history.In instances where final acceptance of the product, system, or solution is specified by the customer, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. When a sale involves multiple deliverables, such as sales of products that include services, the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting, and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price. Revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met. For hosting arrangements, we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the subscription period, while usage revenue is recognized based on utilization. Software subscription revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription term upon delivery of the first product and commencement of the term. The amount of revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and, if so, our valuation of the units of accounting. Our multiple element arrangements may contain only deliverables within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605, Revenue Recognition, deliverables within the scope of ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition, or a combination of both. According to the accounting guidance prescribed in ASC 605, we use vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE) for each of those units, when available. We determine VSOE based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the historical standalone transactions have the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range, generally evidenced by approximately 80% of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus 15% of the median rates. When VSOE does not exist, we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multiple-deliverable arrangements. Under the selling price hierarchy, third-party evidence of selling price (TPE) will be considered if VSOE does not exist, and estimated selling price (ESP) will be used if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Generally, we are not able to determine TPE because our go-to-market strategy differs from that of others in our markets, and the extent of our proprietary technology varies among comparable products or services from those of our peers. In determining ESP, we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors, based on the characteristics of the deliverable. We typically arrive at an ESP for a product or service that is not sold separately by considering company-specific factors such as geographies, competitive landscape, internal costs, profitability objectives, pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing, and existing portfolio pricing and discounting. As our business and offerings evolve over time, our pricing practices may be required to be modified accordingly, which could result in changes in selling prices, including both VSOE and ESP, in subsequent periods. There were no material impacts during fiscal 2016, nor do we currently expect a material impact in the next 12 months on our revenue recognition due to any changes in our VSOE, TPE, or ESP. We make sales to distributors which we refer to as two-tier sales to the end customer. Revenue from two-tier distributors is recognized based on a sell-through method using point-of-sale information provided by these distributors. Distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other incentive programs, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs. If actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.39Table of ContentsAllowances for Receivables and Sales ReturnsThe allowances for receivables were as follows (in millions, except percentages): July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015Allowance for doubtful accounts $249 $302Percentage of gross accounts receivable 4.1% 5.4%Allowance for credit loss—lease receivables $230 $259Percentage of gross lease receivables (1) 6.6% 7.2%Allowance for credit loss—loan receivables $97 $87Percentage of gross loan receivables 4.5% 4.9%(1) Calculated as allowance for credit loss on lease receivables as a percentage of gross lease receivables and residual value before unearned income.The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience, credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay as well as historical and expected default frequency rates, which are published by major third-party credit-rating agencies and are updated on a quarterly basis. We also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts. If a major customer’s creditworthiness deteriorates, if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, or if other circumstances arise, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, and additional allowances could be required, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.The allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis. When evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis, we consider historical experience, credit quality and age of receivable balances, and economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. When evaluating financing receivables on a collective basis, we use expected default frequency rates published by a major third-party credit-rating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default, while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions, concentration of risk and correlation. Determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings, as well as assessing factors such as economic conditions, concentration of risk, and correlation, are complex and subjective. Our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results. Both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible.A reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. The reserve for future sales returns as of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015 was $126 million and $129 million, respectively, and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue. If the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established, our revenue could be adversely affected. Inventory Valuation and Liability for Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and SuppliersInventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories, determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of our cost of sales. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. As of July 30, 2016, the liability for these purchase commitments was $159 million, compared with $156 million as of July 25, 2015, and was included in other current liabilities.40Table of ContentsOur provision for inventory was $65 million, $54 million, and $67 million in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was $134 million, $102 million, and $124 million in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we could be required to increase our inventory write-downs, and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and accordingly our profitability, could be adversely affected. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments. Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence, particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainties and conditions and the resulting potential for changes in future demand forecast. Loss Contingencies and Product WarrantiesWe are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.We have recorded a liability for the expected remediation cost for certain products sold in prior fiscal years containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010. In February 2014, on the basis of the growing number of failures as described in Note 12 (f) to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we decided to expand our approach, which resulted in a charge to product cost of sales of $655 million being recorded for the second quarter of fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2016 and 2015, we recorded adjustments to product cost of sales of $74 million and $164 million, respectively to reduce the liability, reflecting net lower than previously estimated future costs to remediate the impacted customer products. Estimating this liability is complex and subjective, and if we experience changes in a number of underlying assumptions and estimates such as a change in claims compared with our expectations, or if the cost of servicing these claims is different than expected, our estimated liability may be impacted.Our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years, and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty. We accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs, technical support labor costs, and associated overhead. Material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment. Technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period. Overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities.If we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected, our profitability could be adversely affected.Fair Value MeasurementsOur fixed income and publicly traded equity securities, collectively, are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at a fair value of $58.1 billion as of July 30, 2016, compared with $53.5 billion as of July 25, 2015. Our fixed income investment portfolio, as of July 30, 2016, consisted primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.As described more fully in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a valuation hierarchy is based on the level of independent, objective evidence available regarding the value of the investments. It encompasses three classes of investments: Level 1 consists of securities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical securities; Level 2 consists of securities for which observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs are used, such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets and model-derived valuations for which the variables are derived from, or corroborated by, observable market data; and Level 3 consists of securities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value.41Table of ContentsOur Level 2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. We use inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from independent pricing vendors, quoted market prices, or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities. We use such pricing data as the primary input, to which we have not made any material adjustments during fiscal 2016 and 2015, to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio. We are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates.The inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness, may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information, and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to its estimate of fair value. The assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective. However, given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio, and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets, we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of subjectivity and judgment was material to the valuation of the investment portfolio as of July 30, 2016. Level 3 assets do not represent a significant portion of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015.Other-than-Temporary Impairments We recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary. The ultimate value realized on these securities, to the extent unhedged, is subject to market price volatility until they are sold.If the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary. An impairment is considered other than temporary if (i) we have the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on (i) or (ii) described in the prior sentence, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (iii), the amount representing credit loss, defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security, will be recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). In estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected, we consider all available information, including past events, current conditions, the remaining payment terms of the security, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults, and the value of underlying collateral.For publicly traded equity securities, we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.We also have investments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages. As of July 30, 2016, our investments in privately held companies were $1,003 million, compared with $897 million as of July 25, 2015, and were included in other assets. We monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment, and we make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required, based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. Our impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were $67 million, $41 million, and $23 million in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.42Table of ContentsGoodwill and Purchased Intangible Asset ImpairmentsOur methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.The goodwill recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015 was $26.6 billion and $24.5 billion, respectively. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014. For the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2016, the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was $40.8 billion for the Americas, $29.4 billion for EMEA, and $13.1 billion for APJC. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. The fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. We consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were $74 million and $175 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. There were no impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets during fiscal 2014. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R&D tax credits, domestic manufacturing deductions, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, international realignments, and transfer pricing adjustments. Our effective tax rate was 16.9%, 19.8%, and 19.2% in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.43Table of ContentsOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany R&D cost-sharing arrangement and legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including possible changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 34 countries, including the United States, has recently made changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. As a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.

Our revenue, which includes product and service for each segment, is summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentRevenue: Americas $29,411 $29,655 $27,781 $(244) (0.8)% $1,874 6.7 %Percentage of revenue 59.7% 60.3% 58.9% EMEA 12,281 12,322 12,006 (41) (0.3)% 316 2.6 %Percentage of revenue 24.9% 25.1% 25.5% APJC 7,555 7,184 7,355 371 5.2 % (171) (2.3)%Percentage of revenue 15.4% 14.6% 15.6% Total $49,247 $49,161 $47,142 $86 0.2 % $2,019 4.3 %44Table of ContentsFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015 For fiscal 2016, as compared with fiscal 2015, total revenue was flat. Total company revenue not including SP Video CPE products increased 3%. Product revenue decreased by1% in total, but increased by 2% for product revenue not including SP Video CPE products. Service revenue increased by 5%. Fiscal 2016 had 53 weeks, compared with 52 weeks in fiscal 2015, thus our results for fiscal 2016 reflect an extra week. We estimate that the additional revenue associated with the extra week was approximately $265 million, $200 million of which was from our services subscriptions, and $65 million from our SaaS offerings such as WebEx, and a small amount from product distribution. Our total revenue grew in our APJC geographic segment, while revenue declined in the Americas and EMEA geographic segments. The emerging countries of BRICM, in the aggregate, experienced 3% product revenue growth, with growth in China, India and Mexico, partially offset by decreases in the other two BRICM countries. We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, as was the case during fiscal 2016, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations. Our revenue in fiscal 2016 was adversely affected by the depreciation of certain currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and especially currencies in certain emerging countries, although the indirect effects are difficult to measure.In addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced IT spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple-element arrangements; the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment. As has been the case in certain emerging countries from time to time, customers require greater levels of financing arrangements, service, and support, and these activities may occur in future periods, which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue.Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014 For fiscal 2015, as compared with fiscal 2014, total revenue increased by 4%, as product and service revenue each increased by 4%. Our total revenue grew in our Americas and EMEA geographic segments, while revenue declined in the APJC segment. The emerging countries of BRICM, in the aggregate, experienced a 4% product revenue decline, with declines in China and Russia partially offset by increases in the other three BRICM countries.Product Revenue by SegmentThe following table presents the breakdown of product revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentProduct revenue: Americas $21,679 $22,261 $20,631 $(582) (2.6)% $1,630 7.9 %Percentage of product revenue 58.2% 59.0% 57.0% EMEA 9,658 9,856 9,655 (198) (2.0)% 201 2.1 %Percentage of product revenue 25.9% 26.1% 26.7% APJC 5,917 5,633 5,886 284 5.0 % (253) (4.3)%Percentage of product revenue 15.9% 14.9% 16.3% Total $37,254 $37,750 $36,172 $(496) (1.3)% $1,578 4.4 %During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed the sale of our SP Video CPE Business. As a result, fiscal 2016 includes only four months of product revenue from our SP Video CPE Business. Revenue from this portion of the Service Provider Video product category will not recur in future periods. SP Video CPE Business revenue was $504 million, $1,846 million and $2,240 million for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.45Table of ContentsAmericasFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015The decrease in product revenue for the Americas segment was driven by a decline of $1,146 million in product sales related to our SP Video CPE Business. Product revenue not including SP Video CPE products increased for the Americas segment. From a customer markets perspective, the decrease in product revenue in the Americas segment of 3% was led by a significant decline in the service provider market driven by the sale of the SP Video CPE Business. We experienced product revenue growth in the commercial, public sector and enterprise markets. The product revenue growth in the public sector market was due primarily to higher sales to state and local governments, partially offset by lower sales to the U.S. federal government. From a country perspective, product revenue decreased by 34% in Brazil and 24% in Canada partially offset by a slight increase in the United States and an increase of 3% in Mexico. Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014The increase in product revenue in the Americas segment of 8% was led by solid growth in the public sector, commercial and enterprise markets. The product revenue growth in the public sector market was due primarily to higher sales to the U.S. federal government and, to a lesser extent, higher sales to state and local governments. The product revenue growth in the enterprise and commercial markets was driven by strength in the United States. We experienced a product revenue decline in the service provider market in this segment. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 8% in the United States, 34% in Mexico, and 2% in Brazil. EMEAFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015The decrease in product revenue of 2%, or $198 million, for the EMEA segment was driven by a decline of $164 million in product sales related to our SP Video CPE Business. From a customer market perspective, the decrease was driven by product revenue declines in the service provider, public sector and enterprise markets, partially offset by product revenue growth in the commercial market. The decline in sales to the service provider market was due primarily to the sale of the SP Video CPE Business. Product revenue from emerging countries within EMEA decreased by 11%, led by a decline in Russia of 31%. Product revenue for the remainder of the EMEA segment, which primarily consists of countries in Western Europe, increased by 1%.Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014Product revenue in the EMEA segment increased by 2%, driven by growth in the commercial, public sector and enterprise markets. Product revenue in the service provider market was flat. Product revenue from emerging countries within EMEA increased by 1% and product revenue for the remainder of EMEA grew by 2%. APJCFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015The increase in product revenue in the APJC segment of 5% was led by solid growth in the service provider market and, to a lesser extent, growth in the enterprise, public sector and commercial markets. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 22% in China, driven by an increase in sales of Service Provider Video software and solutions products, and 18% in India, partially offset by product revenue decreases of 7% in Japan and 5% in Australia. Product revenue for this geographic segment was adversely impacted by a $32 million decrease in product revenue related to the sale of our SP Video CPE Business.Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014The decrease in product revenue in the APJC segment of 4% was led by a significant decline in the service provider market and, to a lesser degree, in the public sector and enterprise markets. These decreases were partially offset by growth in the commercial market. From a country perspective, product revenue decreased by 21% in China and 5% in Japan. We experienced product revenue growth of 15% in India and 8% in Australia. 46Table of ContentsProduct Revenue by Groups of Similar ProductsIn addition to the primary view on a geographic basis, we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes. Our product categories consist of the following categories (with subcategories in parentheses): Switching (fixed switching, modular switching, and storage); NGN Routing (high-end routers, mid-range and low-end routers, and other NGN Routing products); Collaboration (unified communications, Cisco TelePresence, and conferencing); Data Center; Wireless; Service Provider Video (video software and solutions, and cable access); Security; and Other Products. The Other Products category consists primarily of emerging technology products and other networking products.The following table presents revenue for groups of similar products (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentProduct revenue: Switching $14,746 $14,740 $14,001 $6 — % $739 5.3 %Percentage of product revenue 39.6% 39.1% 38.7% NGN Routing 7,408 7,704 7,606 (296) (3.8)% 98 1.3 %Percentage of product revenue 19.9% 20.4% 21.0% Collaboration 4,352 4,004 3,817 348 8.7 % 187 4.9 %Percentage of product revenue 11.7% 10.6% 10.6% Data Center 3,365 3,219 2,640 146 4.5 % 579 21.9 %Percentage of product revenue 9.0% 8.5% 7.3% Wireless 2,625 2,542 2,293 83 3.3 % 249 10.9 %Percentage of product revenue 7.0% 6.7% 6.3% Service Provider Video (1) 2,424 3,555 3,969 (1,131) (31.8)% (414) (10.4)%Percentage of product revenue 6.5% 9.4% 11.0% Security 1,969 1,747 1,566 222 12.7 % 181 11.6 %Percentage of product revenue 5.3% 4.6% 4.3% Other 365 239 280 126 52.7 % (41) (14.6)%Percentage of product revenue 1.0% 0.7% 0.8% $37,254 $37,750 $36,172 $(496) (1.3)% $1,578 4.4 %(1) During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed the sale of the SP Video CPE Business. As a result, fiscal 2016 includes only four months of product revenue from SP Video CPE Business. Includes SP Video CPE Business revenue of $504 million, $1,846 million and $2,240 million for fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period amounts to conform to the current period’s presentation. SwitchingFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015We believe the flat revenue growth in our Switching product category was driven in large part by the uncertainty in the macro environment which led to a slowdown in customer spending. This led to flat growth in our Switching products used in campus environments which comprise the majority of revenue within this product category. We also experienced decreased revenue from storage products. These impacts were offset by an increase in sales of our Switching products used in data centers, reflecting strength in our Application Centric Infrastructure portfolio. In terms of subcategories, the increase in revenue from LAN fixed-configuration switches of 5%, or $469 million was substantially offset by decreased revenue from our modular switches of 8%, or $375 million, and the decreased revenue from storage products of 17%, or $88 million. Revenue from our LAN-fixed configuration switches increased due primarily to higher sales of our Cisco Catalyst 3850 Series Switches, Cisco Catalyst 3650 Series Switches, Cisco Nexus 9300 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches, partially offset by a decrease in sales of certain other products in this portfolio. Decreased revenue from our modular switches was due primarily to lower sales of most of our Cisco Catalyst Series Switches and also due to lower sales of our Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches, partially offset by sales growth in Cisco Nexus 9500 Series Switches within this product category. 47Table of Contents Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014The increase in revenue in our Switching product category of 5%, or $739 million, was driven by a 9%, or $826 million, increase in revenue from our LAN fixed-configuration switches and, to a lesser extent, a 24%, or $101 million, increase in sales of storage products. Revenue from LAN fixed-configuration switches increased due to higher sales of most of our Cisco Nexus Series Switches and Cisco Catalyst Series Switches within this category. We experienced a decrease in revenue from our modular switches of 4%, or $188 million, driven by lower sales of Cisco Catalyst 6500-E Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches.NGN RoutingFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015We believe a cautious service provider capital expenditure spending environment negatively impacted sales in NGN Routing. Revenue in this product category decreased by 4%, or $296 million, driven by an 8%, or $378 million, decrease in revenue from our high-end router products partially offset by an 11%, or $48 million, increase in revenue from what we categorize as other NGN Routing products and a 1%, or $34 million, increase in revenue from our mid-range and low-end router products. Revenue from high-end router products decreased due to a decrease in revenue from most of our high-end router products, partially offset by higher sales of our CRS-X products. Revenue from other NGN Routing products increased due to higher sales of optical networking products. The revenue increase in the mid-range and low-end routers was primarily driven by higher sales of Cisco ISR products.Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014Revenue in our NGN Routing product category increased by 1%, or $98 million, driven by a 6%, or $248 million, increase in revenue from our high-end router products and a slight increase in revenue from our midrange and low-end router products, partially offset by 28%, or $171 million, decrease in revenue from other NGN Routing products. Revenue from high-end router products increased due to an increase in revenue from most products within our Cisco ASR category and the adoption of our Cisco NCS platform and CRS-X, partially offset by lower sales of our legacy high-end router products. The slight increase in revenue from our midrange and low-end router products was due to higher sales of our Cisco ISR products, partially offset by lower sales of certain of our access products. Revenue from other NGN Routing products decreased primarily due to lower sales of certain optical networking products. CollaborationFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015Revenue from our Collaboration product category increased by 9%, or $348 million, driven by growth across the various subcategories within this product category. The growth in Conferencing revenue resulted from higher usage and recurring revenue from WebEx, which we include as product revenue in this category. Revenue from Cisco TelePresence products grew due to higher revenue in infrastructure and endpoint products as a result of new product introductions. The increase in Unified Communications revenue was driven by higher software revenue. We continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our Collaboration product category. Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014Revenue in our Collaboration product category increased by 5%, or $187 million, due to increased revenue from our Unified Communications products as a result of higher software revenue and a slight increase in revenue from phones. Higher revenue from our Cisco TelePresence and conferencing products also contributed to the increase. Revenue from Cisco TelePresence products increased due to higher revenue in endpoint products as a result of new product introductions. The increase in conferencing revenue was a result of higher recurring revenue. We continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our Collaboration product category.Data CenterFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015The increase in revenue in our Data Center product category of 5%, or $146 million, was primarily driven by an increase in sales of our Cisco Unified Computing System products, with growth across all geographic segments and most of the customer markets. We believe the uncertainty in the macro environment led to a slowdown of customer spending for products in this category. Additionally, we are seeing a market transition with computing workloads shifting from blade server systems to rack-based systems. We believe both of these factors adversely impacted the sales of this product category.48Table of ContentsFiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014Revenue in our Data Center product category grew by 22%, or $579 million, with sales growth of our Cisco Unified Computing System products across all geographic segments and customer markets. The increase was due in large part to the continued momentum we are experiencing in both data center and cloud environments, as current customers increase their data center build-outs and as new customers deploy these offerings.WirelessFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015Revenue in our Wireless product category increased by 3%, or $83 million, due primarily to continued growth in sales of Meraki products within this category, partially offset by a decrease in sales of our controllers products. We continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our Wireless product category.Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014Revenue in our Wireless product category increased by 11%, or $249 million, driven by continued growth in sales of Meraki products combined with continued strength in our 802.11ac portfolio. We continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our Wireless product category.Service Provider VideoFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015The decrease in revenue from our Service Provider Video product category of 32%, or $1,131 million, was driven by a decrease in product sales of $1,342 million related to our SP Video CPE Business which we sold during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue from certain cable access products and an increase in revenue from our video software and solutions products, particularly in China.Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014The decrease in revenue from our Service Provider Video product category of 10%, or $414 million, was driven by a 16%, or $332 million, decrease in sales of our Service Provider Video infrastructure products, due primarily to lower sales of set-top boxes. We also experienced a decrease in revenue from cable access products within this product category. SecurityFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015Revenue in our Security product category increased 13%, or $222 million, driven by higher sales of advanced threat security, web security and unified threat management products. We continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our Security product category.Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014Revenue in our Security product category was up 12%, or $181 million, driven primarily by sales of Sourcefire products and, to a lesser extent, by higher sales of our high-end firewall products within our network security product portfolio. This increase was partially offset by a slight decrease in revenue from our content security products due to lower sales of web and e-mail security products. We continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our Security product category.Other ProductsThe year-over-year increase in revenue in our Other Products category for fiscal 2016 was due to increased revenue from data and analytics offerings, from our cloud-related offerings and from our IoT products, driven by our Jasper acquisition. We experienced a year-over-year decrease in revenue in our Other Products category for fiscal 2015 due in large part to the decrease in sales of our other networking products. 49Table of ContentsService Revenue by SegmentThe following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014Years EndedJuly 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentService revenue: Americas$7,732 $7,394 $7,150 $338 4.6% $244 3.4%Percentage of service revenue64.4% 64.8% 65.2% EMEA2,623 2,466 2,351 157 6.4% 115 4.9%Percentage of service revenue21.9% 21.6% 21.4% APJC1,638 1,551 1,469 87 5.6% 82 5.6%Percentage of service revenue13.7% 13.6% 13.4% Total$11,993 $11,411 $10,970 $582 5.1% $441 4.0%Fiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015Service revenue grew 5%, which includes a $200 million, or 2%, year-over-year increase as a result of the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016. Service revenue had solid growth across all of our geographic segments. Worldwide technical support services revenue increased by 5% and worldwide advanced services revenue increased by 7%. Technical support services revenue increased across all geographic segments. Renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with product sales provided an installed base of equipment being serviced which, in concert with new service offerings, were the primary factors driving the revenue increases. Advanced services revenue, which relates to professional services for specific customer network needs, grew across all geographic segments.Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014Service revenue increased across all of our geographic segments. Worldwide technical support services revenue increased by 3% and worldwide advanced services revenue increased by 6%, driven by growth in subscription revenues. Technical support services revenue experienced relatively balanced growth across all geographic segments. Renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with product sales provided an installed base of equipment being serviced which, in concert with new service offerings, were the primary factors driving the revenue increases. Advanced services revenue grew across all geographic segments.

The increase in product gross margin was due in large part to productivity improvements, which were driven primarily by value engineering efforts; favorable component pricing; and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations. Value engineering is the process by which production costs are reduced through component redesign, board configuration, test processes, and transformation processes. Our product gross margin also benefited from the sale during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 of our lower margin SP Video CPE Business, lower amortization expense and impairment charges related to acquisition-related intangible assets, and a $188 million charge to product cost of sales recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 related to the Rockstar patent portfolio. The various factors contributing to the product gross margin increase were partially offset by unfavorable impacts from product pricing, which were driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets, an unfavorable mix of products sold and the lower supplier component remediation adjustment. The unfavorable mix of products sold was due to a negative mix impact from our Cisco Unified Computing System products, higher sales of Service Provider Video products (not including the CPE Business) and an unfavorable mix within Switching products.

The increase in product gross margin was due to productivity improvements, which were driven by value engineering efforts; favorable component pricing; continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations and lower warranty expense. The increase was also due to the $655 million charge to product cost of sales in fiscal 2014 related to the expected cost to remediate issues with a supplier component in certain products sold in prior fiscal years and an associated $164 million favorable adjustment recorded in fiscal 2015.51Table of ContentsAdditionally, gross margin increased due to the mix of products sold. The favorable product mix impact was due to revenue decreases from our relatively lower margin Service Provider Video products and a revenue increase from certain of our higher margin core products, partially offset by increased revenue from our relatively lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products. The various factors contributing to the product gross margin increase were partially offset by unfavorable impacts from product pricing, which were driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets, as well as the unfavorable impact of a $188 million charge to product cost of sales recorded in fiscal 2015 related to the Rockstar patent portfolio, see Note 4(b) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Service Gross MarginFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015Service gross margin percentage increased by 1.6 percentage points, as compared with fiscal 2015, due to higher sales volume and decreased headcount-related costs. These benefits to gross margin were partially offset by increased partner delivery costs and increased outside services costs.Our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. Other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services.Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014Service gross margin percentage decreased by 2.0 percentage points for fiscal 2015, as compared with fiscal 2014, driven by increased cost impacts such as partner delivery costs, headcount-related costs and outside services. Headcount-related costs increased due to continued investments in security and cloud managed services and higher variable compensation expense. These cost impacts were partially offset by the resulting benefit to gross margin of higher sales volume in both advanced services and technical support services.Gross Margin by SegmentThe following table presents the total gross margin for each segment (in millions, except percentages): AMOUNT PERCENTAGEYears Ended July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014Gross margin: Americas $19,006 $18,670 $17,379 64.6% 63.0% 62.6%EMEA 7,976 7,705 7,700 64.9% 62.5% 64.1%APJC 4,622 4,307 4,252 61.2% 60.0% 57.8%Segment total 31,604 30,682 29,331 64.2% 62.4% 62.2%Unallocated corporate items (1) (644) (1,001) (1,562) Total $30,960 $29,681 $27,769 62.9% 60.4% 58.9% (1) The unallocated corporate items for the years presented include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant litigation and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges. We do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments. Fiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015The Americas segment experienced a gross margin percentage increase due primarily to the sale of the lower margin SP Video CPE Business. In this geographic segment, productivity improvements were substantially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing and product mix. The unfavorable mix of products sold was due to increased revenue from our lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products and an unfavorable mix within our NGN Routing products. The gross margin percentage increase in our EMEA segment was due primarily to the impact of productivity improvements in this geographic segment and the sale of the SP Video CPE Business. Partially offsetting these favorable impacts to gross margin were negative impacts from pricing and an unfavorable product mix. The unfavorable mix of products sold was due primarily to increased revenue from our lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products. Higher service gross margin also contributed to the increase in the overall gross margin in this geographic segment.52Table of ContentsOur APJC segment gross margin percentage increased due to productivity improvements, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing and mix. The mix impact was driven primarily by higher sales from our Service Provider Video products (not including the SP Video CPE Business) and unfavorable mix within our NGN Routing products.The gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment. Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014We experienced a gross margin percentage increase in our Americas segment due to productivity improvements partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing. The product mix was flat in this geographic segment as the impact of decreased revenue from our relatively lower margin Service Provider Video products offset the increase in revenue from our relatively lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products. The gross margin percentage decrease in our EMEA segment was due primarily to unfavorable impacts from pricing and mix. The unfavorable mix impact was driven by an increase in revenue from our relatively lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products. Lower service gross margin also contributed to the decrease in the overall gross margin in this segment.The APJC segment gross margin percentage increased due to productivity improvements and a favorable mix impact, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing. The favorable mix impact was driven by a decrease in revenue from our relatively lower margin Service Provider Video products and an increase in revenue from certain of our higher margin core products. Research and Development (“R&D”), Sales and Marketing, and General and Administrative (“G&A”) ExpensesR&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses are summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentResearch and development $6,296 $6,207 $6,294 $89 1.4 % $(87) (1.4)%Percentage of revenue 12.8% 12.6% 13.4% Sales and marketing 9,619 9,821 9,503 (202) (2.1)% 318 3.3 %Percentage of revenue 19.5% 20.0% 20.2% General and administrative 1,814 2,040 1,934 (226) (11.1)% 106 5.5 %Percentage of revenue 3.7% 4.1% 4.1% Total $17,729 $18,068 $17,731 $(339) (1.9)% $337 1.9 %Percentage of revenue 36.0% 36.8% 37.6% Fiscal 2016 had an extra week compared with fiscal 2015. We estimate that the extra week contributed approximately $116 million in total operating expenses (not including share-based compensation expense discussed below).R&D ExpensesFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015R&D expenses increased for fiscal 2016, as compared with fiscal 2015, primarily due to higher headcount-related expenses attributable in part to the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 and, to a lesser extent, higher share-based compensation expense. These increases were partially offset by lower acquisition-related costs and lower discretionary spending.We continue to invest in R&D in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. If we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal R&D.Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014The decrease in R&D expenses for fiscal 2015, as compared with fiscal 2014, was primarily due to higher compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2014 in connection with our acquisition of the remaining interest in Insieme Networks, Inc. (“Insieme”). See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Efficiencies arising from our restructuring action announced in August 2014 also contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by higher contracted services and higher share-based compensation expense. 53Table of ContentsSales and Marketing ExpensesFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015Sales and marketing expenses decreased for fiscal 2016, as compared with fiscal 2015, due to lower discretionary spending and lower headcount-related expenses. The aforementioned items benefited from foreign exchange rates during fiscal 2016. Lower share-based compensation expense also contributed to the decrease. Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014Sales and marketing expenses increased for fiscal 2015, as compared with fiscal 2014, due to higher headcount-related expenses, driven by increased variable compensation expense and higher discretionary spending, partially offset by lower compensation expense from acquisitions. G&A ExpensesFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015G&A expenses decreased in fiscal 2016, as compared with fiscal 2015, primarily due to the $253 million pre-tax gain from the sale of our SP Video CPE Business and, to a lesser extent, lower contracted services and lower share-based compensation expense, partially offset by higher headcount-related expenses. The extra week in fiscal 2016 contributed to the increased headcount-related expenses.Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014G&A expenses increased in fiscal 2015, as compared with fiscal 2014, primarily due to increased variable compensation expense as a result of our financial performance, higher share-based compensation expense and the timing of corporate-level expenses. Corporate-level expenses, which tend to vary from period to period, included operational infrastructure activities such as IT project implementations, which included investments in our global data center infrastructure, and investments related to operational and financial systems.Effect of Foreign CurrencyIn fiscal 2016, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $567 million, or 3.1%, compared with fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2015, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $278 million, or 1.6%, compared with fiscal 2014. HeadcountFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015Our headcount increased by approximately 1,800 employees in fiscal 2016 due to headcount additions from targeted hiring in key growth areas in engineering and services, and due also to headcount additions from our recent acquisitions. These headcount additions were partially offset by headcount reductions from our restructuring plan announced in August 2014 and from the sale of the SP Video CPE Business.Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014The decrease in headcount of approximately 2,200 employees in fiscal 2015 was due to headcount reductions from attrition and from our restructuring plan announced in August 2014. These headcount reductions were partially offset by headcount additions from targeted hiring in engineering and services, and also by headcount additions from our recent acquisitions. 54Table of ContentsShare-Based Compensation ExpenseThe following table presents share-based compensation expense (in millions):Years Ended July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014Cost of sales—product $70 $50 $45Cost of sales—service 142 157 150Share-based compensation expense in cost of sales 212 207 195Research and development 470 448 411Sales and marketing 545 559 549General and administrative 205 228 198Restructuring and other charges 26 (2) (5)Share-based compensation expense in operating expenses 1,246 1,233 1,153Total share-based compensation expense $1,458 $1,440 $1,348The increase in share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2016, as compared with fiscal 2015, was due primarily to the timing of RSU grants and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016, partially offset by lower net expense associated with accelerated and modified awards. The increase in share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2015, as compared with fiscal 2014, was due primarily to higher expense associated with performance-based restricted stock units and charges associated with severance arrangements with certain executives, partially offset by lower expense related to equity awards assumed with respect to our recent acquisitions. Amortization of Purchased Intangible AssetsThe following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets (in millions):Years Ended July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014Amortization of purchased intangible assets: Cost of sales $577 $814 $742Operating expenses 303 359 275Total $880 $1,173 $1,017Amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased in fiscal 2016, as compared with fiscal 2015, due to certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized or impaired, partially offset by amortization of purchased intangible assets from our recent acquisitions. Lower impairment charges in fiscal 2016 also contributed to the decrease.Amortization of purchased intangible assets increased in fiscal 2015 as compared with fiscal 2014, primarily due to the impairment charges of approximately $175 million recorded in fiscal 2015. The impairment charges were primarily due to declines in estimated fair value resulting from reductions in or the elimination of expected future cash flows associated with certain of our technology and IPR&D intangible assets. Restructuring and Other ChargesIn connection with a restructuring action announced in August 2014, we incurred restructuring and other charges of $267 million and $489 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. These charges were related primarily to severance and other one-time termination benefits and other associated costs. We completed this plan at the end of fiscal 2016. In connection with a restructuring action announced in August 2013, we incurred restructuring and other charges of approximately $418 million during fiscal 2014, which were related primarily to employee severance charges for employees impacted by our workforce reduction under this plan. We completed this plan at the end of fiscal 2014. In August 2016, we announced a restructuring plan that will impact up to 5,500 employees, representing approximately 7% of our global workforce. We began taking action under this plan in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We currently estimate that we will recognize pre-tax charges in an amount of up to $700 million consisting of severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other associated costs. We expect that approximately $325 million to $400 million of these charges will be recognized during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, with the remaining amount to be recognized during the rest of the fiscal 2017. We expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from the restructuring actions in our key priority areas such as security, IoT, collaboration, next generation data center and cloud. As a result, the overall cost savings from these restructuring actions are not expected to be material for future periods.55Table of ContentsOperating IncomeThe following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014Operating income $12,660 $10,770 $9,345Operating income as a percentage of revenue 25.7% 21.9% 19.8%For fiscal 2016, as compared with fiscal 2015, operating income increased by 18%, and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 3.8 percentage points. The increase resulted from the following: a gross margin percentage increase, driven in part by the sale of the lower margin SP Video CPE Business during fiscal 2016; the $253 million pre-tax gain from the sale of our SP Video CPE Business; and a decrease in restructuring and other charges related to the restructuring action announced in August 2014. For fiscal 2015, as compared with fiscal 2014, operating income increased by 15%, and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 2.1 percentage points. The increase resulted from the following: an increase in revenue; a gross margin percentage increase, driven in part by the $655 million supplier component remediation charge (or 1.4 percentage points of fiscal 2014 revenue) recorded in fiscal 2014; and higher compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2014 in connection with our acquisition of the remaining interest in Insieme.Interest and Other Income (Loss), NetInterest Income (Expense), Net The following table summarizes interest income and interest expense (in millions): Years Ended 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 Variance in Dollars Variance in DollarsInterest income$1,005 $769 $691 $236 $78Interest expense(676) (566) (564) (110) (2)Interest income (expense), net$329 $203 $127 $126 $76Fiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015Interest income increased in fiscal 2016 as compared with fiscal 2015, driven by an increase in our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and fixed income investments as well as higher yields on our portfolio of cash and investments. The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 was driven by higher average debt balances and the impact of higher effective interest rates on floating-rate senior notes and interest rate swaps associated with fixed-rate senior notes. Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014Interest income increased in fiscal 2015 as compared with fiscal 2014, driven by an increase in our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and fixed income investments. Interest expense in fiscal 2015 as compared with the prior fiscal year increased slightly, driven by additional interest expense due to the net increase in long-term debt in fiscal 2015. Other Income (Loss), Net The components of other income (loss), net, are summarized as follows (in millions): Years Ended 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014 Variance in Dollars Variance in DollarsGains (losses) on investments, net: Publicly traded equity securities$33 $116 $253 $(83) $(137)Fixed income securities(34) 41 47 (75) (6)Total available-for-sale investments(1) 157 300 (158) (143)Privately held companies(35) 82 (60) (117) 142Net gains (losses) on investments(36) 239 240 (275) (1)Other gains (losses), net(33) (11) 3 (22) (14)Other income (loss), net$(69) $228 $243 $(297) $(15)56Table of ContentsFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015The change in total net gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments in fiscal 2016, as compared with fiscal 2015, was primarily attributable to lower realized gains on publicly traded equity securities and net losses on fixed income securities in fiscal 2016 compared to net gains in fiscal 2015 as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities. The change in net gains (losses) on investments in privately held companies in fiscal 2016, as compared with fiscal 2015, was primarily due to a gain of $126 million related to the reorganization of our investment in VCE, which was recorded in fiscal 2015. The change in other gains (losses), net in fiscal 2016, as compared with fiscal 2015, was driven by higher donation expenses and net unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by higher gains from customer lease terminations.Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014The decrease in total net gains on available-for-sale investments in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily attributable to lower gains on publicly traded equity securities in the current period as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities. The change in net gains (losses) on investments in privately held companies for the fiscal 2015 as compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily due to a $126 million gain recorded in fiscal 2015 related to the reorganization of our investments in VCE and lower losses related to this investment under the equity method. We ceased accounting for VCE under the equity method in October 2014. These favorable items were partially offset by higher impairment charges and lower realized gains from sales of various investments in privately held companies. The change in other gains (losses), net in fiscal 2015 as compared with fiscal 2014 was driven by equity derivative impacts and higher donation expenses, partially offset by net favorable foreign exchange impacts in fiscal 2015.Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates, higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates, and expiration of or lapses in tax incentives. Our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries. If these earnings were distributed from the foreign subsidiaries to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes.Fiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 16.9% for fiscal 2016, compared with 19.8% for fiscal 2015. The net 2.9 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rates between fiscal years was primarily due to a non-recurring net tax benefit of $367 million, or 2.8 percentage points, related to a tax settlement with the IRS in fiscal 2016. For a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Fiscal 2015 Compared with Fiscal 2014The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 19.8% for fiscal 2015, compared with 19.2% for fiscal 2014. The net 0.6 percentage point increase in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was primarily due to a decrease in foreign income taxed at lower than U.S. rates, partially offset by an increase in U.S. federal R&D tax credit.57Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowsCash and Cash Equivalents and Investments The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments (in millions): July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 Increase (Decrease)Cash and cash equivalents$7,631 $6,877 $754Fixed income securities56,621 51,974 4,647Publicly traded equity securities1,504 1,565 (61)Total$65,756 $60,416 $5,340The net increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of cash provided by operating activities of $13.6 billion, a net increase in debt of $3.1 billion, proceeds from issuance of common stock of $1.1 billion pursuant to employee stock incentive and purchase plans, and net proceeds from the sale of our SP Video CPE Business of $0.4 billion. These sources of cash were partially offset by cash returned to shareholders in the form of cash dividends of $4.8 billion and repurchase of common stock of $3.9 billion under the stock repurchase program, net cash paid for acquisitions of $3.2 billion and capital expenditures of $1.1 billion. Our total in cash and cash equivalents and investments held by various foreign subsidiaries was $59.8 billion and $53.4 billion as of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015, respectively. Under current tax laws and regulations, if these assets were to be distributed from the foreign subsidiaries to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. The balance of cash and cash equivalents and investments available in the United States as of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015 was $5.9 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively. We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our fixed income investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below.Free Cash Flow and Capital Allocation As part of our capital allocation strategy, we intend to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment. The following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions):Years EndedJuly 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 July 26, 2014Net cash provided by operating activities$13,570 $12,552 $12,332Acquisition of property and equipment(1,146) (1,227) (1,275)Free cash flow$12,424 $11,325 $11,057We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue, excess tax benefits resulting from share-based compensation, and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. For additional discussion, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report.We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, we have other required uses of cash, including 58Table of Contentsrepaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net income provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do.

Our DSO as of July 30, 2016 was higher by four days as compared with the end of fiscal 2015, as there was a relatively higher proportion of service billings in the latter part of the fourth quarter in fiscal 2016.Inventory Supply Chain The following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in millions, except annualized inventory turns): July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 Increase (Decrease)Inventories$1,217 $1,627 $(410)Annualized inventory turns14.6 12.1 2.5Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers$3,896 $4,078 $(182)Inventory as of July 30, 2016 decreased by 25% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2015, and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by approximately 4%. On a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by 10% compared with the end of fiscal 2015. The decrease in inventory and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was due in part to the sale of the SP Video CPE Business. We believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts.Our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods. Distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers. Manufactured finished goods consist primarily of build-to-order and build-to-stock products.We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity.Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels.59Table of ContentsFinancing Receivables and Guarantees We measure our net balance sheet exposure position related to our financing receivables and financing guarantees by reducing the total of gross financing receivables and financing guarantees by the associated allowances for credit loss and deferred revenue. As of July 30, 2016, our net balance sheet exposure position related to financing receivables and financing guarantees was as follows (in millions): FINANCING RECEIVABLES FINANCING GUARANTEES July 30, 2016LeaseReceivables LoanReceivables Financed ServiceContracts and Other Total Channel Partner End-User Customers Total TOTALFinancing receivables and guarantees$3,474 $2,135 $3,370 $8,979 $281 $96 $377 $9,356Unearned income(174) — — (174) — — — (174)Allowance for credit loss(230) (97) (48) (375) — — — (375)Deferred revenue(6) (15) (1,716) (1,737) (85) (76) (161) (1,898)Net balance sheet exposure$3,064 $2,023 $1,606 $6,693 $196 $20 $216 $6,909Financing Receivables Financing receivables less unearned income increased by 1% compared with the end of fiscal 2015. The change was primarily due to a 21% increase in loan receivables partially offset by a 6% decrease in financed service contracts and other and a 3% decrease in lease receivables. We provide financing to certain end-user customers and channel partners to enable sales of our products, services, and networking solutions. These financing arrangements include leases, financed service contracts, and loans. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases. We also provide certain qualified customers financing for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services. Our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term.Financing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. The volume of channel partner financing was $26.9 billion, $25.9 billion, and $24.6 billion in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion as of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015, respectively. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. Deferred Revenue Related to Financing Receivables and Guarantees The majority of the deferred revenue in the preceding table is related to financed service contracts. The majority of the revenue related to financed service contracts, which primarily relates to technical support services, is deferred as the revenue related to financed service contracts is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed. A portion of the revenue related to lease and loan receivables is also deferred and included in deferred product revenue based on revenue recognition criteria not currently having been met.60Table of ContentsBorrowingsSenior Notes The following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes (in millions): Maturity Date July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 Senior notes: Floating-rate notes: Three-month LIBOR plus 0.05%September 3, 2015 $— $850 Three-month LIBOR plus 0.28%March 3, 2017 1,000 1,000 Three-month LIBOR plus 0.60%February 21, 2018(1)1,000 — Three-month LIBOR plus 0.31%June 15, 2018 900 900 Three-month LIBOR plus 0.50%March 1, 2019 500 500 Fixed-rate notes: 5.50%February 22, 2016 — 3,000 1.10%March 3, 2017 2,400 2,400 3.15%March 14, 2017 750 750 1.40%February 28, 2018(1)1,250 — 1.65%June 15, 2018 1,600 1,600 4.95%February 15, 2019 2,000 2,000 1.60%February 28, 2019(1)1,000 — 2.125%March 1, 2019 1,750 1,750 4.45%January 15, 2020 2,500 2,500 2.45%June 15, 2020 1,500 1,500 2.20%February 28, 2021(1)2,500 — 2.90%March 4, 2021 500 500 3.00%June 15, 2022 500 500 2.60%February 28, 2023(1)500 — 3.625%March 4, 2024 1,000 1,000 3.50%June 15, 2025 500 500 2.95%February 28, 2026(1)750 — 5.90%February 15, 2039 2,000 2,000 5.50%January 15, 2040 2,000 2,000 Total $28,400 $25,250 (1) In February 2016, we issued senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $7.0 billion.Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable quarterly on the floating-rate notes. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of July 30, 2016.We repaid the fixed-rate notes (5.50%) due on February 22, 2016 for an aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion upon maturity.We repaid the floating-rate notes due on September 3, 2015 for an aggregate principal amount of $850 million upon maturity.Other Debt Other debt as of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015 includes secured borrowings associated with customer financing arrangements. The amount of borrowings outstanding under these arrangements was $1 million and $4 million as of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015, respectively.Commercial Paper We established a short-term debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper notes. We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper notes outstanding as of each of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015.Credit Facility On May 15, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on May 15, 2020. Any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the highest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time, or (c) LIBOR, or a comparable or successor rate that is approved by the Administrative Agent (“Eurocurrency Rate”), for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, or (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate, plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor’s Financial 61Table of ContentsServices, LLC and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., provided that in no event will the Eurocurrency Rate be less than zero. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that it maintains an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement. We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and/or extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to May 15, 2022. We were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility. Deferred Revenue The following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue (in millions): July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 Increase (Decrease)Service$10,621 $9,757 $864Product5,851 5,426 425 Total$16,472 $15,183 $1,289Reported as: Current$10,155 $9,824 $331Noncurrent6,317 5,359 958 Total$16,472 $15,183 $1,289Total deferred revenue increased 8% in fiscal 2016. Deferred service revenue increased 9% driven by the timing of multiyear arrangements, an increase in customers paying technical support service contracts over time and the impact of ongoing amortization of deferred service revenue. Deferred product revenue increased 8% primarily due to increased deferrals related to subscription and software revenue arrangements, partially offset by lower deferred revenue related to two-tier distributors. The product categories of Collaboration, Security, and Wireless were the key contributors to the increase in deferred product revenue. The portion of deferred product revenue related to recurring software and subscriptions increased 33% including the portion related to our Security products which increased 29% and our Collaboration products which increased 13%.Contractual ObligationsThe impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. In addition, we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at July 30, 2016 (in millions): PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIODJuly 30, 2016Total Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 YearsOperating leases$1,159 $363 $446 $190 $160Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers3,896 3,896 — — —Other purchase obligations2,010 726 712 523 49Senior notes28,400 4,150 10,000 7,000 7,250Other long-term liabilities1,153 — 182 127 844Total by period$36,618 $9,135 $11,340 $7,840 $8,303Other long-term liabilities (uncertainty in the timing of future payments)1,203 Total$37,821 Operating Leases For more information on our operating leases, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. A significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in “Inventory Supply Chain.” As of July 30, 2016, the liability for these purchase commitments was $159 million and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table.62Table of ContentsOther Purchase Obligations Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations. Long-Term Debt The amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, noncurrent deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $925 million and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of $278 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).Other CommitmentsIn connection with our business combinations and asset purchases, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Insieme Networks, Inc. In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we made an investment in Insieme, an early stage company focused on research and development in the data center market. As set forth in the agreement between Cisco and Insieme, this investment included $100 million of funding and a license to certain of our technology. Immediately prior to the call option exercise and acquisition described below, we owned approximately 83% of Insieme as a result of these investments and have consolidated the results of Insieme in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with this investment, we entered into a put/call option agreement that provided us with the right to purchase the remaining interests in Insieme. In addition, the noncontrolling interest holders could require us to purchase their shares upon the occurrence of certain events. During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we exercised our call option and entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining interests in Insieme. The acquisition closed in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, at which time the former noncontrolling interest holders became eligible to receive up to two milestone payments, which will be determined using agreed-upon formulas based primarily on revenue for certain of Insieme’s products. During fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, we recorded compensation expense of $160 million, $207 million and $416 million, respectively, related to the fair value of the vested portion of amounts that were earned or expected to be earned by the former noncontrolling interest holders. Continued vesting will result in additional compensation expense in future periods. Based on the terms of the agreement, we have determined that the maximum amount that could be recorded as compensation expense by us is approximately $836 million (which includes the $783 million that has been expensed to date), net of forfeitures. The former noncontrolling interest holders earned the maximum amount related to the first milestone payment and were paid approximately $389 million for a portion of this amount during fiscal 2016. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect to pay approximately $325 million pursuant to the second milestone payment and continued vesting of the first milestone payment.Other Funding Commitments We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $222 million as of July 30, 2016, compared with $205 million as of July 25, 2015.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements. In the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers. These privately held companies and customers may be considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings, and we have determined that as of July 30, 2016 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities.On an ongoing basis, we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing Receivables and Guarantees.”63Table of ContentsSecurities LendingWe periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale investments. These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. The average daily balance of securities lending for fiscal 2016 and 2015 was $1.0 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. As of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015, we had no outstanding securities lending transactions. We believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements. Liquidity and Capital Resource RequirementsBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources. Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskOur financial position is exposed to a variety of risks, including interest rate risk, equity price risk, and foreign currency exchange risk.Interest Rate RiskFixed Income Securities We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk. At any time, a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates, including the impact from lower credit spreads, could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives. We had no outstanding hedging instruments for our fixed income securities as of July 30, 2016. Our fixed income investments are held for purposes other than trading. Our fixed income investments are not leveraged as of July 30, 2016. We monitor our interest rate and credit risks, including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong. The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our fixed income securities, including the hedging effects when applicable, as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates. The market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (“BPS”), plus 100 BPS, and plus 150 BPS. Due to the low interest rate environment at the end of each of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, we did not believe a parallel shift of minus 100 BPS or minus 150 BPS was relevant. The hypothetical fair values as of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015 are as follows (in millions): VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTS FAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 30, 2016 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPSFixed income securitiesN/A N/A $57,074 $56,621 $56,168 $55,715 $55,262 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTS FAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 25, 2015 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPSFixed income securitiesN/A N/A $52,366 $51,974 $51,582 $51,189 $50,79764Table of ContentsFinancing Receivables As of July 30, 2016, our financing receivables had a carrying value of $8.4 billion, compared with $8.3 billion as of July 25, 2015. As of July 30, 2016, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.1 billion, respectively. Debt As of July 30, 2016, we had $28.4 billion in principal amount of senior notes outstanding, which consisted of $3.4 billion floating-rate notes and $25.0 billion fixed-rate notes. The carrying amount of the senior notes was $28.6 billion, and the related fair value based on market prices was $30.9 billion. As of July 30, 2016, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed-rate debt, excluding the $9.9 billion of hedged debt, by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.6 billion, respectively. However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed-rate debt that is not hedged.Equity Price RiskThe fair value of our equity investments in publicly traded companies is subject to market price volatility. We may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio. Our equity portfolio consists of securities with characteristics that most closely match the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index or NASDAQ Composite Index. These equity securities are held for purposes other than trading. To manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain equity securities, we may enter into equity derivatives designated as hedging instruments.Publicly Traded Equity Securities The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of publicly traded equity securities as a result of selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each equity security in the portfolio, excluding hedged equity securities, if any. Potential fluctuations in the price of each equity security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 20%, and 30% were selected based on potential near-term changes in those security prices. The hypothetical fair values as of July 30, 2016 and July 25, 2015 are as follows (in millions): VALUATION OFSECURITIESGIVEN AN X%DECREASE INEACH STOCK’S PRICE FAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 30, 2016 VALUATION OFSECURITIESGIVEN AN X%INCREASE INEACH STOCK’S PRICE (30)% (20)% (10)% 10% 20% 30%Publicly traded equity securities$1,053 $1,203 $1,354 $1,504 $1,654 $1,805 $1,955 VALUATION OFSECURITIESGIVEN AN X%DECREASE INEACH STOCK’S PRICE FAIR VALUE AS OF JULY 25, 2015 VALUATION OFSECURITIESGIVEN AN X%INCREASE INEACH STOCK’S PRICE (30)% (20)% (10)% 10% 20% 30%Publicly traded equity securities$1,096 $1,252 $1,409 $1,565 $1,722 $1,878 $2,035Investments in Privately Held Companies We have also invested in privately held companies. These investments are recorded in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are accounted for using primarily either the cost or the equity method. As of July 30, 2016, the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was $1,003 million, compared with $897 million at July 25, 2015. Some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including, among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return. 65Table of ContentsForeign Currency Exchange RiskOur foreign exchange forward and option contracts outstanding at fiscal year-end are summarized in U.S. dollar equivalents as follows (in millions): July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair ValueForward contracts: Purchased$3,079 $(41) $1,988 $(5)Sold$651 $— $614 $2Option contracts: Purchased$688 $4 $422 $6Sold$620 $(10) $392 $(3)We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, as was the case during fiscal 2016, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations.Approximately 70% of our operating expenses are U.S.-dollar denominated. In fiscal 2016, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased our combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $567 million, or 3.1%, as compared with fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2015, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased our combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $278 million, or 1.6%, as compared with fiscal 2014. To reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by non-U.S.-dollar denominated operating expenses and costs, we hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts. These hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons. In designing a specific hedging approach, we consider several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of exposures, costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument, and potential effectiveness of the hedge. The gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales.We also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities. The market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables, investments, and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances. We do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for speculative purposes.66Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:09:30.310440

As a result, revenue from this portion of the Service Provider Video product category will not recur in future periods. The year ended July 30, 2016 included SP Video CPE Business revenue of $504 million. 35Table of ContentsFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016—Financial PerformanceIn fiscal 2017 we delivered solid profitability and strong operating cash flows. We remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we believe that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities. We continue to operate in a challenging and highly competitive environment, which has impacted, in particular, our NGN Routing and Switching areas. We saw weakness in the service provider customer market and we expect ongoing uncertainty in that area. In addition, we continued to see weakness in emerging countries in the aggregate. We experienced solid revenue growth in Security and Wireless, and we continued to make progress in the transition of our business model to increased software and subscriptions which is part of our strategy. While the overall environment remains uncertain, we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas to drive profitable growth over the long term. Total revenue decreased by 3% compared with fiscal 2016. Within total revenue, product revenue decreased 4% while service revenue increased by 3%. In the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed the sale of our SP Video CPE Business. Total company revenue for fiscal 2017 decreased 2% not including revenue from SP Video CPE products for fiscal 2016. Additionally, fiscal 2017 had 52 weeks, compared with 53 weeks in fiscal 2016, thus our results for fiscal 2017 reflect one less week compared with fiscal 2016. We estimate that the additional revenue associated with the extra week was approximately $265 million. Total gross margin increased by 0.1 percentage points. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, decreased by 0.1 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 0.8 percentage points, driven primarily by an increase in restructuring and other charges related to the restructuring action announced in August 2016. Diluted earnings per share decreased by 10%, driven by an 11% decrease in net income. Net income was impacted by a higher effective tax rate, as compared with fiscal 2016, primarily due to the recognition of $448 million of net benefits to the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2016. These benefits were comprised of a settlement with the IRS of outstanding items related to the audit of our federal income tax returns covering the period from fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010 and the permanent reinstatement of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit. In terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the Americas decreased $1.0 billion, driven in large part by lower product revenue in the Unites States. EMEA revenue decreased by $0.3 billion, led by a product revenue decline in the United Kingdom. Revenue in our APJC segment increased by $0.1 billion, led by service revenue growth in this segment. We saw revenue declines in many emerging countries across the world during fiscal 2017. The “BRICM” countries experienced a product revenue decline of 7% in the aggregate, driven by declines in the emerging countries of Mexico, China and Brazil of 28%, 12% and 7%, respectively, partially offset by increased product revenue in Russia and India of 20% and 11%, respectively.From a customer market standpoint, we experienced product revenue declines in the service provider and the public sector markets and, to a lesser extent, in the commercial market. Product revenue in the enterprise market was flat. The decline in the service provider market was driven in part by the sale of the SP Video CPE Business as well as ongoing weakness in the service provider market. From a product category perspective, total company product revenue decreased 4%. This decrease was led by product revenue decreases in Switching and NGN Routing of 5% and 4%, respectively. The decline in sales of our Switching products was primarily due to lower sales of switches used in campus environments, which comprise the majority of our Switching portfolio. We believe the decline in sales of Switching products used in campus environments was driven both by uncertainty in the macro environment, which led to a slowdown in customer spending, as well as by a highly competitive landscape. Product revenue from Service Provider Video, Data Center and Collaboration decreased by 45%, 4% and 2%, respectively. Partially offsetting these decreases was product revenue growth in Security and Wireless, which grew by 9% and 5%, respectively.36Table of ContentsFourth Quarter SnapshotFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, total revenue decreased by 4%. Within the total revenue, product revenue decreased 5% while service revenue increased by 1%. With regard to our geographic segment performance, on a year-over-year basis, revenue in the Americas and EMEA each decreased by 6%, while APJC had revenue growth of 6%. From a product category perspective, total product revenue decrease was driven by revenue decreases from Switching and NGN Routing products, with each decreasing 9% year over year. Total gross margin decreased by 0.9 percentage points. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively decreased by 0.7 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 1.1 percentage points. Diluted earnings per share decreased by 14% from the prior year, primarily as a result of a 14% decrease in net income.

Business.Other Key Financial MeasuresThe following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 (in millions, except annualized inventory turns): Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016Cash and cash equivalents and investments $70,492 $65,756Cash provided by operating activities $13,876 $13,570Deferred revenue $18,494 $16,472Repurchases of common stock—stock repurchase program $3,706 $3,918Dividends $5,511 $4,750Inventories $1,616 $1,217Annualized inventory turns 12.3 14.637Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met:•Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Contracts, Internet commerce agreements, and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.•Delivery has occurred. Shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery. For software, delivery is considered to have occurred upon unrestricted license access and license term commencement, when applicable.•The fee is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.•Collectibility is reasonably assured. We assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer’s payment history.In instances where final acceptance of the product, system, or solution is specified by the customer, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. When a sale involves multiple deliverables, such as sales of products that include services, the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting, and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price. Revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met. For hosting arrangements, we recognize revenue ratably over the hosting period, while usage revenue is recognized based on utilization. Software subscription revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription term upon delivery of the first product and commencement of the term. The amount of revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and, if so, our valuation of the units of accounting. Our multiple element arrangements may contain only deliverables within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605, Revenue Recognition, deliverables within the scope of ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition, or a combination of both. According to the accounting guidance prescribed in ASC 605, we use vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE) for each of those units, when available. We determine VSOE based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the historical standalone transactions have the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range, generally evidenced by approximately 80% of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus 15% of the median rates. When VSOE does not exist, we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multiple-deliverable arrangements. Under the selling price hierarchy, third-party evidence of selling price (TPE) will be considered if VSOE does not exist, and estimated selling price (ESP) will be used if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Generally, we are not able to determine TPE because our go-to-market strategy differs from that of others in our markets, and the extent of our proprietary technology varies among comparable products or services from those of our peers. In determining ESP, we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors, based on the characteristics of the deliverable. We typically arrive at an ESP for a product or service that is not sold separately by considering company-specific factors such as geographies, competitive landscape, internal costs, profitability objectives, pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing, and existing portfolio pricing and discounting. As our business and offerings evolve over time, our pricing practices may be required to be modified accordingly, which could result in changes in selling prices, including both VSOE and ESP, in subsequent periods. There were no material impacts during fiscal 2017, nor do we currently expect a material impact in the next 12 months on our revenue recognition due to any changes in our VSOE, TPE, or ESP. We make sales to distributors which we refer to as two-tier sales to the end customer. Revenue from two-tier distributors is recognized based on a sell-through method using point-of-sale information provided by these distributors. Distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other incentive programs, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs. If actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.38Table of ContentsAllowances for Receivables and Sales ReturnsThe allowances for receivables were as follows (in millions, except percentages): July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016Allowance for doubtful accounts $211 $249Percentage of gross accounts receivable 3.9% 4.1%Allowance for credit loss—lease receivables $162 $230Percentage of gross lease receivables (1) 5.5% 6.6%Allowance for credit loss—loan receivables $103 $97Percentage of gross loan receivables 2.3% 2.8%(1) Calculated as allowance for credit loss on lease receivables as a percentage of gross lease receivables and residual value before unearned income.The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience, credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay as well as historical and expected default frequency rates, which are published by major third-party credit-rating agencies and are updated on a quarterly basis. We also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts. If a major customer’s creditworthiness deteriorates, if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, or if other circumstances arise, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, and additional allowances could be required, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.The allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis. When evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis, we consider historical experience, credit quality and age of receivable balances, and economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. When evaluating financing receivables on a collective basis, we use expected default frequency rates published by a major third-party credit-rating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default, while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions, concentration of risk and correlation. Determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings, as well as assessing factors such as economic conditions, concentration of risk, and correlation, are complex and subjective. Our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results. Both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible.A reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. The reserve for future sales returns as of July 29, 2017 and July 30, 2016 was $122 million and $126 million, respectively, and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue. If the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established, our revenue could be adversely affected. Inventory Valuation and Liability for Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and SuppliersInventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories, determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of our cost of sales. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. As of July 29, 2017, the liability for these purchase commitments was $162 million, compared with $159 million as of July 30, 2016, and was included in other current liabilities.Our provision for inventory was $74 million, $65 million, and $54 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was $124 million, $134 million, and $102 million in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we could be required to increase our inventory write-downs, and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and accordingly our profitability, could be adversely affected. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments.39Table of ContentsInventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence, particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainties and conditions and the resulting potential for changes in future demand forecast. Loss Contingencies and Product WarrantiesWe are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.In fiscal 2014, we recorded a charge to product cost of sales of $655 million resulting from failures related to products containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010. We perform regular assessments of the sufficiency of this liability and reduced the amount by $74 million and $164 million in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively based on updated analyses. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we further reduced the liability by $141 million to reflect lower than expected defects, actual usage history, and estimated lower future remediation costs as more of the impacted products age and near the end of the support period covered by the remediation program. In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we recorded a $125 million charge to product cost of sales related to the expected remediation costs for anticipated failures in future periods of a widely-used component sourced from a third party which is included in several of our products. The liabilities related to the supplier component remediation matters as of July 29, 2017 and July 30, 2016 was $174 million and $276 million, respectively.Estimating these liabilities is complex and subjective, and if we experience changes in a number of underlying assumptions and estimates such as a change in claims compared with our expectations, or if the cost of servicing these claims is different than expected, our estimated liabilities for these matters may be impacted.Our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years, and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty. We accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs, technical support labor costs, and associated overhead. Material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment. Technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period. Overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities.If we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected, our profitability could be adversely affected.Fair Value MeasurementsOur fixed income and publicly traded equity securities, collectively, are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at a fair value of $58.8 billion as of July 29, 2017, compared with $58.1 billion as of July 30, 2016. Our fixed income investment portfolio, as of July 29, 2017, consisted primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.As described more fully in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a valuation hierarchy is based on the level of independent, objective evidence available regarding the value of the investments. It encompasses three classes of investments: Level 1 consists of securities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical securities; Level 2 consists of securities for which observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs are used, such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets and model-derived valuations for which the variables are derived from, or corroborated by, observable market data; and Level 3 consists of securities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value.40Table of ContentsOur Level 2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. We use inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from independent pricing vendors, quoted market prices, or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities. We use such pricing data as the primary input, to which we have not made any material adjustments during fiscal 2017 and 2016, to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio. We are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates.The inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness, may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information, and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to its estimate of fair value. The assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective. However, given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio, and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets, we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of subjectivity and judgment was material to the valuation of the investment portfolio as of July 29, 2017. Level 3 assets do not represent a significant portion of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of July 29, 2017 and July 30, 2016.Other-than-Temporary Impairments We recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary. The ultimate value realized on these securities, to the extent unhedged, is subject to market price volatility until they are sold.If the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary. An impairment is considered other than temporary if (i) we have the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on (i) or (ii) described in the prior sentence, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (iii), the amount representing credit loss, defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security, will be recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). In estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected, we consider all available information, including past events, current conditions, the remaining payment terms of the security, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults, and the value of underlying collateral.For publicly traded equity securities, we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.We also have investments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages. As of July 29, 2017, our investments in privately held companies were $983 million, compared with $1,003 million as of July 30, 2016, and were included in other assets. We monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment, and we make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required, based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize.Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Asset ImpairmentsOur methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.The goodwill recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 29, 2017 and July 30, 2016 was $29.8 billion and $26.6 billion, respectively. The increase in goodwill during fiscal 2017 was due in large part to our acquisition of AppDynamics. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015. For the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2017, the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was $46.8 billion for the Americas, $25.1 billion for EMEA, and $20.9 billion for APJC. 41Table of ContentsDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. The fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. We consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were $47 million, $74 million, and $175 million during fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R&D tax credits, domestic manufacturing deductions, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, international realignments, and transfer pricing adjustments. Our effective tax rate was 21.8%, 16.9%, and 19.8% in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany R&D cost-sharing arrangement and legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including possible changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 35 countries, including the United States, has recently made changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. As a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.

Our revenue, which includes product and service for each segment, is summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentRevenue: Americas $28,351 $29,392 $29,626 $(1,041) (3.5)% $(234) (0.8)%Percentage of revenue 59.1% 59.7% 60.3% EMEA 12,004 12,302 12,348 (298) (2.4)% (46) (0.4)%Percentage of revenue 25.0% 25.0% 25.1% APJC 7,650 7,553 7,187 97 1.3 % 366 5.1 %Percentage of revenue 15.9% 15.3% 14.6% Total $48,005 $49,247 $49,161 $(1,242) (2.5)% $86 0.2 %Fiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016 Total revenue decreased by 3%. Total company revenue not including SP Video CPE products decreased 2%. Product revenue decreased by 4% while service revenue increased by 3%. Fiscal 2017 had 52 weeks, compared with 53 weeks in fiscal 2016, thus our results for fiscal 2017 reflect one less extra week. We estimate that the additional revenue associated with the extra week was approximately $265 million, $200 million of which was from our services subscriptions, and $65 million from our SaaS offerings such as WebEx, and a small amount from product distribution. Our total revenue declined in the Americas and EMEA geographic segments, while revenue grew in our APJC geographic segment. The emerging countries of BRICM, in the aggregate, experienced a 7% product revenue decline, with revenue declines in Mexico, China, and Brazil partially offset by increases in the other two BRICM countries. In addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced IT spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple-element arrangements; the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment. As has been the case in certain emerging countries from time to time, customers require greater levels of financing arrangements, service, and support, and these activities may occur in future periods, which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue.43Table of ContentsFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015 Total revenue was flat. Total company revenue not including SP Video CPE products increased 3%. Product revenue decreased by 1% in total, but increased by 2% for product revenue not including SP Video CPE products. Service revenue increased by 5%. Fiscal 2016 had 53 weeks, compared with 52 weeks in fiscal 2015, thus our results for fiscal 2016 reflect an extra week, the impact of which is discussed above. Our total revenue grew in our APJC geographic segment, while revenue declined in the Americas and EMEA geographic segments. The emerging countries of BRICM, in the aggregate, experienced 3% product revenue growth, with growth in China, India and Mexico, partially offset by decreases in the other two BRICM countries. Our revenue in fiscal 2016 was adversely affected by the depreciation of certain currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and especially currencies in certain emerging countries, although the indirect effects are difficult to measure.Product Revenue by SegmentThe following table presents the breakdown of product revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentProduct revenue: Americas $20,487 $21,663 $22,231 $(1,176) (5.4)% $(568) (2.6)%Percentage of product revenue 57.4% 58.1% 58.9% EMEA 9,369 9,682 9,882 (313) (3.2)% (200) (2.0)%Percentage of product revenue 26.2% 26.0% 26.2% APJC 5,849 5,909 5,637 (60) (1.0)% 272 4.8 %Percentage of product revenue 16.4% 15.9% 14.9% Total $35,705 $37,254 $37,750 $(1,549) (4.2)% $(496) (1.3)%During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed the sale of our SP Video CPE Business. As a result, revenue from this portion of the Service Provider Video product category will not recur in future periods. SP Video CPE Business revenue was $504 million and $1,846 million for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.AmericasFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016The 5% decrease in product revenue in the Americas segment was driven by declines in the service provider, public sector and commercial markets. Product revenue in the enterprise market was flat. The product revenue decrease in the service provider market was driven in large part by the absence of product sales related to our SP Video CPE Business in fiscal 2017. We had $378 million in product sales related to our SP Video CPE Business in fiscal 2016 in this segment. The product revenue decline in the public sector market was due primarily to lower sales to state and local governments and to the U.S. federal government. From a country perspective, product revenue decreased by 5% in the United States, 28% in Mexico and 7% in Brazil, partially offset by an increase of 2% in Canada.Fiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015The decrease in product revenue for the Americas segment was driven by a decline of $1,146 million in product sales related to our SP Video CPE Business. Product revenue not including SP Video CPE products increased for the Americas segment. From a customer markets perspective, the decrease in product revenue in the Americas segment of 3% was led by a significant decline in the service provider market driven by the sale of the SP Video CPE Business. We experienced product revenue growth in the commercial, public sector and enterprise markets. The product revenue growth in the public sector market was due primarily to higher sales to state and local governments, partially offset by lower sales to the U.S. federal government. From a country perspective, product revenue decreased by 34% in Brazil and 24% in Canada partially offset by a slight increase in the United States and an increase of 3% in Mexico. 44Table of ContentsEMEAFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016Product revenue in the EMEA segment decreased by 3%, driven by a decline in the service provider market and, to a lesser extent, declines in the public sector and enterprise markets. Product revenue in the commercial market was flat. The product revenue decrease in the service provider market was driven in part by the absence of product sales related to our SP Video CPE Business in fiscal 2017. We had $108 million in product sales related to our SP Video CPE Business in fiscal 2016 in this segment. Product revenue from emerging countries within EMEA and product revenue for the remainder of the EMEA segment each decreased by 3%.Fiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015The decrease in product revenue of 2%, or $200 million, for the EMEA segment was driven by a decline of $164 million in product sales related to our SP Video CPE Business. From a customer market perspective, the decrease was driven by product revenue declines in the service provider, public sector and enterprise markets, partially offset by product revenue growth in the commercial market. The decline in sales to the service provider market was due primarily to the sale of the SP Video CPE Business. Product revenue from emerging countries within EMEA decreased by 11%, led by a decline in Russia of 31%. Product revenue for the remainder of the EMEA segment, which primarily consists of countries in Western Europe, increased by 1%.APJCFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016Product revenue in the APJC segment decreased by 1%. The product revenue decrease was led by declines in the service provider and public sector markets, partially offset by product revenue growth in the commercial market. Product revenue in the enterprise market was flat. From a country perspective, product revenue decreased by 12% in China, driven by a decrease in sales of Service Provider Video software and solutions products, while product revenue increased by 11% in India, 9% in Australia and 2% in Japan. Product sales for this geographic segment were adversely impacted by an $18 million decrease in product sales related to the absence of our SP Video CPE Business.Fiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015The increase in product revenue in the APJC segment of 5% was led by solid growth in the service provider market and, to a lesser extent, growth in the enterprise, public sector and commercial markets. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 22% in China, driven by an increase in sales of Service Provider Video software and solutions products, and 18% in India, partially offset by product revenue decreases of 7% in Japan and 5% in Australia. Product revenue for this geographic segment was adversely impacted by a $32 million decrease in product revenue related to the sale of our SP Video CPE Business.45Table of ContentsProduct Revenue by Groups of Similar ProductsIn addition to the primary view on a geographic basis, we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes. Our product categories consist of the following categories: Switching; NGN Routing; Collaboration; Data Center; Wireless; Security; Service Provider Video; and Other Products. The following table presents revenue for groups of similar products (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentProduct revenue: Switching $13,949 $14,700 $14,712 $(751) (5.1)% $(12) (0.1)%Percentage of product revenue 39.1% 39.4% 39.0% NGN Routing 7,831 8,133 8,343 (302) (3.7)% (210) (2.5)%Percentage of product revenue 21.9% 21.8% 22.1% Collaboration 4,278 4,352 4,004 (74) (1.7)% 348 8.7 %Percentage of product revenue 12.0% 11.7% 10.6% Data Center 3,228 3,365 3,219 (137) (4.1)% 146 4.5 %Percentage of product revenue 9.0% 9.0% 8.5% Wireless 2,766 2,640 2,551 126 4.8 % 89 3.5 %Percentage of product revenue 7.7% 7.1% 6.8% Security 2,153 1,969 1,747 184 9.3 % 222 12.7 %Percentage of product revenue 6.0% 5.3% 4.6% Service Provider Video (1) 946 1,734 2,941 (788) (45.4)% (1,207) (41.0)%Percentage of product revenue 2.7% 4.7% 7.8% Other 554 361 233 193 53.5 % 128 54.9 %Percentage of product revenue 1.6% 1.0% 0.6% $35,705 $37,254 $37,750 $(1,549) (4.2)% $(496) (1.3)%(1) During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed the sale of the SP Video CPE Business. As a result, fiscal 2016 includes only four months of product revenue from SP Video CPE Business. SP Video CPE Business revenue was $504 million and $1,846 million for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period amounts to conform to the current period’s presentation. SwitchingFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016The decrease in revenue in our Switching product category of 5%, or $751 million, was driven primarily by a decrease in sales of Switching products used in campus environments, which comprise the majority of our Switching portfolio. We believe this was driven both by the uncertainty in the macro environment which led to a slowdown in customer spending, as well as by a highly competitive landscape. These impacts were partially offset by an increase in sales of our ACI portfolio which is included in our data center switching portfolio. In terms of subcategories, the decrease in revenue from our modular switches of 18%, or $784 million and the decrease in sales of storage products of 22%, or $95 million were partially offset by increased revenue from our LAN fixed-configuration switches of 1%, or $128 million. Revenue from our modular switches decreased driven by lower sales of most of the Cisco Catalyst Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches, partially offset by growth in Cisco Nexus 9500 Series Switches within this product category. Revenue from LAN fixed-configuration switches increased due to higher sales of our Cisco Nexus 9300 Series Switches, Cisco Catalyst 3650 Series Switches and Cisco Catalyst 3850 Series Switches, partially offset by a decrease in sales of certain other products in this portfolio. Fiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015We believe the flat revenue in our Switching product category was driven in large part by the uncertainty in the macro environment which led to a slowdown in customer spending. This led to flat revenue in our Switching products used in campus environments which comprise the majority of revenue within this product category. We also experienced decreased revenue from storage products. 46Table of ContentsThese impacts were offset by an increase in sales of our Switching products used in data centers, reflecting strength in our ACI portfolio. In terms of subcategories, the increase in revenue from LAN fixed-configuration switches of 5%, or $452 million was substantially offset by decreased revenue from our modular switches of 8%, or $375 million, and the decreased revenue from storage products of 17%, or $89 million. Revenue from our LAN-fixed configuration switches increased due primarily to higher sales of our Cisco Catalyst 3850 Series Switches, Cisco Catalyst 3650 Series Switches, Cisco Nexus 9300 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches, partially offset by a decrease in sales of certain other products in this portfolio. Decreased revenue from our modular switches was due primarily to lower sales of most of our Cisco Catalyst Series Switches and also due to lower sales of our Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches, partially offset by sales growth in Cisco Nexus 9500 Series Switches within this product category. NGN RoutingFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016Revenue in our NGN Routing product category decreased by 4%, or $302 million, driven by an 8%, or $211 million, decrease in revenue from our midrange and low-end router products and a 5%, or $208 million, decrease in revenue from our high-end router products. These declines were partially offset by a 10%, or $117 million, increase in revenue from other NGN Routing products. Revenue from our midrange and low-end router products decreased due to lower sales of our Cisco ISR products and certain of our access router products. The decrease in revenue from high-end router products was driven by a decrease in revenue from our mobility products within our ASRs and from our CRS products. Revenue from other NGN Routing products increased due to higher sales of cable access products and certain optical networking products.Fiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015We believe a cautious service provider capital expenditure spending environment negatively impacted sales in NGN Routing. Revenue in this product category decreased by 3%, or $210 million, driven by an 8%, or $378 million, decrease in revenue from our high-end router products partially offset by a 12%, or $126 million, increase in revenue from what we categorize as other NGN Routing products and a 2%, or $42 million, increase in revenue from our mid-range and low-end router products. Revenue from high-end router products decreased due to a decrease in revenue from most of our high-end router products, partially offset by higher sales of our CRS-X products. Revenue from other NGN Routing products increased due to higher sales of optical networking products. The revenue increase in the mid-range and low-end routers was primarily driven by higher sales of Cisco ISR products.CollaborationFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016Revenue from our Collaboration product category decreased by 2%, or $74 million, driven by a decrease in sales of Cisco Unified Communications and Cisco TelePresence products, partially offset by continued growth in Conferencing revenue. The decrease in Unified Communications revenue was driven primarily by decreased revenue from phones. Revenue from Cisco TelePresence products declined due to lower revenue from endpoint products. The growth in Conferencing revenue resulted from higher usage and recurring SaaS revenue from WebEx, which we include as product revenue in this category. We continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our Collaboration product category. Fiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015Revenue from our Collaboration product category increased by 9%, or $348 million, driven by growth across the various subcategories within this product category. The growth in Conferencing revenue resulted from higher usage and recurring revenue from WebEx. Revenue from Cisco TelePresence products grew due to higher revenue in infrastructure and endpoint products as a result of new product introductions. The increase in Unified Communications revenue was driven by higher software revenue.47Table of ContentsData CenterFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016Revenue in our Data Center product category decreased by 4%, or $137 million, driven by a decrease in sales of our Cisco Unified Computing System products, with declines in the commercial, enterprise and public sector markets partially offset by growth in the service provider market. We believe that both the uncertainty in the macro environment and the continued market transition with computing workloads shifting from blade server systems to rack-based systems continued to affect customer spending. The decrease in sales of our Cisco Unified Computing System products was partially offset by an increase in sales of our hyperconverged offering, HyperFlex.Fiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015The increase in revenue in our Data Center product category of 5%, or $146 million, was primarily driven by an increase in sales of our Cisco Unified Computing System products, with growth across all geographic segments and most of the customer markets. We believe the uncertainty in the macro environment led to a slowdown of customer spending for products in this category and we are seeing a market transition with computing workloads shifting from blade server systems to rack-based systems. WirelessFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016Revenue in our Wireless product category increased by 5%, or $126 million, due primarily to continued growth in sales of Meraki products within this product category, and an increase in sales of certain of our access point products, partially offset by a decrease in sales of our controller products. We continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our Wireless product category.Fiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015Revenue in our Wireless product category increased by 3%, or $89 million, due primarily to continued growth in sales of Meraki products within this category, partially offset by a decrease in sales of our controllers products. SecurityFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016Revenue in our Security product category increased 9%, or $184 million, driven by higher sales of unified threat management products, advanced threat security products, and web security products. We continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our Security product category.Fiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015Revenue in our Security product category increased 13%, or $222 million, driven by higher sales of advanced threat security, web security and unified threat management products.Service Provider VideoFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016The decrease in revenue from our Service Provider Video product category of 45%, or $788 million, was driven by a decrease in product sales of $504 million related to our SP Video CPE Business and a decrease in revenue from our video software and solutions products, particularly in China. Fiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015The decrease in revenue from our Service Provider Video product category of 41%, or $1,207 million, was driven by a decrease in product sales of $1,342 million related to our SP Video CPE Business which we sold during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue from certain cable access products and an increase in revenue from our video software and solutions products, particularly in China.Other ProductsThe increase in revenue in our Other Products category for fiscal 2017 was in large part due to increased revenue from our IoT products, driven by our fiscal 2016 Jasper acquisition. The acquisition of AppDynamics in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 also contributed to the increase in revenue in this product category. The increase in revenue for fiscal 2016 was due to increased revenue from data and analytics offerings, from our cloud-related offerings and from our IoT products, driven by our Jasper acquisition.48Table of ContentsService Revenue by SegmentThe following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015Years EndedJuly 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentService revenue: Americas$7,864 $7,729 $7,395 $135 1.7% $334 4.5%Percentage of service revenue63.9% 64.4% 64.8% EMEA2,635 2,620 2,466 15 0.6% 154 6.2%Percentage of service revenue21.4% 21.9% 21.6% APJC1,801 1,644 1,550 157 9.5% 94 6.1%Percentage of service revenue14.7% 13.7% 13.6% Total$12,300 $11,993 $11,411 $307 2.6% $582 5.1%Fiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016Service revenue grew 3%. Excluding the $200 million of additional revenue as a result of the extra week in fiscal 2016, service revenue grew 4%. Service revenue grew across all of our geographic segments. Technical support services revenue increased by 3% and advanced services revenue increased by 1%. Technical support services revenue increased across all geographic segments. The increase in technical support services revenue was driven by contract initiations and renewals associated with product sales and an increase in software support offerings. Advanced services revenue, which relates to professional services for specific customer network needs, had solid revenue growth in our APJC segment, declined slightly in our EMEA segment and was flat in our Americas segment.Fiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015Service revenue grew 5%, which includes a $200 million, or 2%, year-over-year increase as a result of the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016. Service revenue had solid growth across all of our geographic segments. Technical support services revenue increased by 5% and advanced services revenue increased by 7%. Technical support services revenue increased across all geographic segments. Renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with product sales provided an installed base of equipment being serviced which, in concert with new service offerings, were the primary factors driving the revenue increases. Advanced services revenue grew across all geographic segments.Gross MarginThe following table presents the gross margin for products and services (in millions, except percentages): AMOUNT PERCENTAGEYears EndedJuly 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015Gross margin: Product$22,006 $23,093 $22,373 61.6% 62.0% 59.3%Service8,218 7,867 7,308 66.8% 65.6% 64.0%Total$30,224 $30,960 $29,681 63.0% 62.9% 60.4%49Table of ContentsProduct Gross MarginFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016The following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017: Product Gross Margin PercentageFiscal 2016 62.0 %Product pricing (2.1)%Mix of products sold (0.3)%Supplier component remediation adjustment (0.1)%Other (0.1)%Productivity (1) 1.4 %SP Video CPE Business impact 0.8 %Fiscal 2017 61.6 % (1) Productivity includes overall manufacturing-related costs, such as component costs, warranty expense, provision for inventory, freight, logistics, shipment volume, and other items not categorized elsewhere.Product gross margin decreased by 0.4 percentage points as compared with fiscal 2016. The decrease in product gross margin was largely due to unfavorable impacts from product pricing, lower productivity benefits, and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by a benefit from the divestiture of the lower margin SP Video CPE business in fiscal 2016. The negative pricing impact was driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets. While productivity was positive to overall product gross margin, the benefit was lower than the prior year as these improvements were adversely impacted by an increase in the cost of certain memory components which are currently constrained. We expect the higher costs related to the constraint on these memory components to continue to impact productivity in the near term. In addition, productivity was negatively impacted by decreases in core routing and switching revenue which limited our ability to generate cost savings. Productivity improvements were driven by value engineering efforts (e.g. component redesign, board configuration, test processes, and transformation processes), lower warranty expenses and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations. The decrease in product gross margin was also due to an unfavorable mix of products sold driven by negative mix impacts from our NGN Routing, Switching and IoT products.Fiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015The following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016: Product Gross Margin PercentageFiscal 2015 59.3 %Productivity (1) 3.3 %SP Video CPE Business impact 1.5 %Amortization of purchased intangible assets 0.6 %Rockstar patent portfolio charge 0.5 %Product pricing (2.2)%Mix of products sold (0.8)%Supplier component remediation charge/adjustment (0.2)%Fiscal 2016 62.0 %Product gross margin increased by 2.7 percentage points compared with fiscal 2015. The increase in product gross margin was due in large part to productivity improvements, which were driven primarily by value engineering efforts; favorable component pricing; and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations. Our product gross margin also benefited from the sale during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 of our lower margin SP Video CPE Business, lower amortization expense and impairment charges related to acquisition-related intangible assets, and a $188 million charge to product cost of sales recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 related to the Rockstar Consortium patent portfolio.50Table of ContentsThe various factors contributing to the product gross margin increase were partially offset by unfavorable impacts from product pricing, which were driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets, an unfavorable mix of products sold and the lower supplier component remediation adjustment. The unfavorable mix of products sold was due to a negative mix impact from our Cisco Unified Computing System products, higher sales of Service Provider Video products (not including the CPE Business) and an unfavorable mix within Switching products. Service Gross MarginFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016Our service gross margin percentage increased by 1.2 percentage points due to higher sales volume, decreased delivery costs, favorable mix and, to a lesser extent, lower share-based compensation expense. These benefits to service gross margin were partially offset by increased headcount-related costs.Our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. Other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services.Fiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015Service gross margin percentage increased by 1.6 percentage points due to higher sales volume and decreased headcount-related costs. These benefits to gross margin were partially offset by increased partner delivery costs and increased outside services costs.Gross Margin by SegmentThe following table presents the total gross margin for each segment (in millions, except percentages): AMOUNT PERCENTAGEYears Ended July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015Gross margin: Americas $18,284 $18,986 $18,638 64.5% 64.6% 62.9%EMEA 7,855 7,998 7,731 65.4% 65.0% 62.6%APJC 4,741 4,620 4,313 62.0% 61.2% 60.0%Segment total 30,880 31,604 30,682 64.3% 64.2% 62.4%Unallocated corporate items (1) (656) (644) (1,001) Total $30,224 $30,960 $29,681 63.0% 62.9% 60.4% (1) The unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant litigation and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges. We do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments. Fiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016The Americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage decrease due to negative impacts from pricing and product mix, partially offset by productivity improvements and the sale of the lower margin SP Video CPE Business. The unfavorable mix impact was driven by NGN Routing, Switching and IoT products. The gross margin percentage increase in our EMEA segment was due primarily to higher service gross margin. Product gross margin in this segment also increased slightly due to the impact of productivity improvements, the sale of the lower margin SP Video CPE Business and a favorable product mix, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing.The APJC segment gross margin percentage increased due primarily to higher service gross margin. Product gross margin in this segment decreased due to negative impacts from pricing and product mix, partially offset by productivity improvements. The unfavorable mix impact was driven by our Cisco Unified Computing System products. The gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment. 51Table of ContentsFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015The Americas segment experienced a gross margin percentage increase due primarily to the sale of the lower margin SP Video CPE Business. In this geographic segment, productivity improvements were substantially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing and product mix. The unfavorable mix of products sold was due to increased revenue from our lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products and an unfavorable mix within our NGN Routing products. The gross margin percentage increase in our EMEA segment was due primarily to the impact of productivity improvements in this geographic segment and the sale of the SP Video CPE Business. Partially offsetting these favorable impacts to gross margin were negative impacts from pricing and an unfavorable product mix. The unfavorable mix of products sold was due primarily to increased revenue from our lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products. Higher service gross margin also contributed to the increase in the overall gross margin in this geographic segment.Our APJC segment gross margin percentage increased due to productivity improvements, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing and mix. The mix impact was driven primarily by higher sales from our Service Provider Video products (not including the SP Video CPE Business) and unfavorable mix within our NGN Routing products.Research and Development (“R&D”), Sales and Marketing, and General and Administrative (“G&A”) ExpensesR&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses are summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentResearch and development $6,059 $6,296 $6,207 $(237) (3.8)% $89 1.4 %Percentage of revenue 12.6% 12.8% 12.6% Sales and marketing 9,184 9,619 9,821 (435) (4.5)% (202) (2.1)%Percentage of revenue 19.1% 19.5% 20.0% General and administrative 1,993 1,814 2,040 179 9.9 % (226) (11.1)%Percentage of revenue 4.2% 3.7% 4.1% Total $17,236 $17,729 $18,068 $(493) (2.8)% $(339) (1.9)%Percentage of revenue 35.9% 36.0% 36.8% Our fiscal 2017 had one less week compared with fiscal 2016, which had an extra week. We estimate that the extra week in fiscal 2016 contributed approximately $116 million of the year-over-year decrease in total operating expenses (not including share-based compensation expense).R&D ExpensesFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016R&D expenses decreased primarily due to lower contracted services, lower headcount-related expenses, lower discretionary spending and lower acquisition-related costs, partially offset by higher share-based compensation expense. Lower headcount- related expenses were due to efficiencies related to our restructuring actions and the extra week in fiscal 2016.We continue to invest in R&D in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. If we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal R&D. Fiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015R&D expenses increased primarily due to higher headcount-related expenses attributable in part to the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 and, to a lesser extent, higher share-based compensation expense. These increases were partially offset by lower acquisition-related costs and lower discretionary spending.Sales and Marketing ExpensesFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016Sales and marketing expenses decreased due to lower headcount-related expenses, lower contracted services, lower discretionary spending, lower acquisition-related costs and, to a lesser extent, lower share-based compensation expense. Lower headcount-related expenses were due to efficiencies related to our restructuring actions. The extra week in fiscal 2016 also contributed to the decrease in headcount-related expenses.52Table of ContentsFiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015Sales and marketing expenses decreased due to lower discretionary spending and lower headcount-related expenses. The aforementioned items benefited from foreign exchange rates during fiscal 2016. Lower share-based compensation expense also contributed to the decrease. G&A ExpensesFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016G&A expenses increased primarily due to the $253 million pre-tax gain from the sale of our SP Video CPE Business recorded during fiscal 2016 and, to a lesser extent, higher share-based compensation expense. These increases were partially offset by lower headcount-related expenses and lower contracted services. The extra week in fiscal 2016 contributed to the decreased headcount-related expense.Fiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015G&A expenses decreased primarily due to the $253 million pre-tax gain from the sale of our SP Video CPE Business and, to a lesser extent, lower contracted services and lower share-based compensation expense, partially offset by higher headcount-related expenses. The extra week in fiscal 2016 contributed to the increased headcount-related expenses.Effect of Foreign CurrencyIn fiscal 2017, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $77 million, or 0.4%, compared with fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2016, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $567 million, or 3.1%, compared with fiscal 2015. Share-Based Compensation ExpenseThe following table presents share-based compensation expense (in millions):Years Ended July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015Cost of sales—product $85 $70 $50Cost of sales—service 134 142 157Share-based compensation expense in cost of sales 219 212 207Research and development 529 470 448Sales and marketing 542 545 559General and administrative 236 205 228Restructuring and other charges 3 26 (2)Share-based compensation expense in operating expenses 1,310 1,246 1,233Total share-based compensation expense $1,529 $1,458 $1,440The increase in share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2017, as compared with fiscal 2016, was due primarily to higher expense related to equity awards assumed with respect to our recent acquisitions. The increase in share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2016, as compared with fiscal 2015, was due primarily to the timing of restricted stock unit (RSU) grants and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016, partially offset by lower net expense associated with accelerated and modified awards. Amortization of Purchased Intangible AssetsThe following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets (in millions):Years Ended July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015Amortization of purchased intangible assets: Cost of sales $556 $577 $814Operating expenses Amortization of purchased intangible assets 259 303 359Restructuring and other charges 38 — —Total $853 $880 $1,17353Table of ContentsAmortization of purchased intangible assets decreased in fiscal 2017, as compared with fiscal 2016, due to certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized and lower impairment charges in fiscal 2017, partially offset by amortization of purchased intangible assets from our recent acquisitions.Amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased in fiscal 2016 as compared with fiscal 2015, due to certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized or impaired, partially offset by amortization of purchased intangible assets from our recent acquisitions. Lower impairment charges in fiscal 2016 also contributed to the decrease.Restructuring and Other ChargesIn August 2016, we announced a restructuring plan that will impact up to 6,600 employees, with estimated pretax charges of approximately $850 million. In connection with this restructuring plan, we incurred charges of $756 million during fiscal 2017. These charges were related primarily to severance and other one-time termination benefits and other associated costs. We expect the restructuring action to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from the restructuring action in our key priority areas such as security, IoT, collaboration, next generation data center and cloud. As a result, the overall cost savings from the restructuring action are not expected to be material for future periods. In connection with a restructuring action announced in August 2014, we incurred restructuring and other charges of $267 million and $489 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. These charges were related primarily to severance and other one-time termination benefits and other associated costs. We completed this plan at the end of fiscal 2016. Operating IncomeThe following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015Operating income $11,973 $12,660 $10,770Operating income as a percentage of revenue 24.9% 25.7% 21.9%For fiscal 2017, as compared with fiscal 2016, operating income decreased by 5%, and as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased by 0.8 percentage points. These decreases resulted primarily from an increase in restructuring and other charges related to the restructuring action announced in August 2016 and the $253 million pre-tax gain from the sale of our SP Video CPE Business recorded in fiscal 2016.For fiscal 2016, as compared with fiscal 2015, operating income increased by 18%, and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 3.8 percentage points. The increase resulted from the following: a gross margin percentage increase, driven in part by the sale of the lower margin SP Video CPE Business during fiscal 2016; the $253 million pre-tax gain from the sale of our SP Video CPE Business; and a decrease in restructuring and other charges related to the restructuring action announced in August 2014. 54Table of ContentsInterest and Other Income (Loss), NetInterest Income (Expense), Net The following table summarizes interest income and interest expense (in millions): Years Ended 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 Variance in Dollars Variance in DollarsInterest income$1,338 $1,005 $769 $333 $236Interest expense(861) (676) (566) (185) (110)Interest income (expense), net$477 $329 $203 $148 $126Fiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016Interest income increased driven by an increase in our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and fixed income investments as well as higher yields on our portfolio. The increase in interest expense was driven by higher average debt balances which includes commercial paper notes and the impact of higher effective interest rates on floating-rate senior notes and interest rate swaps associated with fixed-rate senior notes. Fiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015Interest income increased driven by an increase in our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and fixed income investments as well as higher yields on our portfolio of cash and investments. The increase in interest expense was driven by higher average debt balances and the impact of higher effective interest rates on floating-rate senior notes and interest rate swaps associated with fixed-rate senior notes. Other Income (Loss), Net The components of other income (loss), net, are summarized as follows (in millions): Years Ended 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015 Variance in Dollars Variance in DollarsGains (losses) on investments, net: Publicly traded equity securities$(45) $33 $116 $(78) $(83)Fixed income securities(42) (34) 41 (8) (75)Total available-for-sale investments(87) (1) 157 (86) (158)Privately held companies(46) (35) 82 (11) (117)Net gains (losses) on investments(133) (36) 239 (97) (275)Other gains (losses), net(30) (33) (11) 3 (22)Other income (loss), net$(163) $(69) $228 $(94) $(297)Fiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016The change in total net gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments was driven by $74 million of impairment charges on publicly traded equity securities. The change in net gains (losses) on investments in privately held companies was primarily due to higher impairment charges on investments in privately held companies, partially offset by higher realized gains on investments in privately held companies.The change in other gains (losses), net was driven by lower donation expense partially offset by impacts from customer lease terminations, foreign exchange and equity derivatives.Fiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015The change in total net gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments was primarily attributable to lower realized gains on publicly traded equity securities and net losses on fixed income securities in fiscal 2016 compared to net gains in fiscal 2015 as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities. The change in net gains (losses) on investments in privately held companies was primarily due to a gain of $126 million related to the reorganization of our investment in VCE, which was recorded in fiscal 2015. The change in other gains (losses), net was driven by higher donation expenses and net unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by higher gains from customer lease terminations.55Table of ContentsProvision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates, higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates, and expiration of or lapses in tax incentives. Our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries. If these earnings were distributed from the foreign subsidiaries to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes.Fiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 21.8% for fiscal 2017, compared with 16.9% for fiscal 2016. The net 4.9 percentage point increase in the effective tax rates was primarily due to the recognition of a net benefit to the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2016 related to our settlement with the IRS of all outstanding items covering fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010 and reinstatement of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit on December 18, 2015.For a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Fiscal 2016 Compared with Fiscal 2015The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 16.9% for fiscal 2016, compared with 19.8% for fiscal 2015. The net 2.9 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rates was primarily due to a non-recurring net tax benefit of $367 million, or 2.8 percentage points, related to a tax settlement with the IRS in fiscal 2016. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowsCash and Cash Equivalents and Investments The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments (in millions): July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 Increase (Decrease)Cash and cash equivalents$11,708 $7,631 $4,077Fixed income securities57,077 56,621 456Publicly traded equity securities1,707 1,504 203Total$70,492 $65,756 $4,736The net increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 was primarily the result of cash provided by operating activities of $13.9 billion and a net increase in debt of $5.3 billion. These sources of cash were partially offset by cash returned to shareholders in the form of cash dividends of $5.5 billion and repurchases of common stock of $3.7 billion under the stock repurchase program, net cash paid for acquisitions of $3.3 billion, the timing of settlements of investments and other of $1.1 billion and capital expenditures of $1.0 billion. Our total in cash and cash equivalents and investments held by various foreign subsidiaries was $67.5 billion and $59.8 billion as of July 29, 2017 and July 30, 2016, respectively. Under current tax laws and regulations, if these assets were to be distributed from the foreign subsidiaries to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. The balance of cash and cash equivalents and investments available in the United States as of July 29, 2017 and July 30, 2016 was $3.0 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively. We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our fixed income investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below.56Table of ContentsFree Cash Flow and Capital Allocation As part of our capital allocation strategy, we intend to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment. The following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions):Years EndedJuly 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 July 25, 2015Net cash provided by operating activities$13,876 $13,570 $12,552Acquisition of property and equipment(964) (1,146) (1,227)Free cash flow$12,912 $12,424 $11,325We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue, excess tax benefits resulting from share-based compensation, and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. For additional discussion, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report.We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net income provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do. The following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases (in millions, except per-share amounts): DIVIDENDS STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM TOTALYears Ended Per Share Amount Shares Weighted-Average Price per Share Amount AmountJuly 29, 2017 $1.10 $5,511 118 $31.38 $3,706 $9,217July 30, 2016 $0.94 $4,750 148 $26.45 $3,918 $8,668July 25, 2015 $0.80 $4,086 155 $27.22 $4,234 $8,320Any future dividends are subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. Accounts Receivable, Net The following table summarizes our accounts receivable, net (in millions): July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 Increase (Decrease)Accounts receivable, net$5,146 $5,847 $(701)Our accounts receivable net, as of July 29, 2017 decreased by approximately 12% compared with the end of fiscal 2016, primarily due to service and product billings being more linear in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.57Table of ContentsInventory Supply Chain The following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in millions, except annualized inventory turns): July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 Increase (Decrease)Inventories$1,616 $1,217 $399Annualized inventory turns12.3 14.6 (2.3)Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers$4,640 $3,896 $744Inventory as of July 29, 2017 increased by 33% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2016, and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by approximately 19%. On a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by 22% compared with the end of fiscal 2016. The increase in inventory was due to an increase in raw materials due to securing memory supply which is currently constrained and higher levels of manufactured finished goods in support of current order activity. The increase in purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was due to securing memory supply and procuring key components for specific product areas. We believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts.Our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods. Distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers. Manufactured finished goods consist primarily of build-to-order and build-to-stock products.We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity.Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels.Financing Receivables and Guarantees The following table summarizes our financing receivables (in millions): July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 Increase (Decrease)Lease receivables, net$2,650 $3,070 $(420)Loan receivables, net4,457 3,349 1,108Financed service contracts, net2,487 2,011 476Total, net$9,594 $8,430 $1,164Financing Receivables Our financing arrangements include leases, loans, and financed service contracts. Lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Our loan receivables include customers financing purchases of our hardware, software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We also provide financing to certain qualified customers for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services. The majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed. Financing receivables increased by 14% primarily due to a 33% increase in loan receivables driven by an increase in financing for software arrangements. We expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term.Financing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. 58Table of ContentsThe volume of channel partner financing was $27.0 billion, $26.9 billion, and $25.9 billion in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion as of July 29, 2017 and July 30, 2016, respectively. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. As of July 29, 2017, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $314 million, of which approximately $134 million was recorded as deferred revenue.BorrowingsSenior Notes The following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes (in millions): Maturity Date July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 Senior notes: Floating-rate notes: Three-month LIBOR plus 0.28%March 3, 2017(1)$— $1,000 Three-month LIBOR plus 0.60%February 21, 2018 1,000 1,000 Three-month LIBOR plus 0.31%June 15, 2018 900 900 Three-month LIBOR plus 0.50%March 1, 2019 500 500 Three-month LIBOR plus 0.34%September 20, 2019(2)500 — Fixed-rate notes: 1.10%March 3, 2017(1)— 2,400 3.15%March 14, 2017(1)— 750 1.40%February 28, 2018 1,250 1,250 1.65%June 15, 2018 1,600 1,600 4.95%February 15, 2019 2,000 2,000 1.60%February 28, 2019 1,000 1,000 2.125%March 1, 2019 1,750 1,750 1.40%September 20, 2019(2)1,500 — 4.45%January 15, 2020 2,500 2,500 2.45%June 15, 2020 1,500 1,500 2.20%February 28, 2021 2,500 2,500 2.90%March 4, 2021 500 500 1.85%September 20, 2021(2)2,000 — 3.00%June 15, 2022 500 500 2.60%February 28, 2023 500 500 2.20%September 20, 2023(2)750 — 3.625%March 4, 2024 1,000 1,000 3.50%June 15, 2025 500 500 2.95%February 28, 2026 750 750 2.50%September 20, 2026(2)1,500 — 5.90%February 15, 2039 2,000 2,000 5.50%January 15, 2040 2,000 2,000 Total $30,500 $28,400 (1) In March 2017, we repaid senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $4.15 billion upon maturity.(2) In September 2016, we issued senior notes for an aggregate principal amount of $6.25 billion.Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable quarterly on the floating-rate notes. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of July 29, 2017.59Table of ContentsCommercial Paper Effective March 31, 2017, we increased our borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program from $3.0 billion to $10.0 billion. We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. We had $3.2 billion and no commercial paper notes outstanding as of July 29, 2017 and July 30, 2016, respectively.Credit Facilities On May 15, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on May 15, 2020. Any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the highest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time, or (c) LIBOR, or a comparable or successor rate that is approved by the Administrative Agent (“Eurocurrency Rate”), for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, or (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate, plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., provided that in no event will the Eurocurrency Rate be less than zero. We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and/or extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to May 15, 2022.In addition, on March 30, 2017 we entered into a 364-Day credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on March 29, 2018. The credit agreement also provides us the option to, for a fee, convert any borrowings outstanding thereunder on March 29, 2018 to a term loan maturing no later than March 29, 2019. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the credit agreement will be based on either (i) the higher of (a) the rates on overnight Federal Funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System (i.e., Federal Funds rate) plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time or (c) LIBOR for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, or (ii) LIBOR plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by S&P Global Rating, a business unit of Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC, and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. These credit agreements require that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain interest coverage ratios as defined in these agreements. As of July 29, 2017, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratios and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under these credit facilities. Deferred Revenue The following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue (in millions): July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 Increase (Decrease)Service$11,302 $10,621 $681Product: Deferred revenue related to recurring software and subscription offers4,971 3,308 1,663Other product deferred revenue2,221 2,543 (322)Total product deferred revenue7,192 5,851 1,341 Total$18,494 $16,472 $2,022Reported as: Current$10,821 $10,155 $666Noncurrent7,673 6,317 1,356 Total$18,494 $16,472 $2,022Total deferred revenue increased 12% in fiscal 2017. Deferred product revenue increased 23% primarily due to increased deferrals related to recurring software and subscription offers. The portion of product deferred revenue related to recurring software and subscription offers grew 50%, to $5.0 billion, as of July 29, 2017. Wireless, Security, and Collaboration were the key product category contributors to this product deferred revenue growth during the fiscal year. Deferred service revenue increased 6% driven by the timing and amount of multiyear arrangements and our focus on contract renewals and service contract attach rates. 60Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. In addition, we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at July 29, 2017 (in millions): PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIODJuly 29, 2017Total Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 YearsOperating leases$1,237 $417 $467 $210 $143Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers4,640 4,620 20 — —Other purchase obligations1,987 750 867 284 86Senior notes30,500 4,750 11,250 5,500 9,000Other long-term liabilities1,179 — 209 99 871Total by period$39,543 $10,537 $12,813 $6,093 $10,100Other long-term liabilities (uncertainty in the timing of future payments)1,521 Total$41,064 Operating Leases For more information on our operating leases, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. A significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in “Inventory Supply Chain.” As of July 29, 2017, the liability for these purchase commitments was $162 million and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table.Other Purchase Obligations Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations. Long-Term Debt The amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $1,250 million and deferred tax liabilities of $271 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).Other CommitmentsIn connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Insieme Networks, Inc. In fiscal 2012, we made an investment in Insieme, an early stage company focused on research and development in the data center market. This investment included $100 million of funding and a license to certain of our technology. During fiscal 2014, we acquired the remaining interests in Insieme, at which time the former noncontrolling interest holders became eligible to receive up to two milestone payments, which were determined using agreed-upon formulas based primarily on revenue for certain of Insieme’s products. The former noncontrolling interest holders earned the maximum amount related to these two milestone payments and were paid approximately $441 million and $389 million during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. During fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, we recorded compensation expense of $47 million, $160 million and $207 million, respectively, related to these milestone payments. We do not expect a material amount of future compensation expense or further milestone payments related to this acquisition.61Table of ContentsOther Funding Commitments We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $216 million as of July 29, 2017, compared with $222 million as of July 30, 2016.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements. In the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies including venture funds and provide financing to certain customers. Certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings, and we have determined that as of July 29, 2017 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities.On an ongoing basis, we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing Receivables and Guarantees.”Securities LendingWe periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale investments. These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. The average daily balance of securities lending for fiscal 2017 and 2016 was $0.7 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. As of July 29, 2017 and July 30, 2016, we had no outstanding securities lending transactions. We believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements. Liquidity and Capital Resource RequirementsBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, pending acquisitions, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources. Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskOur financial position is exposed to a variety of risks, including interest rate risk, equity price risk, and foreign currency exchange risk.Interest Rate RiskFixed Income Securities We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk. At any time, a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates, including the impact from lower credit spreads, could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives. We had no outstanding hedging instruments for our fixed income securities as of July 29, 2017. Our fixed income investments are held for purposes other than trading. Our fixed income investments are not leveraged as of July 29, 2017. We monitor our interest rate and credit risks, including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong. 62Table of ContentsThe following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our fixed income securities, including the hedging effects when applicable, as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates. The market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (“BPS”), plus 100 BPS, and plus 150 BPS. Due to the low interest rate environment at the end of fiscal 2016, we did not believe a parallel shift of minus 100 BPS or minus 150 BPS was relevant. The hypothetical fair values as of July 29, 2017 and July 30, 2016 are as follows (in millions): VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTS FAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 29, 2017 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPSFixed income securities$58,728 $58,177 $57,627 $57,077 $56,527 $55,977 $55,426 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTS FAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 30, 2016 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPSFixed income securitiesN/A N/A $57,074 $56,621 $56,168 $55,715 $55,262Financing Receivables As of July 29, 2017, our financing receivables had a carrying value of $9.6 billion, compared with $8.4 billion as of July 30, 2016. As of July 29, 2017, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.1 billion, respectively. Debt As of July 29, 2017, we had $30.5 billion in principal amount of senior notes outstanding, which consisted of $2.9 billion floating-rate notes and $27.6 billion fixed-rate notes. The carrying amount of the senior notes was $30.5 billion, and the related fair value based on market prices was $32.1 billion. As of July 29, 2017, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed-rate debt, excluding the $6.8 billion of hedged debt, by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.6 billion, respectively. However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed-rate debt that is not hedged.Equity Price RiskThe fair value of our equity investments in publicly traded companies is subject to market price volatility. We may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio. Our equity portfolio consists of securities with characteristics that most closely match the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index or NASDAQ Composite Index. These equity securities are held for purposes other than trading. To manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain equity securities, we may enter into equity derivatives designated as hedging instruments.Publicly Traded Equity Securities The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of publicly traded equity securities as a result of selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each equity security in the portfolio, excluding hedged equity securities, if any. Potential fluctuations in the price of each equity security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 20%, and 30% were selected based on potential near-term changes in those security prices. The hypothetical fair values as of July 29, 2017 and July 30, 2016 are as follows (in millions): VALUATION OFSECURITIESGIVEN AN X%DECREASE INEACH STOCK’S PRICE FAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 29, 2017 VALUATION OFSECURITIESGIVEN AN X%INCREASE INEACH STOCK’S PRICE (30)% (20)% (10)% 10% 20% 30%Publicly traded equity securities$1,195 $1,366 $1,536 $1,707 $1,878 $2,048 $2,219 VALUATION OFSECURITIESGIVEN AN X%DECREASE INEACH STOCK’S PRICE FAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 30, 2016 VALUATION OFSECURITIESGIVEN AN X%INCREASE INEACH STOCK’S PRICE (30)% (20)% (10)% 10% 20% 30%Publicly traded equity securities$1,053 $1,203 $1,354 $1,504 $1,654 $1,805 $1,95563Table of ContentsInvestments in Privately Held Companies We have also invested in privately held companies. These investments are recorded in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are accounted for using primarily either the cost or the equity method. As of July 29, 2017, the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was $983 million, compared with $1,003 million at July 30, 2016. Some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including, among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return. Foreign Currency Exchange RiskOur foreign exchange forward and option contracts outstanding at fiscal year-end are summarized in U.S. dollar equivalents as follows (in millions): July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair ValueForward contracts: Purchased$2,562 $39 $3,079 $(41)Sold$729 $(2) $651 $—Option contracts: Purchased$528 $7 $688 $4Sold$486 $(1) $620 $(10)We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations.Approximately 70% of our operating expenses are U.S.-dollar denominated. In fiscal 2017, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased our combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $77 million, or 0.4%, as compared with fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2016, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased our combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $567 million, or 3.1%, as compared with fiscal 2015. To reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by non-U.S.-dollar denominated operating expenses and costs, we hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts. These hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons. In designing a specific hedging approach, we consider several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of exposures, costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument, and potential effectiveness of the hedge. The gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales.We also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities. The market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables, investments, and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances. We do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for speculative purposes.64Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:09:30.569460

Across networking, security, collaboration, applications and the cloud, our evolving intent-based technologies are constantly learning and adapting to provide customers with a highly secure, intelligent platform for their digital business. A summary of our results is as follows (in millions, except percentages and per-share amounts): Three Months Ended Years Ended July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 Variance July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 Variance Revenue$12,844 $12,133 6 % $49,330 $48,005 3 % Gross margin percentage61.7 % 62.2% (0.5)pts62.0% 63.0% (1.0)ptsResearch and development$1,626 $1,499 8 % $6,332 $6,059 5 % Sales and marketing$2,348 $2,318 1 % $9,242 $9,184 1 % General and administrative$543 $495 10 % $2,144 $1,993 8 % Total R&D, sales and marketing, general and administrative$4,517 $4,312 5 % $17,718 $17,236 3 % Total as a percentage of revenue35.2 % 35.5% (0.3)pts35.9% 35.9% —pts Amortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses$33 $58 (43)% $221 $259 (15)% Restructuring and other charges included in operating expenses$26 $142 (82)% $358 $756 (53)% Operating income as a percentage of revenue26.1 % 25.0% 1.1pts25.0% 24.9% 0.1ptsIncome tax percentage (1)(5.9)% 23.8% (29.7)pts99.2% 21.8% 77.4ptsNet income (1)$3,803 $2,424 57 % $110 $9,609 (99)% Net income as a percentage of revenue29.6 % 20.0% 9.6pts0.2% 20.0% (19.8)ptsEarnings per share—diluted (1)$0.81 $0.48 69 % $0.02 $1.90 (99)% (1) Fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 results include an $863 million benefit and a $10.4 billion charge, respectively, related to the enactment of the Tax Act.31Table of ContentsFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017In fiscal 2018, we saw broad strength across the business and delivered solid revenue growth, margins, cash flow and returns for our shareholders. We remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we believe that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities. Our product revenue reflected growth in Infrastructure Platforms, Applications and Security, and we continued to make progress in the transition of our business model to increased software and subscriptions. We continue to operate in a challenging and highly competitive environment. We experienced some weakness in the service provider market and we expect ongoing uncertainty in that area. While the overall environment remains uncertain, we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term. Total revenue increased by 3% compared with fiscal 2017. Within total revenue, product and service revenue each increased by 3%. Total gross margin decreased by 1.0 percentage points, driven primarily by unfavorable impacts from pricing, a $127 million legal and indemnification settlement charge, and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by productivity benefits. While productivity was positive to overall product gross margin, the benefit was lower than in the prior year as these improvements were adversely impacted by an increase in the cost of certain components which are currently constrained. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, were flat. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 0.1 percentage points. Diluted earnings per share and net income each decreased by 99% due to the $10.4 billion provisional tax expense related to the Tax Act, comprised of $8.1 billion U.S. transition tax, $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax, and $1.1 billion of net deferred tax assets re-measurement.In terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the Americas increased by $0.7 billion, EMEA revenue increased by $0.4 billion, and revenue in our APJC segment increased by $0.2 billion. These increases reflect broad strength across several countries within these segments. The “BRICM” countries experienced product revenue growth of 2% in the aggregate, driven by increased product revenue in the emerging countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China of 17%, 10%, 3% and 3%, respectively, partially offset by a product revenue decline of 16% in Mexico.From a customer market standpoint, we experienced solid product revenue growth in the commercial market and, to a lesser extent, in the enterprise and public sector markets. Product revenue in the service provider market declined with ongoing uncertainty in that area. From a product category perspective, the product revenue increase of 3% was driven by a 2% product revenue increase in Infrastructure Platforms and solid product revenue growth in Applications and Security of 10% and 9%, respectively. We saw broad strength across the portfolio, with the exception of routing related to the weakness in the service provider market. 32Table of ContentsFourth Quarter SnapshotFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, total revenue increased by 6%. Within total revenue, product revenue increased by 7% and service revenue increased by 3%. With regard to our geographic segment performance, on a year-over-year basis, revenue in the Americas, EMEA and APJC increased by 5%, 8% and 6%, respectively. From a product category perspective, we experienced broad strength across the portfolio. Total gross margin decreased by 0.5 percentage points, driven by some specific transactions with service providers in our APJC segment. Our gross margin also decreased due to unfavorable pricing, product mix and higher component costs, partially offset by improved productivity benefits. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively decreased by 0.3 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 1.1 percentage points. Diluted earnings per share increased by 69% and net income increased by 57%, due in part to an $863 million tax benefit related to the Tax Act. Strategy and Priorities As our customers add billions of new connections to their enterprises, and as more applications move to a multi-cloud environment, we believe the network continues to be extremely critical. We believe that our customers are looking for intent-based networks that provide meaningful business value through automation, security, and analytics across private, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments. Our vision is to deliver highly secure, software-defined, automated and intelligent platforms for our customers. Our strategic priorities include the following: accelerating our pace of innovation, increasing the value of the network, and transforming our business model. For a full discussion of our strategy and priorities, see Item 1. Business.Other Key Financial MeasuresThe following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 (in millions): Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017Cash and cash equivalents and investments $46,548 $70,492Cash provided by operating activities $13,666 $13,876Deferred revenue $19,685 $18,494Repurchases of common stock—stock repurchase program $17,661 $3,706Dividends $5,968 $5,511Inventories $1,846 $1,61633Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met:•Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Contracts, Internet commerce agreements, and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.•Delivery has occurred. Shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery. For software, delivery is considered to have occurred upon unrestricted license access and license term commencement, when applicable.•The fee is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.•Collectibility is reasonably assured. We assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer’s payment history.In instances where final acceptance of the product, system, or solution is specified by the customer, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. When a sale involves multiple deliverables, such as sales of products that include services, the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting, and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price. Revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met. For hosting arrangements, we recognize revenue ratably over the hosting period, while usage revenue is recognized based on utilization. Software subscription revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription term upon delivery of the first product and commencement of the term. The amount of revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and, if so, our valuation of the units of accounting. Our multiple element arrangements may contain only deliverables within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605, Revenue Recognition, deliverables within the scope of ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition, or a combination of both. According to the accounting guidance prescribed in ASC 605, we use vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE) for each of those units, when available. We determine VSOE based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the historical standalone transactions have the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range, generally evidenced by approximately 80% of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus 15% of the median rates. When VSOE does not exist, we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multiple-deliverable arrangements. Under the selling price hierarchy, third-party evidence of selling price (TPE) will be considered if VSOE does not exist, and estimated selling price (ESP) will be used if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Generally, we are not able to determine TPE because our go-to-market strategy differs from that of others in our markets, and the extent of our proprietary technology varies among comparable products or services from those of our peers. In determining ESP, we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors, based on the characteristics of the deliverable. We typically arrive at an ESP for a product or service that is not sold separately by considering company-specific factors such as geographies, competitive landscape, internal costs, profitability objectives, pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing, and existing portfolio pricing and discounting. As our business and offerings evolve over time, our pricing practices may be required to be modified accordingly, which could result in changes in selling prices, including both VSOE and ESP, in subsequent periods. There were no material impacts during fiscal 2018 from changes in VSOE, TPE, or ESP.We make sales to distributors which we refer to as two-tier sales to the end customer. Revenue from two-tier distributors is recognized based on a sell-through method using point-of-sale information provided by these distributors. Distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other incentive programs, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs. If actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.34Table of ContentsIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition. ASC 606 will supersede nearly all U.S. GAAP on revenue recognition and eliminate industry-specific guidance. The underlying principle of the new standard is to recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services at an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. It also requires increased disclosures including the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows related to contracts with customers.ASC 606 allows two methods of adoption: i) retrospectively to each prior period presented (“full retrospective method”), or ii) retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized in retained earnings as of the date of adoption (“modified retrospective method”). We will adopt the new standard using the modified retrospective method at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2019.We do not expect that ASC 606 will have a material impact on total revenue for fiscal 2019 based on two factors: i) revenue will be accelerated consistent with the changes in timing as indicated in the table in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, largely offset by ii) the reduction of revenue from software arrangements where revenue was previously deferred in prior periods and recognized ratably over time as required under the current standard. This preliminary assessment is based on the types and number of revenue arrangements currently in place. The exact impact of ASC 606 will be dependent on facts and circumstances at adoption and could vary from quarter to quarter. For the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we expect that the adoption of ASC 606 may increase total revenue by about 1% on a year-over-year basis. For further discussion of ASC 606, including the estimated impacts on transition date, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowances for Receivables and Sales ReturnsThe allowances for receivables were as follows (in millions, except percentages): July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017Allowance for doubtful accounts $129 $211Percentage of gross accounts receivable 2.3% 3.9%Allowance for credit loss—lease receivables $135 $162Percentage of gross lease receivables (1) 4.7% 5.5%Allowance for credit loss—loan receivables $60 $103Percentage of gross loan receivables 1.2% 2.3%(1) Calculated as allowance for credit loss on lease receivables as a percentage of gross lease receivables and residual value before unearned income.The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience, credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay as well as historical and expected default frequency rates, which are published by major third-party credit-rating agencies and are updated on a quarterly basis. We also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts. If a major customer’s creditworthiness deteriorates, if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, or if other circumstances arise, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, and additional allowances could be required, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.The allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis. When evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis, we consider historical experience, credit quality and age of receivable balances, and economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. When evaluating financing receivables on a collective basis, we use expected default frequency rates published by a major third-party credit-rating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default, while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions, concentration of risk and correlation. Determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings, as well as assessing factors such as economic conditions, concentration of risk, and correlation, are complex and subjective. Our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results. Both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible.35Table of ContentsA reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. The reserve for future sales returns as of July 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017 was $123 million and $122 million, respectively, and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue. If the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established, our revenue could be adversely affected. Inventory Valuation and Liability for Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and SuppliersInventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories, determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of our cost of sales. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory.Our provision for inventory was $63 million, $74 million, and $65 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was $105 million, $124 million, and $134 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we could be required to increase our inventory write-downs, and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and accordingly our profitability, could be adversely affected. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments.Loss Contingencies and Product WarrantiesWe are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.Our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years, and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty. We accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs, technical support labor costs, and associated overhead. Material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment. Technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period. Overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities.If we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected, our profitability could be adversely affected.Fair Value MeasurementsOur fixed income and publicly traded equity securities, collectively, are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at a fair value of $37.6 billion as of July 28, 2018, compared with $58.8 billion as of July 29, 2017. Our fixed income investment portfolio, as of July 28, 2018, consisted primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.As described more fully in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a valuation hierarchy is based on the level of independent, objective evidence available regarding the value of the investments. It encompasses three classes of investments: Level 1 consists of securities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical securities; Level 2 consists of securities for which observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs are used, such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets and model-derived valuations for which the variables are derived from, or corroborated by, observable market data; and Level 3 consists of securities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value.36Table of ContentsOur Level 2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. We use inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from independent pricing vendors, quoted market prices, or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities. We use such pricing data as the primary input, to which we have not made any material adjustments during fiscal 2018 and 2017, to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio. We are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates.The inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness, may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information, and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to its estimate of fair value. The assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective. However, given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio, and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets, we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of subjectivity and judgment was material to the valuation of the investment portfolio as of July 28, 2018. Other-than-Temporary Impairments We recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary. The ultimate value realized on these securities, to the extent unhedged, is subject to market price volatility until they are sold.If the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary. An impairment is considered other than temporary if (i) we have the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on (i) or (ii) described in the prior sentence, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (iii), the amount representing credit loss, defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security, will be recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). In estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected, we consider all available information, including past events, current conditions, the remaining payment terms of the security, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults, and the value of underlying collateral.For publicly traded equity securities, we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.We also have investments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages. As of July 28, 2018, our investments in privately held companies were $1,096 million, compared with $983 million as of July 29, 2017, and were included in other assets. We monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment, and we make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required, based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize.Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Asset ImpairmentsOur methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.The goodwill recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017 was $31.7 billion and $29.8 billion, respectively. The increase in goodwill during fiscal 2018 was due in large part to our acquisition of BroadSoft. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016. For the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2018, the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was $73.0 billion for the Americas, $53.0 billion for EMEA, and $35.5 billion for APJC. 37Table of ContentsDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. The fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. We consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were $1 million, $47 million, and $74 million during fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R&D tax credits, domestic manufacturing deductions, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, international realignments, and transfer pricing adjustments. Our effective tax rate was 99.2%, 21.8%, and 16.9% in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted. The Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate income tax rate (“federal tax rate”) from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implementing a modified territorial tax system, and imposing a mandatory one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As a fiscal-year taxpayer, certain provisions of the Tax Act impact us in fiscal 2018, including the change in the federal tax rate and the one-time transition tax, while other provisions will be effective at the beginning of fiscal 2019 including the implementation of a modified territorial tax system and other changes to how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax, and elimination of the domestic manufacturing deduction. As a result of the decrease in the federal tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, we have computed our income tax expense for the July 28, 2018 fiscal year using a blended federal tax rate of 27%. The 21% federal tax rate will apply to our fiscal year ending July 27, 2019 and each year thereafter. We must remeasure our DTA using the federal tax rate that will apply when the related temporary differences are expected to reverse.In December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which addresses how a company recognizes provisional estimates when it does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the effect of the changes in the Tax Act. The measurement period ends when a company has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting, but cannot extend beyond one year. The final impact of the Tax Act may differ from the provisional estimates due to changes in interpretations of the Tax Act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the Tax Act, by changes in accounting standard for income taxes and related interpretations in response to the Tax Act, and any updates or changes to estimates used in the provisional amounts. We have determined that the $8.1 billion of tax expense for the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax, and the $1.1 billion of tax expense for DTA re-measurement were each provisional amounts and reasonable estimates for fiscal 2018. Estimates used in the provisional amounts include: the anticipated reversal pattern of the gross DTAs; and earnings, cash positions, foreign taxes and withholding taxes attributable to foreign subsidiaries.38Table of ContentsSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 36 countries, including the United States, has made changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. As a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. 39Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSRevenueThe following table presents the breakdown of revenue between product and service (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentRevenue: Product $36,709 $35,705 $37,254 $1,004 3% $(1,549) (4)%Percentage of revenue 74.4% 74.4% 75.6% Service 12,621 12,300 11,993 321 3% 307 3 %Percentage of revenue 25.6% 25.6% 24.4% Total $49,330 $48,005 $49,247 $1,325 3% $(1,242) (3)%We manage our business primarily on a geographic basis, organized into three geographic segments.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed the sale of the Customer Premises Equipment portion of our Service Provider Video Connected Devices business (“SP Video CPE Business”). SP Video CPE Business revenue was $504 million for fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017 Total revenue increased by 3%. Product and service revenue each increased by 3%. Our total revenue reflected growth across each of our geographic segments. Product revenue for the emerging countries of BRICM, in the aggregate, experienced 2% product revenue growth, with increases in Brazil, Russia, India and China partially offset by a decrease in Mexico.In addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced IT spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple-element arrangements; the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment. As has been the case in certain emerging countries from time to time, customers require greater levels of financing arrangements, service, and support, and these activities may occur in future periods, which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue.40Table of ContentsFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016 Total revenue decreased by 3%. Total company revenue not including SP Video CPE products decreased 2%. Product revenue decreased by 4% while service revenue increased by 3%. Fiscal 2017 had 52 weeks, compared with 53 weeks in fiscal 2016, thus our results for fiscal 2017 reflect one less extra week. We estimate that the additional revenue associated with the extra week was approximately $265 million, $200 million of which was from our services subscriptions, and $65 million from our SaaS offerings such as WebEx, and a small amount from product distribution. Our total revenue declined in the Americas and EMEA geographic segments, while revenue grew in our APJC geographic segment. The emerging countries of BRICM, in the aggregate, experienced a 7% product revenue decline, with revenue declines in Mexico, China, and Brazil partially offset by increases in the other two BRICM countries.

AmericasFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017Product revenue in the Americas segment increased by 3%, driven by solid growth in the commercial and enterprise markets and, to a lesser extent, growth in the public sector market. Product revenue in the service provider market was flat. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 3% in the United States, 9% in Canada and 17% in Brazil, partially offset by a decrease of 16% in Mexico. Fiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016The 5% decrease in product revenue in the Americas segment was driven by declines in the service provider, public sector and commercial markets. Product revenue in the enterprise market was flat. The product revenue decrease in the service provider market was driven in large part by the absence of product sales related to our SP Video CPE Business in fiscal 2017. We had $378 million in product sales related to our SP Video CPE Business in fiscal 2016 in this segment. The product revenue decline in the public sector market was due primarily to lower sales to state and local governments and to the U.S. federal government. From a country perspective, product revenue decreased by 5% in the United States, 28% in Mexico and 7% in Brazil, partially offset by an increase of 2% in Canada.EMEAFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017The increase in product revenue in the EMEA segment of 3% was driven by solid growth in the commercial and public sector markets and, to a lesser extent, growth in the enterprise market. These increases were partially offset by a product revenue decline in the service provider market. Product revenue from emerging countries within EMEA and the remainder of the EMEA segment, which primarily consists of countries in Western Europe, each increased by 3%.41Table of ContentsFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016Product revenue in the EMEA segment decreased by 3%, driven by a decline in the service provider market and, to a lesser extent, declines in the public sector and enterprise markets. Product revenue in the commercial market was flat. The product revenue decrease in the service provider market was driven in part by the absence of product sales related to our SP Video CPE Business in fiscal 2017. We had $108 million in product sales related to our SP Video CPE Business in fiscal 2016 in this segment. Product revenue from emerging countries within EMEA and product revenue for the remainder of the EMEA segment each decreased by 3%.APJCFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017Product revenue in the APJC segment increased by 2%. The product revenue increase was led by solid growth in the commercial and enterprise markets. These increases were partially offset by product revenue declines in the service provider and public sector markets. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 3% in China and 3% in India, partially offset by a decrease of 3% in Japan. Fiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016Product revenue in the APJC segment decreased by 1%. The product revenue decrease was led by declines in the service provider and public sector markets, partially offset by product revenue growth in the commercial market. Product revenue in the enterprise market was flat. From a country perspective, product revenue decreased by 12% in China, driven by a decrease in sales of Service Provider Video Software and Solutions products, while product revenue increased by 11% in India, 9% in Australia and 2% in Japan. Product sales for this geographic segment were adversely impacted by an $18 million decrease in product sales related to the absence of our SP Video CPE Business.Product Revenue by Groups of Similar ProductsIn addition to the primary view on a geographic basis, we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes. Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we began reporting our product revenue in the following categories: Infrastructure Platforms, Applications, Security, and Other Products. This change better aligns our product categories with our evolving business model. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.The following table presents revenue for groups of similar products (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentProduct revenue: Infrastructure Platforms $28,270 $27,779 $28,851 $491 2 % $(1,072) (4)%Applications 5,035 4,568 4,438 467 10 % 130 3 %Security 2,353 2,153 1,969 200 9 % 184 9 %Other Products 1,050 1,205 1,996 (155) (13)% (791) (40)% $36,709 $35,705 $37,254 $1,004 3 % $(1,549) (4)%Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. Infrastructure PlatformsFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017The Infrastructure Platforms product category represents our core networking offerings related to switching, routing, wireless, and the data center. Infrastructure Platforms revenue increased by 2%, or $491 million, with strength across the portfolio with the exception of routing. Switching experienced growth, with solid revenue growth in data center switching driven by an increase in sales of Cisco Nexus 9000 Series products, and with revenue growth in campus switching driven by our intent-based networking Cisco Catalyst 9000 Series. Data center had strong double digit growth driven by higher sales of server products and our hyperconverged data center offering, HyperFlex. We also experienced solid revenue growth from wireless products driven by Meraki as well as our Wave 2 offerings. We had a decrease in sales of routing products, driven by continued weakness in the service provider market. 42Table of ContentsFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016Revenue from the Infrastructure Platforms product category decreased by 4% or $1,072 million, driven primarily by lower revenue from switching products. Within switching, we experienced a decrease in sales of switching products used in campus environments, which we believe was driven both by the uncertainty in the macro environment which led to a slowdown in customer spending, as well as by a highly competitive landscape. These impacts were partially offset by an increase in sales of our ACI portfolio which is included in our data center switching portfolio. We also experienced a decrease in revenue from routing products driven by weakness in enterprise access and a decrease in revenue from data center due to lower sales of server products. We had revenue growth from wireless products driven by Meraki. ApplicationsFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017The Applications product category includes our collaboration offerings (unified communications, Cisco TelePresence and conferencing) as well as the Internet of Things (IoT) and analytics software offerings from Jasper and AppDynamics, respectively. Revenue in our Applications product category increased by 10%, or $467 million, with growth across all of the businesses. We experienced solid growth in the Telepresence, unified communications, conferencing and analytics from our fiscal 2017 acquisition of AppDynamics. We continued to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our Applications product category. Fiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016The increase in revenue in our Applications product category by 3%, or $130 million, was in large part due to increased revenue from our IoT software offerings, driven by our fiscal 2016 Jasper acquisition. The growth in Conferencing revenue and the acquisition of AppDynamics in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 also contributed to the revenue increase in this product category. These increases in revenue were partially offset by decreased revenue from unified communications and Telepresence. SecurityFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017Revenue in our Security product category increased 9%, or $200 million, driven by higher sales of unified threat management, web security, policy and access and advanced threat products. We continued to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our Security product category.Fiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016Revenue in our Security product category increased 9%, or $184 million, driven by higher sales of unified threat management, advanced threat security, and web security products. Other ProductsFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017The decrease in revenue from our Other Products category was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue from Service Provider Video Software and Solutions (“SPVSS”). On May 1, 2018, we announced a definitive agreement to sell the SPVSS business. We expect this transaction to close in the first half of fiscal 2019 subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Fiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016The decrease in revenue in our Other Products category was in large part due to a decrease in product sales of $504 million related to our SP Video CPE Business and a decrease in revenue from SPVSS products.43Table of ContentsService Revenue by SegmentThe following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016Years EndedJuly 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentService revenue: Americas$7,982 $7,864 $7,729 $118 2% $135 2%Percentage of service revenue63.3% 63.9% 64.4% EMEA2,754 2,635 2,620 119 5% 15 1%Percentage of service revenue21.8% 21.4% 21.9% APJC1,885 1,801 1,644 84 5% 157 10%Percentage of service revenue14.9% 14.7% 13.7% Total$12,621 $12,300 $11,993 $321 3% $307 3%Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. Fiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017Service revenue increased across all geographic segments. Technical support services revenue increased by 2% and advanced services revenue increased by 4%. Technical support services revenue increased across all geographic segments. The increase in technical support services revenue was driven by an increase in software and solution support offerings. Advanced services revenue, which relates to professional services for specific customer network needs, had solid growth in the EMEA segment and, to a lesser extent, increased in our Americas and APJC segments. Fiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016Service revenue grew 3%. Excluding the $200 million of additional revenue as a result of the extra week in fiscal 2016, service revenue grew 4%. Service revenue grew across all of our geographic segments. Technical support services revenue increased by 3% and advanced services revenue increased by 1%. Technical support services revenue increased across all geographic segments. The increase in technical support services revenue was driven by contract initiations and renewals associated with product sales and an increase in software support offerings. Advanced services revenue had solid revenue growth in our APJC segment, declined slightly in our EMEA segment and was flat in our Americas segment.Gross MarginThe following table presents the gross margin for products and services (in millions, except percentages): AMOUNT PERCENTAGEYears EndedJuly 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016Gross margin: Product$22,282 $22,006 $23,093 60.7% 61.6% 62.0%Service8,324 8,218 7,867 66.0% 66.8% 65.6%Total$30,606 $30,224 $30,960 62.0% 63.0% 62.9%44Table of ContentsProduct Gross MarginFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017The following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018: Product Gross Margin PercentageFiscal 2017 61.6 %Product pricing (1.4)%Legal and indemnification settlements (0.3)%Mix of products sold (0.2)%Amortization of purchased intangible assets (0.2)%Productivity (1) 1.2 %Fiscal 2018 60.7 % (1) Productivity includes overall manufacturing-related costs, such as component costs, warranty expense, provision for inventory, freight, logistics, shipment volume, and other items not categorized elsewhere.Product gross margin decreased by 0.9 percentage points due largely to unfavorable impacts from product pricing, a charge of $127 million to product cost of sales recorded in fiscal 2018 related to legal and indemnification settlements, and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by productivity benefits. The negative pricing impact, which was lower than the year-over-year impact we experienced in fiscal 2017, was driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets. While productivity was positive to overall product gross margin, the benefit was lower than the prior year as these improvements were adversely impacted by an increase in the costs of certain components which are currently constrained. We expect the higher component costs to continue to impact productivity in the near term. Productivity improvements were driven by cost reductions including value engineering efforts (e.g. component redesign, board configuration, test processes, and transformation processes), lower warranty expenses and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations. The decrease in product gross margin was also due to an unfavorable mix of products sold driven by negative mix impacts from our Infrastructure Platforms products, partially offset by favorability from Security, Applications and Other Products. Our product gross margin in fiscal 2018 was also negatively impacted by higher amortization expense from purchased intangible assets. Fiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016The following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017: Product Gross Margin PercentageFiscal 2016 62.0 %Product pricing (2.1)%Mix of products sold (0.3)%Supplier component remediation adjustment (0.1)%Other (0.1)%Productivity (1) 1.4 %SP Video CPE Business impact 0.8 %Fiscal 2017 61.6 %Product gross margin decreased by 0.4 percentage points as compared with fiscal 2016. The decrease in product gross margin was largely due to unfavorable impacts from product pricing, lower productivity benefits, and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by a benefit from the divestiture of the lower margin SP Video CPE business in fiscal 2016. 45Table of ContentsThe negative pricing impact was driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets. While productivity was positive to overall product gross margin, the benefit was lower than the prior year as these improvements were adversely impacted by an increase in the cost of certain memory components. In addition, productivity was negatively impacted by decreases in core routing and switching revenue which limited our ability to generate cost savings. Productivity improvements were driven by value engineering efforts (e.g. component redesign, board configuration, test processes, and transformation processes), lower warranty expenses and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations. The decrease in product gross margin was also due to an unfavorable mix of products sold driven by negative mix impacts from our Infrastructure platform products.Service Gross MarginFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017Our service gross margin percentage decreased by 0.8 percentage points due to increased headcount-related costs and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable mix and increased delivery costs. These cost impacts were partially offset by the resulting benefit to gross margin of higher sales volume in both advanced services and technical support services.Our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. Other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services.Fiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016Our service gross margin percentage increased by 1.2 percentage points due to higher sales volume, decreased delivery costs, favorable mix and, to a lesser extent, lower share-based compensation expense. These benefits to service gross margin were partially offset by increased headcount-related costs.Gross Margin by SegmentThe following table presents the total gross margin for each segment (in millions, except percentages): AMOUNT PERCENTAGEYears Ended July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016Gross margin: Americas $18,792 $18,284 $18,986 64.6% 64.5% 64.6%EMEA 7,945 7,855 7,998 63.9% 65.4% 65.0%APJC 4,726 4,741 4,620 60.3% 62.0% 61.2%Segment total 31,463 30,880 31,604 63.8% 64.3% 64.2%Unallocated corporate items (1) (857) (656) (644) Total $30,606 $30,224 $30,960 62.0% 63.0% 62.9%Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. (1) The unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges. We do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments. Fiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017We experienced a slight gross margin percentage increase in our Americas segment due to productivity improvements, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing and product mix. The unfavorable mix of products sold in this segment was driven by negative mix impacts from our Infrastructure Platforms products, partially offset by favorability from Security, Applications and Other products. The gross margin percentage decrease in our EMEA segment was due primarily to negative impacts from pricing and, to a lesser extent, an unfavorable product mix, partially offset by productivity improvements. Lower service gross margin also contributed to the decrease in the gross margin in this geographic segment.46Table of ContentsThe APJC segment gross margin percentage decreased due primarily to the negative impacts from pricing and an unfavorable product mix, partially offset by productivity improvements. Lower service gross margin also contributed to the decrease in the gross margin in this geographic segment. Our gross margin in this segment was also negatively impacted by specific transactions with service providers.The gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment. Fiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016The Americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage decrease due to negative impacts from pricing and product mix, partially offset by productivity improvements and the sale of the lower margin SP Video CPE Business. The unfavorable mix impact was driven by Infrastructure Platforms products. The gross margin percentage increase in our EMEA segment was due primarily to higher service gross margin. Product gross margin in this segment also increased slightly due to the impact of productivity improvements, the sale of the lower margin SP Video CPE Business and a favorable product mix, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing.The APJC segment gross margin percentage increased due primarily to higher service gross margin. Product gross margin in this segment decreased due to negative impacts from pricing and product mix, partially offset by productivity improvements. The unfavorable mix impact was driven by Infrastructure Platforms products. Research and Development (“R&D”), Sales and Marketing, and General and Administrative (“G&A”) ExpensesR&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses are summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentResearch and development $6,332 $6,059 $6,296 $273 5% $(237) (4)%Percentage of revenue 12.8% 12.6% 12.8% Sales and marketing 9,242 9,184 9,619 58 1% (435) (5)%Percentage of revenue 18.7% 19.1% 19.5% General and administrative 2,144 1,993 1,814 151 8% 179 10 %Percentage of revenue 4.3% 4.2% 3.7% Total $17,718 $17,236 $17,729 $482 3% $(493) (3)%Percentage of revenue 35.9% 35.9% 36.0% Our fiscal 2016 had an extra week compared with fiscal 2017. We estimate that the extra week in fiscal 2016 contributed approximately $116 million of the year-over-year decrease in total operating expenses (not including share-based compensation expense).R&D ExpensesFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017R&D expenses increased primarily due to higher headcount-related expenses, higher discretionary spending and, to a lesser extent, higher acquisition-related costs and higher share-based compensation expense, partially offset by lower contracted services.We continue to invest in R&D in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. If we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal R&D. Fiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016R&D expenses decreased primarily due to lower contracted services, lower headcount-related expenses, lower discretionary spending and lower acquisition-related costs, partially offset by higher share-based compensation expense. Lower headcount- related expenses were due to efficiencies related to our restructuring actions and the extra week in fiscal 2016.47Table of ContentsSales and Marketing ExpensesFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017Sales and marketing expenses increased due to increases in headcount-related expenses, discretionary spending, share-based compensation expense and acquisition-related costs, partially offset by a decrease in contracted services.Fiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016Sales and marketing expenses decreased due to lower headcount-related expenses, lower contracted services, lower discretionary spending, lower acquisition-related costs and, to a lesser extent, lower share-based compensation expense. Lower headcount-related expenses were due to efficiencies related to our restructuring actions. The extra week in fiscal 2016 also contributed to the decrease in headcount-related expenses.G&A ExpensesFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017G&A expenses increased due to increases in contracted services, headcount-related expenses, discretionary spending, acquisition-related/divestiture costs and share-based compensation expense, partially offset by gains on divestitures. Fiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016G&A expenses increased primarily due to the $253 million pre-tax gain from the sale of our SP Video CPE Business recorded during fiscal 2016 and, to a lesser extent, higher share-based compensation expense. These increases were partially offset by lower headcount-related expenses and lower contracted services. The extra week in fiscal 2016 contributed to the decreased headcount-related expense.Effect of Foreign CurrencyIn fiscal 2018, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, increased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $93 million, or 0.5%, compared with fiscal 2017. In fiscal 2017, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $77 million, or 0.4%, compared with fiscal 2016.

We expect this restructuring plan to be substantially completed in fiscal 2019. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We incurred restructuring and other charges of $358 million during fiscal 2018, $108 million of which was related to the restructuring plan initiated during fiscal 2018 and the remainder of which was related to the restructuring plan announced in August 2016. We incurred restructuring and other charges of $756 million and $266 million during fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, in connection with the restructuring plans announced in August 2016 and August 2014. These charges were primarily cash-based and consisted of employee severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other associated costs. We expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from these restructuring actions in our key priority areas. As a result, the overall cost savings from these restructuring actions are not expected to be material for future periods.Operating IncomeThe following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016Operating income $12,309 $11,973 $12,660Operating income as a percentage of revenue 25.0% 24.9% 25.7%Fiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017Operating income increased by 3%, and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 0.1 percentage points. These increases resulted primarily from an increase in revenue and a decrease in restructuring and other charges.49Table of ContentsFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016Operating income decreased by 5%, and as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased by 0.8 percentage points. These decreases resulted primarily from an increase in restructuring and other charges related to the restructuring action announced in August 2016 and the $253 million pre-tax gain from the sale of our SP Video CPE Business recorded in fiscal 2016.Interest and Other Income (Loss), NetInterest Income (Expense), Net The following table summarizes interest income and interest expense (in millions): Years Ended 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 Variance in Dollars Variance in DollarsInterest income$1,508 $1,338 $1,005 $170 $333Interest expense(943) (861) (676) (82) (185)Interest income (expense), net$565 $477 $329 $88 $148Fiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017Interest income increased driven by higher yields on our portfolio. The increase in interest expense was driven by the impact of higher effective interest rates. Fiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016Interest income increased driven by an increase in our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and fixed income investments as well as higher yields on our portfolio. The increase in interest expense was driven by higher average debt balances, which includes commercial paper notes, and the impact of higher effective interest rates on floating-rate senior notes and interest rate swaps associated with fixed-rate senior notes. Other Income (Loss), Net The components of other income (loss), net, are summarized as follows (in millions): Years Ended 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016 Variance in Dollars Variance in DollarsGains (losses) on investments, net: Publicly traded equity securities$529 $(45) $33 $574 $(78)Fixed income securities(242) (42) (34) (200) (8)Total available-for-sale investments287 (87) (1) 374 (86)Privately held companies11 (46) (35) 57 (11)Net gains (losses) on investments298 (133) (36) 431 (97)Other gains (losses), net(133) (30) (33) (103) 3Other income (loss), net$165 $(163) $(69) $328 $(94)Fiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017The change in total net gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments was primarily attributable to higher realized gains on publicly traded equity securities and lower impairment charges on publicly traded equity securities, partially offset by higher realized losses on fixed income securities as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities. The change in net gains (losses) on investments in privately held companies was primarily due to lower impairment charges partially offset by lower realized gains on investments in privately held companies. The change in other gains (losses), net was primarily driven by higher donation expense, net unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and impacts from equity derivatives.50Table of ContentsFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016The change in total net gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments was driven by $74 million of impairment charges on publicly traded equity securities. The change in net gains (losses) on investments in privately held companies was primarily due to higher impairment charges on investments in privately held companies, partially offset by higher realized gains on investments in privately held companies.The change in other gains (losses), net was driven by lower donation expense partially offset by impacts from customer lease terminations, foreign exchange and equity derivatives.Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 99.2% for fiscal 2018, compared with 21.8% for fiscal 2017. The net 77.4 percentage point increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the mandatory one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, foreign withholding tax, and DTA re-measurement during fiscal 2018.During fiscal 2018, we recorded a provisional tax expense of $10.4 billion related to the Tax Act, comprised of $8.1 billion of U.S. transition tax, $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax, and $1.1 billion re-measurement of net DTA. We plan to pay the transition tax in installments over eight years in accordance with the Tax Act. The Tax Act is discussed more fully in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.As a result of the adoption of the new accounting standard on share-based compensation in fiscal 2018, our effective tax rate will increase or decrease based upon the tax effect of the difference between the share-based compensation expenses and the benefits taken on the company's tax returns. We recognize excess tax benefits on a discrete basis and therefore anticipate the effective tax rate to vary from quarter to quarter depending on our share price in each period.For a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 27% and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Fiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 21.8% for fiscal 2017, compared with 16.9% for fiscal 2016. The net 4.9 percentage point increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the recognition of a net benefit to the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2016 related to our settlement with the IRS of all outstanding items covering fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010 and reinstatement of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit on December 18, 2015.51Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowsCash and Cash Equivalents and Investments The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments (in millions): July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 Increase (Decrease)Cash and cash equivalents$8,934 $11,708 $(2,774)Fixed income securities37,009 57,077 (20,068)Publicly traded equity securities605 1,707 (1,102)Total$46,548 $70,492 $(23,944)The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by cash returned to shareholders in the form of repurchases of common stock of $17.5 billion under the stock repurchase program and cash dividends of $6.0 billion, net decrease in debt of $8.0 billion, net cash paid for acquisitions of $3.0 billion, the timing of settlements of investments and other of $2.0 billion, and capital expenditures of $0.8 billion. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $13.7 billion.In fiscal 2018, we repatriated $70 billion of foreign subsidiary earnings to the U.S. (in the form of cash, cash equivalents, or investments), and paid foreign withholding tax of $1.2 billion. We also paid approximately $125 million of other one-time foreign taxes as a result of the Tax Act. Future repatriation of cash and other property held by our foreign subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax. As we evaluate the impact of the Tax Act and the future cash needs of our global operations, we may revise the amount of foreign earnings considered to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries. In addition to cash requirements in the normal course of business, on August 2, 2018 we announced our intent to acquire Duo Security, Inc. for a purchase consideration of approximately $2.35 billion in cash and assumed equity awards. See further discussion of liquidity and future payments under “Contractual Obligations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements” below.We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our fixed income investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below.Free Cash Flow and Capital Allocation As part of our capital allocation strategy, we intend to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment. The following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions):Years EndedJuly 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 July 30, 2016Net cash provided by operating activities$13,666 $13,876 $13,570Acquisition of property and equipment(834) (964) (1,146)Free cash flow$12,832 $12,912 $12,424We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. For additional discussion, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report.52Table of ContentsWe consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net income provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do. The following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases (in millions, except per-share amounts): DIVIDENDS STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM TOTALYears Ended Per Share Amount Shares Weighted-Average Price per Share Amount AmountJuly 28, 2018 $1.24 $5,968 432 $40.88 $17,661 $23,629July 29, 2017 $1.10 $5,511 118 $31.38 $3,706 $9,217July 30, 2016 $0.94 $4,750 148 $26.45 $3,918 $8,668Any future dividends are subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. On February 14, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a $25 billion increase to the stock repurchase program. The remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program, including the additional authorization, is approximately $19.0 billion, with no termination date. We expect to utilize this remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases over the next 12 to 18 months. The purchase price for the shares of our stock repurchased is reflected as a reduction to shareholders’ equity. We are required to allocate the purchase price of the repurchased shares as (i) a reduction to retained earnings and (ii) a reduction of common stock and additional paid-in capital. As a result of future stock repurchases, we may report an accumulated deficit in future periods in shareholders’ equity.Accounts Receivable, Net The following table summarizes our accounts receivable, net (in millions): July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 Increase (Decrease)Accounts receivable, net$5,554 $5,146 $408Our accounts receivable net, as of July 28, 2018 increased by approximately 8% compared with the end of fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher product billings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.Inventory Supply Chain The following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in millions): July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 Increase (Decrease)Inventories$1,846 $1,616 $230Inventory as of July 28, 2018 increased by 14% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2017. The increase in inventory was due to an increase in raw materials due to securing memory supply which is currently constrained and also higher levels of manufactured finished goods in support of current order activity. Our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods. Distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers. Manufactured finished goods consist primarily of build-to-order and build-to-stock products.We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. 53Table of ContentsOur purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure long-term pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. We believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts. The following table summarizes our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers as of the respective period ends (in millions):Commitments by PeriodJuly 28, 2018 July 29, 2017Less than 1 year$5,407 $4,6201 to 3 years710 203 to 5 years360 —Total$6,477 $4,640Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by approximately 40% compared to the end of fiscal 2017. On a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by 33% compared with the end of fiscal 2017. Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels.Financing Receivables and Guarantees The following table summarizes our financing receivables (in millions): July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 Increase (Decrease)Lease receivables, net$2,576 $2,650 $(74)Loan receivables, net4,939 4,457 482Financed service contracts, net2,316 2,487 (171)Total, net$9,831 $9,594 $237Financing Receivables Our financing arrangements include leases, loans, and financed service contracts. Lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware, software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We also provide financing to certain qualified customers for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services. The majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed. Financing receivables increased by 2%. We expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term.Financing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. 54Table of ContentsThe volume of channel partner financing was $28.2 billion, $27.0 billion, and $26.9 billion in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $953 million and $1.0 billion as of July 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017, respectively. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. As of July 28, 2018, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $308 million, of which approximately $122 million was recorded as deferred revenue.BorrowingsSenior Notes The following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes (in millions): Maturity Date July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 Senior notes: Floating-rate notes: Three-month LIBOR plus 0.60%February 21, 2018 $— $1,000 Three-month LIBOR plus 0.31%June 15, 2018 — 900 Three-month LIBOR plus 0.50%March 1, 2019 500 500 Three-month LIBOR plus 0.34%September 20, 2019 500 500 Fixed-rate notes: 1.40%February 28, 2018 — 1,250 1.65%June 15, 2018 — 1,600 4.95%February 15, 2019 2,000 2,000 1.60%February 28, 2019 1,000 1,000 2.125%March 1, 2019 1,750 1,750 1.40%September 20, 2019 1,500 1,500 4.45%January 15, 2020 2,500 2,500 2.45%June 15, 2020 1,500 1,500 2.20%February 28, 2021 2,500 2,500 2.90%March 4, 2021 500 500 1.85%September 20, 2021 2,000 2,000 3.00%June 15, 2022 500 500 2.60%February 28, 2023 500 500 2.20%September 20, 2023 750 750 3.625%March 4, 2024 1,000 1,000 3.50%June 15, 2025 500 500 2.95%February 28, 2026 750 750 2.50%September 20, 2026 1,500 1,500 5.90%February 15, 2039 2,000 2,000 5.50%January 15, 2040 2,000 2,000 Total $25,750 $30,500 Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable quarterly on the floating-rate notes. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of July 28, 2018.Commercial Paper We have a short-term debt financing program in which up to $10.0 billion is available through the issuance of commercial paper notes. We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper notes and $3.2 billion in commercial paper notes outstanding as of July 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017, respectively.55Table of ContentsCredit Facility On May 15, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on May 15, 2020. Any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the highest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time, or (c) LIBOR, or a comparable or successor rate that is approved by the Administrative Agent (“Eurocurrency Rate”), for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, or (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate, plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., provided that in no event will the Eurocurrency Rate be less than zero. We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and/or extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to May 15, 2022. This credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement. As of July 28, 2018, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility. Deferred Revenue The following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue (in millions): July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 Increase (Decrease)Service$11,431 $11,302 $129Product: Deferred revenue related to recurring software and subscription offers6,120 4,971 1,149Other product deferred revenue2,134 2,221 (87)Total product deferred revenue8,254 7,192 1,062 Total$19,685 $18,494 $1,191Reported as: Current$11,490 $10,821 $669Noncurrent8,195 7,673 522 Total$19,685 $18,494 $1,191Total deferred revenue increased 6% in fiscal 2018. Deferred product revenue increased 15% primarily due to product deferred revenue related to recurring software and subscription offers, which grew 23% on a year-over-year basis to $6.1 billion. Deferred service revenue increased 1%, driven by the impact of contract renewals, partially offset by amortization of deferred service revenue. Contractual Obligations The impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. In addition, we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at July 28, 2018 (in millions): PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIODJuly 28, 2018Total Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 YearsOperating leases$1,220 $392 $483 $234 $111Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers6,477 5,407 710 360 —Other purchase obligations2,192 956 976 125 135Senior notes25,750 5,250 9,000 3,000 8,500Transition tax payable8,094 787 1,302 1,302 4,703Other long-term liabilities1,293 — 264 168 861Total by period$45,026 $12,792 $12,735 $5,189 $14,310Other long-term liabilities (uncertainty in the timing of future payments)1,419 Total$46,445 Operating Leases For more information on our operating leases, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.56Table of ContentsPurchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure long-term pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. A significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in “Inventory Supply Chain.” As of July 28, 2018, the liability for these purchase commitments was $159 million and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table.Other Purchase Obligations Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations. Long-Term Debt The amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Transition Tax Payable In connection with the Tax Act, we recorded an income tax payable of $8.1 billion for the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Amounts associated with the Tax Act are considered provisional and may be subject to further adjustment during the measurement period. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $1,278 million and deferred tax liabilities of $141 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other CommitmentsIn connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $223 million as of July 28, 2018, compared with $216 million as of July 29, 2017.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements. In the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies including venture funds and provide financing to certain customers. Certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings, and we have determined that as of July 28, 2018 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities.On an ongoing basis, we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing Receivables and Guarantees.”Liquidity and Capital Resource RequirementsBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, pending acquisitions, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources. 57Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskOur financial position is exposed to a variety of risks, including interest rate risk, equity price risk, and foreign currency exchange risk.Interest Rate RiskFixed Income Securities We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk. At any time, a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates, including the impact from lower credit spreads, could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives. We had no outstanding hedging instruments for our fixed income securities as of July 28, 2018. Our fixed income investments are held for purposes other than trading. Our fixed income investments are not leveraged as of July 28, 2018. We monitor our interest rate and credit risks, including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong. The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our fixed income securities, including the hedging effects when applicable, as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates. The market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (“BPS”), plus 100 BPS, and plus 150 BPS. The hypothetical fair values as of July 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017 are as follows (in millions): VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTS FAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 28, 2018 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPSFixed income securities$37,786 $37,527 $37,268 $37,009 $36,750 $36,491 $36,231 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTS FAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 29, 2017 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPSFixed income securities$58,728 $58,177 $57,627 $57,077 $56,527 $55,977 $55,426Financing Receivables As of July 28, 2018, our financing receivables had a carrying value of $9.8 billion, compared with $9.6 billion as of July 29, 2017. As of July 28, 2018, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.1 billion, respectively. Debt As of July 28, 2018, we had $25.8 billion in principal amount of senior notes outstanding, which consisted of $1.0 billion in floating-rate notes and $24.8 billion in fixed-rate notes. The carrying amount of the senior notes was $25.6 billion, and the related fair value based on market prices was $26.4 billion. As of July 28, 2018, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed-rate debt, excluding the $6.8 billion of hedged debt, by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.5 billion, respectively. However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed-rate debt that is not hedged.Equity Price RiskThe fair value of our equity investments in publicly traded companies is subject to market price volatility. We may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio. Our equity portfolio consists of securities with characteristics that most closely match the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index or Nasdaq Composite Index. These equity securities are held for purposes other than trading. To manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain equity securities, we may enter into equity derivatives designated as hedging instruments.Publicly Traded Equity Securities The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of publicly traded equity securities as a result of selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each equity security in the portfolio, excluding hedged equity securities, if any. Potential fluctuations in the price of each equity security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 20%, and 30% were selected based on potential near-term changes in those security prices. 58Table of ContentsThe hypothetical fair values as of July 28, 2018 and July 29, 2017 are as follows (in millions): VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN X% DECREASE INEACH STOCK’S PRICE FAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 28, 2018 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN X% INCREASE INEACH STOCK’S PRICE (30)% (20)% (10)% 10% 20% 30%Publicly traded equity securities$424 $484 $545 $605 $666 $726 $787 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN X% DECREASE INEACH STOCK’S PRICE FAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 29, 2017 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN X% INCREASE INEACH STOCK’S PRICE (30)% (20)% (10)% 10% 20% 30%Publicly traded equity securities$1,195 $1,366 $1,536 $1,707 $1,878 $2,048 $2,219Investments in Privately Held Companies We have also invested in privately held companies. These investments are recorded in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are accounted for using primarily either the cost or the equity method. As of July 28, 2018, the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was $1,096 million, compared with $983 million at July 29, 2017. Some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including, among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return. Foreign Currency Exchange RiskOur foreign exchange forward and option contracts outstanding at fiscal year-end are summarized in U.S. dollar equivalents as follows (in millions): July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair ValueForward contracts: Purchased$1,850 $(2) $2,562 $39Sold$845 $2 $729 $(2)Option contracts: Purchased$— $— $528 $7Sold$— $— $486 $(1)We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations.Approximately 70% of our operating expenses are U.S.-dollar denominated. In fiscal 2018, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, increased our combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $93 million, or 0.5%, as compared with fiscal 2017. In fiscal 2017, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased our combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $77 million, or 0.4%, as compared with fiscal 2016. To reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by non-U.S.-dollar denominated operating expenses and costs, we may hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts. These hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons. In designing a specific hedging approach, we consider several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of exposures, costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument, and potential effectiveness of the hedge. The gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales.We also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities. The market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables, investments, and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances. We do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for speculative purposes.59Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:09:28.613247

See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for impact of this adoption on our operating results in fiscal 2019.(1) During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we completed the sale of our SPVSS business. As a result, revenue from this business will not recur in future periods. Includes SPVSS business revenue of $0 and $206 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $168 million and $903 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. (2) Includes a $0.9 billion charge and a $0.9 billion benefit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, and charges of $0.9 billion and $10.4 billion for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to the Tax Act. NM - Not meaningful31Table of ContentsFiscal 2019 Compared with Fiscal 2018In fiscal 2019, we had strong performance across the business and delivered growth in revenue, margins, net income, earnings per share and operating cash flow. We remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we believe that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities. Our product revenue reflected growth in Infrastructure Platforms, Applications and Security, and we continued to make progress in the transition of our business model to increased software and subscriptions. Notwithstanding the fiscal 2019 results, we continue to operate in a challenging and highly competitive environment. We expect ongoing uncertainty in the service provider customer market. While the overall environment remains uncertain, we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term. Total revenue increased by 5% compared with fiscal 2018. Within total revenue, product revenue increased 6% and service revenue increased by 2%. In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, on October 28, 2018, we completed the sale of our SPVSS business. Total revenue for fiscal 2019 increased 7% not including revenue from the SPVSS business for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018. Total gross margin increased by 0.9 percentage points, driven primarily by productivity benefits partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing and mix. Our gross margin also benefited from the sale of our lower margin SPVSS business during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and the $127 million legal and indemnification settlement charge recorded in fiscal 2018. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, decreased by 1.3 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 2.4 percentage points. Net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 included the one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, foreign withholding taxes, and re-measurement of net deferred tax assets and liabilities as related to the Tax Act. In terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the Americas increased by $1.9 billion, driven in large part by product revenue growth in the United States. EMEA revenue increased by $0.7 billion and revenue in our APJC segment increased slightly. The “BRICM” countries experienced a product revenue decline of 1% in the aggregate, driven by a 16% decrease in product revenue in China. This decrease was partially offset by increased product revenue in Mexico, Russia and India of 26%, 6%, and 5%, respectively.From a customer market standpoint, we experienced product revenue growth in the enterprise, public sector and commercial markets, partially offset by a product revenue decline in the service provider market. From a product category perspective, total product revenue, not including SPVSS products in the prior year, increased 8% year over year. The increase was driven by growth in Security and Applications of 16% and 15%, respectively. We also experienced a 7% product revenue increase in Infrastructure Platforms. 32Table of ContentsFourth Quarter SnapshotFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, total revenue increased by 5%. Within total revenue, product revenue increased by 5% and service revenue increased by 3%. With regard to our geographic segment performance, on a year-over-year basis, revenue in the Americas and EMEA increased by 8% and 4%, respectively, while revenue in APJC decreased by 5%. From a product category perspective, we experienced broad strength across the portfolio. We experienced weakness in the service provider market due to ongoing uncertainty in that market. Total gross margin increased by 2.2 percentage points, driven by improved productivity benefits and favorable product mix partially offset by unfavorable pricing. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively increased by 0.6 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 1.4 percentage points. Diluted earnings per share decreased by 37% and net income decreased by 42%, due to a $0.9 billion tax charge and $0.9 billion tax benefit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to the Tax Act. Strategy and Priorities As our customers add billions of new connections to their enterprises, and as more applications move to a multicloud environment, the network continues to be extremely critical. We believe that our customers are looking for intent-based networks that provide meaningful business value through automation, security, and analytics across private, hybrid, and multicloud environments. Our vision is to deliver highly secure, software-defined, automated and intelligent platforms for our customers. Our strategic priorities include the following: accelerating our pace of innovation, increasing the value of the network, and transforming our business model.For a full discussion of our strategy and priorities, see “Item 1. Business.”Other Key Financial MeasuresThe following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 (in millions): Fiscal 2019 Fiscal 2018Cash and cash equivalents and investments $33,413 $46,548Cash provided by operating activities $15,831 $13,666Deferred revenue (1) $18,467 $19,685Repurchases of common stock—stock repurchase program $20,577 $17,661Dividends $5,979 $5,968Inventories $1,383 $1,846(1) Deferred revenue decreased primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606 in the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2019. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact of this adoption.33Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition. ASC 606 supersedes nearly all U.S. GAAP on revenue recognition and eliminated industry-specific guidance. The underlying principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services at an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. ASC 606 allowed two methods of adoption: i) retrospectively to each prior period presented (“full retrospective method”), or ii) retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized in retained earnings as of the date of adoption (“modified retrospective method”). At the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method to those contracts that were not completed as of July 28, 2018. ASC 606 primarily impacted our revenue recognition for software arrangements and sales to two-tier distributors. In both areas, the new standard accelerates the recognition of revenue. We enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We classify our hardware, perpetual software licenses, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes.Revenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices (SSP). SSP is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We apply judgment in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration includes various rebate, cooperative marketing, potential penalties and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, partners and customers. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. We also consider the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. If actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.See Notes 2 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. 34Table of ContentsAllowances for Receivables and Sales ReturnsThe allowances for receivables were as follows (in millions, except percentages): July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018Allowance for doubtful accounts $136 $129Percentage of gross accounts receivable 2.4% 2.3%Allowance for credit loss—lease receivables $46 $135Percentage of gross lease receivables (1) 1.8% 4.7%Allowance for credit loss—loan receivables $71 $60Percentage of gross loan receivables 1.3% 1.2%(1) Calculated as allowance for credit loss on lease receivables as a percentage of gross lease receivables and residual value before unearned income.The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience, credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay as well as historical and expected default frequency rates, which are published by major third-party credit-rating agencies and are updated on a quarterly basis. We also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts. If a major customer’s creditworthiness deteriorates, if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, or if other circumstances arise, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, and additional allowances could be required, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.The allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis. When evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis, we consider historical experience, credit quality and age of receivable balances, and economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. When evaluating financing receivables on a collective basis, we use expected default frequency rates published by a major third-party credit-rating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default, while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions, concentration of risk and correlation. Determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings, as well as assessing factors such as economic conditions, concentration of risk, and correlation, are complex and subjective. Our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results. Both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible.A reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. The reserve for future sales returns as of July 27, 2019 and July 28, 2018 was $84 million and $123 million, respectively, and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue. If the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established, our revenue could be adversely affected. Inventory Valuation and Liability for Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and SuppliersInventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories, determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of our cost of sales. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory.Our provision for inventory was $77 million, $63 million, and $74 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was $95 million, $105 million, and $124 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we could be required to increase our inventory write-downs, and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and accordingly our profitability, could be adversely affected. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments.35Table of ContentsLoss Contingencies and Product WarrantiesWe are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.Our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years, and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty. We accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs, technical support labor costs, and associated overhead. Material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment. Technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period. Overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities.If we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected, our profitability could be adversely affected.Impairment of Investments We recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our available-for-sale debt investments below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary. The ultimate value realized on these securities, to the extent unhedged, is subject to market price volatility until they are sold.If the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary. An impairment is considered other than temporary if (i) we have the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on (i) or (ii) described in the prior sentence, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (iii), the amount representing credit loss, defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security, will be recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). In estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected, we consider all available information, including past events, current conditions, the remaining payment terms of the security, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults, and the value of underlying collateral.We hold non-marketable equity and other investments, some of which are in startup or development stage companies. As of July 27, 2019, our non-marketable equity and other investments were $1.2 billion, compared with $1.1 billion as of July 28, 2018, and were included in other assets. We monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment, and we make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required, based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Asset ImpairmentsOur methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.36Table of ContentsThe goodwill recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 27, 2019 and July 28, 2018 was $33.5 billion and $31.7 billion, respectively. The increase in goodwill during fiscal 2019 was due in large part to our acquisition of Duo Security, Inc. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017. For the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2019, the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was $69.2 billion for the Americas, $56.3 billion for EMEA, and $32.2 billion for APJC. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. The fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. We consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets was approximately $47 million for fiscal 2017. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R&D tax credits, domestic manufacturing deductions, foreign-derived intangible income deductions, global intangible low-taxed income, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, international realignments, and transfer pricing adjustments. Our effective tax rate was 20.2%, 99.2%, and 21.8% in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted. The Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate income tax rate (“federal tax rate”) from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, implementing a modified territorial tax system, and imposing a mandatory one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the Tax Act enactment, we recorded a provisional tax expense of $10.4 billion in fiscal 2018. The provisional tax expense included an $863 million benefit associated with the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends in the transition fiscal year. As previously disclosed, the benefit could be subject to reduction or elimination by subsequent government action. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we recorded an $872 million charge, which was the reversal of the previously recorded benefit associated with the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends recorded in fiscal 2018, as a result of a retroactive final U.S. Treasury regulation issued during the quarter. The total tax charge as a result of the Tax Act was $11.3 billion, consisting of $9 billion of tax expense for the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax, and $1.1 billion of tax expense for DTA re-measurement. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred 37Table of Contentstax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction, foreign-derived intangible income deduction, global intangible low-tax income, and base erosion and anti-abuse tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 36 countries, including the United States, has made changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. As a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. 38Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 28, 2018, filed with the SEC on September 6, 2018, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations website at investor.cisco.com. RevenueThe following table presents the breakdown of revenue between product and service (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2019 vs. 2018 July 27, 2019 (1) July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentRevenue: Product $39,005 $36,709 $35,705 $2,296 6%Percentage of revenue 75.1% 74.4% 74.4% Service 12,899 12,621 12,300 278 2%Percentage of revenue 24.9% 25.6% 25.6% Total $51,904 $49,330 $48,005 $2,574 5%(1) Total revenue, product revenue and service revenue not including the SPVSS business in the prior year increased 7%, 8% and 3%, respectively. We manage our business on a geographic basis, organized into three geographic segments. Our revenue, which includes product and service for each segment, is summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2019 vs. 2018 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentRevenue: Americas $30,927 $29,070 $28,351 $1,857 6%Percentage of revenue 59.6% 58.9% 59.1% EMEA 13,100 12,425 12,004 675 5%Percentage of revenue 25.2% 25.2% 25.0% APJC 7,877 7,834 7,650 43 1%Percentage of revenue 15.2% 15.9% 15.9% Total $51,904 $49,330 $48,005 $2,574 5%Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. Total revenue in fiscal 2019 increased by 5% compared with fiscal 2018. Product revenue increased by 6% and service revenue increased by 2%. Our total revenue reflected growth across each of our geographic segments. Product revenue for the BRICM countries, in the aggregate, experienced 1% product revenue decline, driven by a 16% decrease in product revenue in China and a decrease of 1% in Brazil. These decreases were partially offset by increased product revenue in Mexico, Russia and India of 26%, 6% and 5%, respectively.In addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced IT spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple performance obligations; the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment. 39Table of ContentsProduct Revenue by SegmentThe following table presents the breakdown of product revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2019 vs. 2018 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentProduct revenue: Americas $22,754 $21,088 $20,487 $1,666 8%Percentage of product revenue 58.3% 57.5% 57.4% EMEA 10,246 9,671 9,369 575 6%Percentage of product revenue 26.3% 26.3% 26.2% APJC 6,005 5,950 5,849 55 1%Percentage of product revenue 15.4% 16.2% 16.4% Total $39,005 $36,709 $35,705 $2,296 6%Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. AmericasProduct revenue in the Americas segment increased by 8%, driven by growth in the enterprise, public sector and commercial markets. These increases were partially offset by a product revenue decline in the service provider market. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 9% in the United States, 26% in Mexico and 6% in Canada, partially offset by a product revenue decrease of 1% in Brazil. EMEAThe increase in product revenue in the EMEA segment of 6% was driven by growth in the public sector and enterprise markets, partially offset by a decline in the service provider market. Product revenue in the commercial market was flat. Product revenue from emerging countries within EMEA increased by 9%, and product revenue for the remainder of the EMEA segment increased by 5%.APJCProduct revenue in the APJC segment increased by 1%, driven by growth in the public sector and enterprise markets, partially offset by declines in the service provider and commercial markets. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 9% in Japan and 5% in India, partially offset by a product revenue decrease of 16% in China.Product Revenue by Groups of Similar ProductsIn addition to the primary view on a geographic basis, we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes. We report our product revenue in the following categories: Infrastructure Platforms, Applications, Security, and Other Products. This aligns our product categories with our evolving business model. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.The following table presents revenue for groups of similar products (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2019 vs. 2018 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentProduct revenue: Infrastructure Platforms $30,191 $28,322 $27,817 $1,869 7 %Applications 5,803 5,036 4,568 767 15 %Security 2,730 2,352 2,152 378 16 %Other Products 281 999 1,168 (718) (72)%Total $39,005 $36,709 $35,705 $2,296 6 %Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. 40Table of ContentsInfrastructure PlatformsThe Infrastructure Platforms product category represents our core networking offerings related to switching, routing, wireless, and the data center. Infrastructure Platforms revenue increased by 7%, or $1,869 million, with growth across the portfolio. Switching had solid growth, with strong revenue growth in campus switching driven by an increase in sales of our intent-based networking Catalyst 9000 Series, and with growth in data center switching driven by increased revenue from our ACI portfolio. Routing experienced modest revenue growth driven by an increase in sales of SD-WAN products, partially offset by weakness in the service provider market. We experienced double digit revenue growth from wireless products driven by increases across the portfolio. Revenue from data center increased driven by higher sales of HyperFlex and our server products. ApplicationsThe Applications product category includes our collaboration offerings (unified communications, Cisco TelePresence and conferencing) as well as IoT and AppDynamics analytics software offerings. Revenue in our Applications product category increased by 15%, or $767 million, with double digit growth in unified communications, TelePresence, AppDynamics, and IoT software.SecurityRevenue in our Security product category increased 16%, or $378 million, driven by higher sales of identity and access, advanced threat security, unified threat management and web security products. The Duo acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 also contributed to the revenue increase in this product category.Other ProductsThe decrease in revenue from our Other Products category was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue from SPVSS business which we divested on October 28, 2018.Service Revenue by SegmentThe following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2019 vs. 2018Years EndedJuly 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentService revenue: Americas$8,173 $7,982 $7,864 $191 2 %Percentage of service revenue63.4% 63.3% 63.9% EMEA2,854 2,754 2,635 100 4 %Percentage of service revenue22.1% 21.8% 21.4% APJC1,872 1,885 1,801 (13) (1)%Percentage of service revenue14.5% 14.9% 14.7% Total$12,899 $12,621 $12,300 $278 2 %Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding.

Our product gross margin also benefited from the sale of our lower margin SPVSS business during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Productivity improvements were driven by cost reductions including value engineering efforts (e.g. component redesign, board configuration, test processes and transformation processes) and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations. The negative pricing impact, which was lower than the year-over-year impact we experienced in fiscal 2018, was driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets. The unfavorable product mix impact was driven by our products within the Infrastructure Platforms product category. Our product gross margin also benefited from the $127 million charge to product cost of sales recorded in fiscal 2018 related to legal and indemnification settlements.Service Gross MarginOur service gross margin percentage increased by 0.1 percentage point due to higher sales volume, partially offset by increased headcount-related and delivery costs.Our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. Other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services.Gross Margin by SegmentThe following table presents the total gross margin for each segment (in millions, except percentages): AMOUNT PERCENTAGEYears Ended July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017Gross margin: Americas $20,338 $18,792 $18,284 65.8% 64.6% 64.5%EMEA 8,457 7,945 7,855 64.6% 63.9% 65.4%APJC 4,683 4,726 4,741 59.5% 60.3% 62.0%Segment total 33,479 31,463 30,880 64.5% 63.8% 64.3%Unallocated corporate items (1) (813) (857) (656) Total $32,666 $30,606 $30,224 62.9% 62.0% 63.0% (1) The unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges. We do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments. Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. 42Table of ContentsWe experienced a gross margin percentage increase in our Americas segment due to productivity improvements, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing and product mix. The unfavorable product mix impact was driven by products within the Infrastructure Platforms product category. Our gross margin in this segment also benefited from the sale of our lower margin SPVSS business during the second quarter of fiscal 2019.Product gross margin in our EMEA segment increased due to productivity improvements, partially offset by negative impacts from pricing and mix. The APJC segment gross margin percentage decrease was due to negative impacts from pricing, partially offset by productivity improvements and favorable product mix. Lower service gross margin also contributed to the decrease in the gross margin in this geographic segment.The gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment. Research and Development (“R&D”), Sales and Marketing, and General and Administrative (“G&A”) ExpensesR&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses are summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2019 vs. 2018 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentResearch and development $6,577 $6,332 $6,059 $245 4 %Percentage of revenue 12.7% 12.8% 12.6% Sales and marketing 9,571 9,242 9,184 329 4 %Percentage of revenue 18.4% 18.7% 19.1% General and administrative 1,827 2,144 1,993 (317) (15)%Percentage of revenue 3.5% 4.3% 4.2% Total $17,975 $17,718 $17,236 $257 1 %Percentage of revenue 34.6% 35.9% 35.9% R&D ExpensesR&D expenses increased due to higher headcount-related expenses and, to a lesser extent, higher acquisition-related costs, higher contracted services and higher discretionary spending.We continue to invest in R&D in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. If we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal R&D. Sales and Marketing ExpensesSales and marketing expenses increased due to higher headcount-related expenses, higher discretionary spending and, to a lesser extent, higher contracted services and higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by lower share-based compensation expense.G&A ExpensesG&A expenses decreased due to a benefit from the $400 million litigation settlement with Arista Networks and lower contracted services, partially offset by higher discretionary spending and higher headcount-related expenses. Effect of Foreign CurrencyIn fiscal 2019, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $233 million, or 1.3%, compared with fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2018, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, increased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $93 million, or 0.5%, compared with fiscal 2017. 43Table of ContentsAmortization of Purchased Intangible AssetsThe following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets (in millions):Years Ended July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017Amortization of purchased intangible assets: Cost of sales $624 $640 $556Operating expenses Amortization of purchased intangible assets 150 221 259Restructuring and other charges — — 38Total $774 $861 $853The decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets was due largely to the purchased intangible assets related to the divestiture of SPVSS business on October 28, 2018, partially offset by amortization from our recent acquisitions.Restructuring and Other ChargesThe following table presents the restructuring and other charges (in millions):Years Ended July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017Restructuring and other charges included in operating expenses $322 $358 $756We initiated a restructuring plan during fiscal 2018 in order to realign our organization and enable further investment in key priority areas, with estimated pretax charges of $600 million. In connection with this restructuring plan, we incurred charges of $322 million during fiscal 2019, and have incurred cumulative charges of $430 million. We expect this restructuring plan to be substantially completed in the first half of fiscal 2020.These charges were primarily cash-based and consisted of employee severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other associated costs. We expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from these restructuring actions in our key priority areas. As a result, the overall cost savings from these restructuring actions are not expected to be material for future periods.Operating IncomeThe following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017Operating income $14,219 $12,309 $11,973Operating income as a percentage of revenue 27.4% 25.0% 24.9%Operating income increased by 16%, and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 2.4 percentage points. These increases resulted primarily from: a revenue increase, a gross margin percentage increase, a benefit from the $400 million litigation settlement with Arista in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and lower restructuring and other charges.44Table of ContentsInterest and Other Income (Loss), NetInterest Income (Expense), Net The following table summarizes interest income and interest expense (in millions): Years Ended 2019 vs. 2018 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 Variance in DollarsInterest income$1,308 $1,508 $1,338 $(200)Interest expense(859) (943) (861) 84Interest income (expense), net$449 $565 $477 $(116)Interest income decreased, driven by a decrease in the average balance of cash and available-for-sale debt investments. The decrease in interest expense was driven by a lower average debt balance, partially offset by the impact of higher effective interest rates. Other Income (Loss), Net The components of other income (loss), net, are summarized as follows (in millions): Years Ended 2019 vs. 2018 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017 Variance in DollarsGains (losses) on investments, net: Available-for-sale debt investments$(13) $(242) $(42) $229Marketable equity investments(3) 529 (45) (532)Non-marketable equity and other investments6 11 (46) (5)Net gains (losses) on investments(10) 298 (133) (308)Other gains (losses), net(87) (133) (30) 46Other income (loss), net$(97) $165 $(163) $(262)The total change in net gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt investments was primarily attributable to lower realized losses as a result of market conditions, and the timing of sales of these investments.The total change in net gains (losses) on marketable equity investments was attributable to market value fluctuations and the timing of recognition of gains and losses.The change in net gains (losses) on non-marketable equity and other investments was primarily due to lower realized gains, partially offset by higher unrealized gains.The change in other gains (losses), net was primarily driven by higher donation expense in the prior year.Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 20.2% for fiscal 2019, compared with 99.2% for fiscal 2018. The net 79.0 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the $10.4 billion mandatory one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, foreign withholding tax, and DTA re-measurement recorded during fiscal 2018.As a result of the adoption of the new accounting standard on share-based compensation in fiscal 2018, our effective tax rate will increase or decrease based upon the tax effect of the difference between the share-based compensation expenses and the benefits taken on the company's tax returns. We recognize excess tax benefits on a discrete basis and therefore anticipate the effective tax rate to vary from quarter to quarter depending on our share price in each period.For a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.45Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowsCash and Cash Equivalents and Investments The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments (in millions): July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 Increase (Decrease)Cash and cash equivalents$11,750 $8,934 $2,816Available-for-sale debt investments21,660 37,009 (15,349)Marketable equity securities3 605 (602)Total$33,413 $46,548 $(13,135)The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by cash returned to shareholders in the form of repurchases of common stock of $20.7 billion under the stock repurchase program and cash dividends of $6.0 billion, net cash paid for acquisitions and divestitures of $2.2 billion, a net decrease in debt of $1.1 billion, and capital expenditures of $0.9 billion. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $15.8 billion and the timing of settlements of investments and other of $2.0 billion.In addition to cash requirements in the normal course of business, on July 9, 2019 we announced our intent to acquire Acacia Communications, Inc. (“Acacia”) for a purchase consideration of approximately $2.6 billion in cash. Additionally, $0.7 billion of the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries, $6.0 billion of long-term debt and $4.2 billion of commercial paper notes outstanding at July 27, 2019, are payable within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date. See further discussion of liquidity and future payments under “Contractual Obligations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements” below.We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below.Free Cash Flow and Capital Allocation As part of our capital allocation strategy, we intend to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment. The following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions):Years EndedJuly 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 29, 2017Net cash provided by operating activities$15,831 $13,666 $13,876Acquisition of property and equipment(909) (834) (964)Free cash flow$14,922 $12,832 $12,912We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. For additional discussion, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report.We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not 46Table of Contentsrepresent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do. The following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases (in millions, except per-share amounts): DIVIDENDS STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM TOTALYears Ended Per Share Amount Shares Weighted-Average Price per Share Amount AmountJuly 27, 2019 $1.36 $5,979 418 $49.22 $20,577 $26,556July 28, 2018 $1.24 $5,968 432 $40.88 $17,661 $23,629July 29, 2017 $1.10 $5,511 118 $31.38 $3,706 $9,217Any future dividends are subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. On February 13, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a $15 billion increase to the stock repurchase program. The remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program, including the additional authorization, is approximately $13.5 billion, with no termination date. Accounts Receivable, Net The following table summarizes our accounts receivable, net (in millions): July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 Increase (Decrease)Accounts receivable, net$5,491 $5,554 $(63)Our accounts receivable net, as of July 27, 2019 decreased by approximately 1% compared with the end of fiscal 2018.Inventory Supply Chain The following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in millions): July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 Increase (Decrease)Inventories$1,383 $1,846 $(463)Inventory as of July 27, 2019 decreased by 25% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2018. The decrease in inventory was due primarily to lower deferred cost of sales related to the adoption of ASC 606 in the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2019.We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure long-term pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. We believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts. 47Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers as of the respective period ends (in millions):Commitments by PeriodJuly 27, 2019 July 28, 2018Less than 1 year$4,239 $5,4071 to 3 years728 7103 to 5 years— 360Total$4,967 $6,477Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by approximately 23% compared to the end of fiscal 2018. On a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by 24% compared with the end of fiscal 2018. Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels.Financing Receivables and Guarantees The following table summarizes our financing receivables (in millions): July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 Increase (Decrease)Lease receivables, net$2,326 $2,576 $(250)Loan receivables, net5,367 4,939 428Financed service contracts, net2,360 2,316 44Total, net$10,053 $9,831 $222Financing Receivables Our financing arrangements include leases, loans, and financed service contracts. Lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware, software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We also provide financing to certain qualified customers for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services. The majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed. Financing receivables increased by 2%. We expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term.Financing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. The volume of channel partner financing was $29.6 billion, $28.2 billion, and $27.0 billion in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion as of July 27, 2019 and July 28, 2018, respectively. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. As of July 27, 2019, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $218 million, of which approximately $77 million was recorded as deferred revenue.48Table of ContentsBorrowingsSenior Notes The following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes (in millions): Maturity Date July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 Senior notes: Floating-rate notes: Three-month LIBOR plus 0.50%March 1, 2019 $— $500 Three-month LIBOR plus 0.34%September 20, 2019 500 500 Fixed-rate notes: 4.95%February 15, 2019 — 2,000 1.60%February 28, 2019 — 1,000 2.125%March 1, 2019 — 1,750 1.40%September 20, 2019 1,500 1,500 4.45%January 15, 2020 2,500 2,500 2.45%June 15, 2020 1,500 1,500 2.20%February 28, 2021 2,500 2,500 2.90%March 4, 2021 500 500 1.85%September 20, 2021 2,000 2,000 3.00%June 15, 2022 500 500 2.60%February 28, 2023 500 500 2.20%September 20, 2023 750 750 3.625%March 4, 2024 1,000 1,000 3.50%June 15, 2025 500 500 2.95%February 28, 2026 750 750 2.50%September 20, 2026 1,500 1,500 5.90%February 15, 2039 2,000 2,000 5.50%January 15, 2040 2,000 2,000 Total $20,500 $25,750 Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable quarterly on the floating-rate notes. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of July 27, 2019.Commercial Paper We have a short-term debt financing program in which up to $10.0 billion is available through the issuance of commercial paper notes. We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. We had $4.2 billion in commercial paper notes outstanding as of July 27, 2019 and no commercial paper notes outstanding as of July 28, 2018.Credit Facility On May 15, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on May 15, 2020. Any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the highest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time, or (c) LIBOR, or a comparable or successor rate that is approved by the Administrative Agent (“Eurocurrency Rate”), for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, or (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate, plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., provided that in no event will the Eurocurrency Rate be less than zero. We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and/or extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to May 15, 2022. This credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement. As of July 27, 2019, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility. 49Table of ContentsDeferred Revenue The following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue (in millions): July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 Increase (Decrease)Service$11,709 $11,431 $278Product6,758 8,254 (1,496) Total$18,467 $19,685 $(1,218)Reported as: Current$10,668 $11,490 $(822)Noncurrent7,799 8,195 (396) Total$18,467 $19,685 $(1,218)Deferred revenue decreased primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606 in the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2019. Of the total deferred revenue decrease related to the adoption of ASC 606 of $2.8 billion, $2.6 billion relates to deferred product revenue and $0.2 billion relates to deferred service revenue. Of the adjustment to deferred product revenue, $1.3 billion related to our recurring software and subscription offers, $0.6 billion related to two-tier distribution, and the remainder related to non-recurring software and other adjustments. The decrease related to the adoption of ASC 606 was partially offset by an increase in product deferred revenue during the fiscal year. The increase in deferred service revenue was driven by the impact of contract renewals, partially offset by amortization of deferred service revenue. Contractual Obligations The impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. In addition, we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at July 27, 2019 (in millions): PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIODJuly 27, 2019Total Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 YearsOperating leases$1,179 $441 $494 $190 $54Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers4,967 4,239 728 — —Other purchase obligations1,490 676 622 98 94Senior notes20,500 6,000 5,500 2,250 6,750Transition tax payable8,343 749 1,498 2,113 3,983Other long-term liabilities1,214 — 220 136 858Total by period$37,693 $12,105 $9,062 $4,787 $11,739Other long-term liabilities (uncertainty in the timing of future payments)1,428 Total$39,121 Operating Leases For more information on our operating leases, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure long-term pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. A significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in “Inventory Supply Chain.” As of July 27, 2019, the liability for these purchase commitments was $129 million and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table.Other Purchase Obligations Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations. 50Table of ContentsLong-Term Debt The amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Transition Tax Payable Transition tax payable represents future cash tax payments associated with the one-time U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as a result of the Tax Act. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $1.3 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $95 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other CommitmentsIn connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our non-marketable equity and other investments, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $326 million as of July 27, 2019, compared with $223 million as of July 28, 2018.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements. In the ordinary course of business, we have non-marketable equity and other investments and provide financing to certain customers. Certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our non-marketable equity and other investments and customer financings, and we have determined that as of July 27, 2019 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities.On an ongoing basis, we reassess our non-marketable equity and other investments and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing Receivables and Guarantees.”Liquidity and Capital Resource RequirementsBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, pending acquisitions, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources. 51Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskOur financial position is exposed to a variety of risks, including interest rate risk, equity price risk, and foreign currency exchange risk.Interest Rate RiskAvailable-for-Sale Debt Investments We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our primary objective for holding available-for-sale debt investments is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk. At any time, a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates, including the impact from lower credit spreads, could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives. We had no outstanding hedging instruments for our available-for-sale debt investments as of July 27, 2019. Our available-for-sale debt investments are held for purposes other than trading. Our available-for-sale debt investments are not leveraged as of July 27, 2019. We monitor our interest rate and credit risks, including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong.The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our available-for-sale debt investments, including the hedging effects when applicable, as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates. The market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), plus 100 BPS, and plus 150 BPS. The hypothetical fair values as of July 27, 2019 and July 28, 2018 are as follows (in millions): VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTS FAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 27, 2019 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPSAvailable-for-sale debt investments$22,017 $21,898 $21,779 $21,660 $21,541 $21,421 $21,302 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTS FAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 28, 2018 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPSAvailable-for-sale debt investments$37,786 $37,527 $37,268 $37,009 $36,750 $36,491 $36,231Financing Receivables As of July 27, 2019, our financing receivables had a carrying value of $10.1 billion, compared with $9.8 billion as of July 28, 2018. As of July 27, 2019, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.1 billion, respectively. Debt As of July 27, 2019, we had $20.5 billion in principal amount of senior notes outstanding, which consisted of $0.5 billion in floating-rate notes and $20.0 billion in fixed-rate notes. The carrying amount of the senior notes was $20.5 billion, and the related fair value based on market prices was $22.1 billion. As of July 27, 2019, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed-rate debt, excluding the $4.5 billion of hedged debt, by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.5 billion, respectively. However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed-rate debt that is not hedged.Equity Price RiskMarketable Equity Investments The fair value of our marketable equity investments is subject to market price volatility. We may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio. These equity securities are held for purposes other than trading. As of July 27, 2019, the total fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities was $3 million. Non-marketable Equity and Other Investments These investments are recorded in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of July 27, 2019, the total carrying amount of our non-marketable equity and other investments was $1.2 billion, compared with $1.1 billion at July 28, 2018. Some of these companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of non-marketable equity and other investments is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including, among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return. 52Table of ContentsForeign Currency Exchange RiskOur foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at fiscal year-end are summarized in U.S. dollar equivalents as follows (in millions): July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair ValueForward contracts: Purchased$2,239 $14 $1,850 $(2)Sold$1,441 $(14) $845 $2At July 27, 2019 and July 28, 2018, we had no option contracts outstanding. We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations.Approximately 70% of our operating expenses are U.S.-dollar denominated. In fiscal 2019, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased our combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $233 million, or 1.3%, as compared with fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2018, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, increased our combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $93 million, or 0.5%, as compared with fiscal 2017. To reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by non-U.S.-dollar denominated operating expenses and costs, we may hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts. These hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons. In designing a specific hedging approach, we consider several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of exposures, costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument, and potential effectiveness of the hedge. The gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales.We also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities. The market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables, investments, and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances. We do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for speculative purposes.53Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:09:28.808062

(2) Includes a $0.9 billion charge for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2019 related to the Tax Act. 33Table of ContentsFiscal 2020 Compared with Fiscal 2019In fiscal 2020, we delivered growth in margins and earnings per share in a very challenging environment with the COVID-19 pandemic. Total revenue decreased by 5% compared with fiscal 2019. Our product revenue declined in Infrastructure Platforms and Applications, partially offset by growth in Security, and we continued to make progress in the transition of our business model to increased software and subscriptions. We remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we believe that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities. We continue to operate in a challenging macroeconomic and highly competitive environment. We saw broad-based weakening in the global macroeconomic environment during the fiscal year which impacted our commercial and enterprise markets. We also experienced continuing weakness in the service provider market and emerging countries, and we expect ongoing uncertainty in these markets. While the overall environment remains uncertain, we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term. Within total revenue, product revenue decreased 8% and service revenue increased by 3%. Total gross margin increased by 1.4 percentage points, driven primarily by productivity benefits and product mix partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, increased by 0.8 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 0.2 percentage points. Diluted earnings per share increased by 1%, driven by a decrease in diluted share count of 199 million shares, partially offset by a decrease in net income of 4%. In terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the Americas decreased by $1.6 billion, driven in large part by a product revenue decline in the United States. EMEA revenue decreased by $0.4 billion and revenue in our APJC segment decreased by $0.5 billion. The “BRICM” countries experienced a product revenue decline of 25% in the aggregate, driven by decreased product revenue in the emerging countries of India, China, Mexico and Brazil.From a customer market standpoint, we experienced product revenue declines across all customer segments, with the most significant declines in the commercial and service provider markets. During fiscal 2020, we saw a decline in business momentum in the commercial and enterprise markets, which we believe was significantly related to weakness in the global macroeconomic environment.From a product category perspective, total product revenue decreased 8% year over year. The decrease was driven by declines in revenue in Infrastructure Platforms and Applications of 10% and 4%, respectively. These declines were partially offset by a product revenue increase in Security of 12%. 34Table of ContentsFourth Quarter SnapshotFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, total revenue decreased by 9%. Within total revenue, product revenue decreased by 13% and service revenue was flat. With regard to our geographic segment performance, on a year-over-year basis, revenue in the Americas, EMEA and APJC decreased by 12%, 6% and 7% respectively. From a product category perspective, we experienced product revenue declines in Infrastructure Platforms and Applications, offset by growth in Security. Total gross margin decreased by 0.7 percentage points, driven by unfavorable pricing partially offset by favorable product mix. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively decreased by 0.6 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 0.8 percentage points. Diluted earnings per share increased by 22% and net income increased by 19%. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 included a $0.9 billion tax charge related to the Tax Act. COVID-19 Pandemic Response SummaryDuring this extraordinary time, our priority has been supporting our employees, customers, partners and communities, while positioning Cisco for the future. The pandemic has driven organizations across the globe to digitize their operations and support remote workforces at a faster speed and greater scale than ever before. We remain focused on providing the technology and solutions our customers need to accelerate their digital organizations. The actions we are taking include:Employees•Most of our global workforce working from home.•Seamless transition to work from home with a long-standing flexible work policy, and we build the technologies that allow organizations to stay connected, secure and productive.•For the remainder who must be in the office to perform their roles, we are focused on their health and safety, and are taking all of the necessary precautions.Customer and Partners•Introduced a variety of free offers and trials for our Webex and security technologies as they dramatically shifted entire workforces to be remote.•Announced a Cisco Capital Business Resiliency Program leveraging currently available funds to provide organizations with access to financing solutions to offer financial flexibility and support business continuity. This will help customers and partners access the technology they need now, invest for recovery, and defer most of the payments until early 2021.Communities•Committed significant funds to support both global and local pandemic response efforts.•Providing technology and financial support for non-profits, first responders, and governments.•Donating personal protective equipment to hospital workers including N95 masks and face shields 3D-printed by Cisco volunteers around the world.Strategy and Priorities As our customers add billions of new connections to their enterprises, and as more applications move to a multicloud environment, the network becomes even more critical. Our customers are navigating change at an unprecedented pace and our mission is to inspire new possibilities for them by helping transform their infrastructure, expand applications and analytics, address their security needs, and empower their teams. We believe that our customers are looking for intent-based networks that provide meaningful business value through automation, security, and analytics across private, hybrid, and multicloud environments. Our vision is to deliver highly secure, software-defined, automated and intelligent platforms for our customers.For a full discussion of our strategy and priorities, see “Item 1. Business.”Other Key Financial MeasuresThe following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019 (in millions): Fiscal 2020 Fiscal 2019Cash and cash equivalents and investments $29,419 $33,413Cash provided by operating activities $15,426 $15,831Deferred revenue $20,446 $18,467Repurchases of common stock—stock repurchase program $2,619 $20,577Dividends $6,016 $5,979Inventories $1,282 $1,38335Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.The inputs into certain of our judgments, assumptions and estimates considered the economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our critical and significant accounting estimates. The COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our significant judgments, assumptions and estimates that are reflected in our results for fiscal 2020. These estimates include: goodwill and identified purchased intangible assets and income taxes, among other items. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods.Revenue Recognition We enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We classify our hardware, perpetual software licenses, and SaaS as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes.Revenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices (SSP). SSP is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We apply judgment in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and various rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, channel partners and customers. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. We also consider the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. If actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. 36Table of ContentsLoss ContingenciesWe are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Asset ImpairmentsOur methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018. For the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2020, the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was $72.8 billion for the Americas, $51.6 billion for EMEA, and $31.3 billion for APJC. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. The fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. We consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R&D tax credits, domestic manufacturing deductions, foreign-derived intangible income deductions, global intangible low-taxed income, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, international realignments, and transfer pricing adjustments. Our effective tax rate was 19.7%, 20.2%, and 99.2% in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.During fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, we recorded a total tax charge of $11.3 billion, consisting of $9 billion of tax expense for the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax, and $1.1 billion of tax expense for DTA re-measurement as a result of the Tax Act. 37Table of ContentsSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction, foreign-derived intangible income deduction, global intangible low-tax income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 37 countries, including the United States, has made changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. As a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. 38Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 27, 2019, filed with the SEC on September 5, 2019, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations website at investor.cisco.com. RevenueThe following table presents the breakdown of revenue between product and service (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2020 vs. 2019 July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent (1)Revenue: Product $35,978 $39,005 $36,709 $(3,027) (8)%Percentage of revenue 73.0% 75.1% 74.4% Service 13,323 12,899 12,621 424 3 %Percentage of revenue 27.0% 24.9% 25.6% Total $49,301 $51,904 $49,330 $(2,603) (5)%(1) Total revenue and product revenue not including the SPVSS business in the prior year decreased 5% and 7%, respectively. Service revenue not including the SPVSS business in the prior year increased 3%. We manage our business primarily on a geographic basis, organized into three geographic segments. Our revenue, which includes product and service for each segment, is summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2020 vs. 2019 July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentRevenue: Americas $29,291 $30,927 $29,070 $(1,636) (5)%Percentage of revenue 59.4% 59.6% 58.9% EMEA 12,659 13,100 12,425 (441) (3)%Percentage of revenue 25.7% 25.2% 25.2% APJC 7,352 7,877 7,834 (525) (7)%Percentage of revenue 14.9% 15.2% 15.9% Total $49,301 $51,904 $49,330 $(2,603) (5)%Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. Total revenue in fiscal 2020 decreased by 5% compared with fiscal 2019. Product revenue decreased by 8% and service revenue increased by 3%. Our total revenue reflected declines across each of our geographic segments. Product revenue for the emerging countries of BRICM, in the aggregate, experienced a 25% product revenue decline, with decreases in India, China, Mexico and Brazil.In addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced IT spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple performance obligations; the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment. 39Table of ContentsProduct Revenue by SegmentThe following table presents the breakdown of product revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2020 vs. 2019 July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentProduct revenue: Americas $21,006 $22,754 $21,088 $(1,748) (8)%Percentage of product revenue 58.4% 58.3% 57.5% EMEA 9,647 10,246 9,671 (599) (6)%Percentage of product revenue 26.8% 26.3% 26.3% APJC 5,326 6,005 5,950 (679) (11)%Percentage of product revenue 14.8% 15.4% 16.2% Total $35,978 $39,005 $36,709 $(3,027) (8)%Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. AmericasProduct revenue in the Americas segment decreased by 8%. The product revenue decrease was across all of our customer segments. From a country perspective, product revenue decreased by 7% in the United States, 13% in Canada, 27% in Mexico and 14% in Brazil. EMEAThe decrease in product revenue in the EMEA segment of 6% was driven by declines in the service provider, commercial and enterprise markets, partially offset by growth in the public sector market. Product revenue from emerging countries within EMEA decreased by 4%, and product revenue for the remainder of the EMEA segment, which primarily consists of countries in Western Europe, decreased by 6%. From a country perspective, product revenue decreased in the United Kingdom and France by 12% and 7%, respectively, partially offset by a product revenue increase of 2% in Germany.APJCProduct revenue in the APJC segment decreased by 11%, driven by declines across all of our customer segments. From a country perspective, product revenue decreased in Australia, India and China by 16%, 29% and 34%, respectively, partially offset by a product revenue increase of 8% in Japan.40Table of ContentsProduct Revenue by Groups of Similar ProductsIn addition to the primary view on a geographic basis, we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes. We report our product revenue in the following categories: Infrastructure Platforms, Applications, Security, and Other Products. This aligns our product categories with our evolving business model. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.The following table presents revenue for groups of similar products (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2020 vs. 2019 July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentProduct revenue: Infrastructure Platforms $27,122 $30,099 $28,286 $(2,977) (10)%Applications 5,568 5,803 5,036 (235) (4)%Security 3,154 2,821 2,388 333 12 %Other Products 135 281 999 (146) (52)%Total $35,978 $39,005 $36,709 $(3,027) (8)%Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. Infrastructure PlatformsThe Infrastructure Platforms product category represents our core networking offerings related to switching, routing, wireless, and the data center. Infrastructure Platforms revenue decreased by 10%, or $3.0 billion. This was the product area most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic environment in the second half of fiscal 2020. Switching revenue declined in both campus switching and data center switching, although we had revenue growth in our intent-based networking Catalyst 9000 Series. We experienced a decrease in sales of routing products, with declines primarily in the service provider and enterprise markets. Revenue from wireless products declined, although we saw revenue growth in our Meraki and WiFi6 products. Revenue from data center declined driven by continued market contraction impacting primarily our servers products.ApplicationsThe Applications product category includes our collaboration offerings (unified communications, Cisco TelePresence and conferencing) as well as IoT and AppDynamics analytics software offerings. Revenue in our Applications product category decreased by 4%, or $235 million, with a decline in Unified Communications and Cisco TelePresence partially offset by double digit growth in AppDynamics and growth in IoT software offerings and Webex.SecurityRevenue in our Security product category increased 12%, or $333 million, driven by higher sales of identity and access, advanced threat security, unified threat management and web security products. Revenue from our cloud security portfolio reflected strong double-digit growth and continued momentum with our Duo and Umbrella offerings.Other ProductsThe decrease in revenue from our Other Products category was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue from the SPVSS business which we divested in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.41Table of ContentsService Revenue by SegmentThe following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2020 vs. 2019Years EndedJuly 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentService revenue: Americas$8,285 $8,173 $7,982 $112 1%Percentage of service revenue62.2% 63.4% 63.3% EMEA3,012 2,854 2,754 158 6%Percentage of service revenue22.6% 22.1% 21.8% APJC2,026 1,872 1,885 154 8%Percentage of service revenue15.2% 14.5% 14.9% Total$13,323 $12,899 $12,621 $424 3%Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding.

In the second half of fiscal 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we incurred additional logistics costs, such as freight which had a negative impact on product gross margin. Our product gross margin benefited slightly from the sale of our lower margin SPVSS business during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Productivity improvements were driven by memory cost savings and other cost reductions including value engineering efforts (e.g. component redesign, board configuration, test processes and transformation processes) and continued operational efficiency 42Table of Contentsin manufacturing operations. The negative pricing impact, which was higher than the year-over-year impact we experienced in fiscal 2019, was driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments. The favorable product mix impact was driven by impacts from each of our product categories. Service Gross MarginOur service gross margin percentage increased by 0.7 percentage point primarily due to higher sales volume.Our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. Other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services.Gross Margin by SegmentThe following table presents the total gross margin for each segment (in millions, except percentages): AMOUNT PERCENTAGEYears Ended July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018Gross margin: Americas $19,547 $20,338 $18,792 66.7% 65.8% 64.6%EMEA 8,304 8,457 7,945 65.6% 64.6% 63.9%APJC 4,688 4,683 4,726 63.8% 59.5% 60.3%Segment total 32,538 33,479 31,463 66.0% 64.5% 63.8%Unallocated corporate items (1) (855) (813) (857) Total $31,683 $32,666 $30,606 64.3% 62.9% 62.0% (1) The unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges. We do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments. Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. We experienced a gross margin percentage increase in our Americas segment due to productivity improvements and favorable product mix, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing. Product gross margin in our EMEA segment increased due to productivity improvements and, to a lesser extent, favorable product mix, partially offset by negative impacts from pricing. The APJC segment gross margin percentage increase was due to productivity improvements and favorable product mix, partially offset by negative impacts from pricing. Higher service gross margin also contributed to the increase in the gross margin in this geographic segment.The gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment. 43Table of ContentsResearch and Development (“R&D”), Sales and Marketing, and General and Administrative (“G&A”) ExpensesR&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses are summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended 2020 vs. 2019 July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 Variance in Dollars Variance in PercentResearch and development $6,347 $6,577 $6,332 $(230) (3)%Percentage of revenue 12.9% 12.7% 12.8% Sales and marketing 9,169 9,571 9,242 (402) (4)%Percentage of revenue 18.6% 18.4% 18.7% General and administrative 1,925 1,827 2,144 98 5 %Percentage of revenue 3.9% 3.5% 4.3% Total $17,441 $17,975 $17,718 $(534) (3)%Percentage of revenue 35.4% 34.6% 35.9% R&D ExpensesR&D expenses decreased due to lower headcount-related expenses, lower discretionary spending and lower contracted services spending, partially offset by higher share-based compensation expense.We continue to invest in R&D in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. If we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal R&D. Sales and Marketing ExpensesSales and marketing expenses decreased primarily due to lower discretionary spending and contracted services spending.G&A ExpensesG&A expenses increased due to the benefit from the $400 million litigation settlement with Arista Networks, Inc. (“Arista”) in fiscal 2019 and higher discretionary spending, partially offset by gains recognized on the sale of property that had been held for sale, lower headcount-related expenses, lower contracted services spending, and lower share-based compensation expense. Effect of Foreign CurrencyIn fiscal 2020, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $141 million, or 0.8%, compared with fiscal 2019. Amortization of Purchased Intangible AssetsThe following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets (in millions):Years Ended July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018Amortization of purchased intangible assets: Cost of sales $659 $624 $640Operating expenses 141 150 221Total $800 $774 $861The increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets was due largely to the amortization of purchased intangibles from our recent acquisitions.44Table of ContentsRestructuring and Other ChargesIn the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we initiated a restructuring plan, which includes a voluntary early retirement program, in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas. The total pretax charges are estimated to be approximately $900 million. We expect the plan to be substantially completed in fiscal 2021 and estimate it will generate cost savings of approximately $1.0 billion on an annualized basis over the next few quarters.The following table presents restructuring and other charges (in millions):Years Ended July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018Restructuring and other charges included in operating expenses $481 $322 $358We initiated a restructuring plan during fiscal 2020 in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas, with estimated pretax charges of approximately $300 million. In connection with this restructuring plan, we incurred charges of $255 million during fiscal 2020. We expect this restructuring plan to be substantially completed in fiscal 2021.We incurred total restructuring and other charges of $481 million in fiscal 2020. We incurred charges of $255 million related to the restructuring plan initiated during fiscal 2020 and the remainder of which was related to the restructuring plan announced during fiscal 2018.These charges were primarily cash-based and consisted of employee severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other costs. We expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from these restructuring actions in our key priority areas. As a result, the overall cost savings from these restructuring actions are not expected to be material for future periods.Operating IncomeThe following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018Operating income $13,620 $14,219 $12,309Operating income as a percentage of revenue 27.6% 27.4% 25.0%Operating income decreased by 4%, and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 0.2 percentage points. These changes resulted primarily from: a revenue decrease, the impact of the benefit from the $400 million litigation settlement with Arista in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and higher restructuring and other charges, partially offset by a gross margin percentage increase (driven by productivity improvements and product mix, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing).Interest and Other Income (Loss), NetInterest Income (Expense), Net The following table summarizes interest income and interest expense (in millions): Years Ended 2020 vs. 2019 July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 Variance in DollarsInterest income$920 $1,308 $1,508 $(388)Interest expense(585) (859) (943) 274Interest income (expense), net$335 $449 $565 $(114)Interest income decreased driven by a lower average balance of cash and available-for-sale debt investments and lower interest rates. The decrease in interest expense was driven by a lower average debt balance and the impact of lower effective interest rates. 45Table of ContentsOther Income (Loss), Net The components of other income (loss), net, are summarized as follows (in millions): Years Ended 2020 vs. 2019 July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 Variance in DollarsGains (losses) on investments, net: Available-for-sale debt investments$42 $(13) $(242) $55Marketable equity investments(5) (3) 529 (2)Non-marketable equity and other investments95 6 11 89Net gains (losses) on investments132 (10) 298 142Other gains (losses), net(117) (87) (133) (30)Other income (loss), net$15 $(97) $165 $112The total change in net gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt investments was primarily attributable to higher realized gains as a result of market conditions, and the timing of sales of these investments. The change in net gains (losses) on non-marketable equity and other investments was primarily due to higher realized gains and higher unrealized gains, partially offset by higher impairment charges. The change in other gains (losses), net was primarily driven by higher donation expense as related to COVID-19 programs, partially offset by net favorable foreign exchange impacts.Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 19.7% for fiscal 2020, compared with 20.2% for fiscal 2019. The net 0.5 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in net discrete tax charges.For a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.46Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowsCash and Cash Equivalents and Investments The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments (in millions): July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 Increase (Decrease)Cash and cash equivalents$11,809 $11,750 $59Available-for-sale debt investments17,610 21,660 (4,050)Marketable equity securities— 3 (3)Total$29,419 $33,413 $(3,994)The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by a net decrease in debt of $10.2 billion, cash returned to shareholders in the form of repurchases of common stock of $2.7 billion under the stock repurchase program and cash dividends of $6.0 billion, capital expenditures of $0.8 billion and net cash paid for acquisitions and divestitures of $0.3 billion. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $15.4 billion.In addition to cash requirements in the normal course of business, on July 9, 2019 we announced our intent to acquire Acacia Communications, Inc. for a net purchase consideration of approximately $2.6 billion in cash. Additionally, approximately $0.7 billion of the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries and $3.0 billion of long-term debt outstanding at July 25, 2020 will mature within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date. See further discussion of liquidity and future payments under “Contractual Obligations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements” below.We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position is critical at this time of uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic and allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below.Securities Lending We periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale debt investments. These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. We did not experience any losses in connection with the secured lending of securities during the periods presented.Free Cash Flow and Capital Allocation As part of our capital allocation strategy, we intend to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment. The following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions):Years EndedJuly 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018Net cash provided by operating activities$15,426 $15,831 $13,666Acquisition of property and equipment(770) (909) (834)Free cash flow$14,656 $14,922 $12,832We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. For additional discussion, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report.47Table of ContentsWe consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do. The following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases (in millions, except per-share amounts): DIVIDENDS STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM TOTALYears Ended Per Share Amount Shares Weighted-Average Price per Share Amount AmountJuly 25, 2020 $1.42 $6,016 59 $44.36 $2,619 $8,635July 27, 2019 $1.36 $5,979 418 $49.22 $20,577 $26,556July 28, 2018 $1.24 $5,968 432 $40.88 $17,661 $23,629Any future dividends are subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. The remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program is approximately $10.8 billion, with no termination date. Accounts Receivable, Net The following table summarizes our accounts receivable, net (in millions): July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 Increase (Decrease)Accounts receivable, net$5,472 $5,491 $(19)Our accounts receivable net, as of July 25, 2020 was flat compared with the end of fiscal 2019. Inventory Supply Chain The following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in millions): July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 Increase (Decrease)Inventories$1,282 $1,383 $(101)Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers$4,406 $4,967 $(561)Inventory as of July 25, 2020 decreased by 7% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2019, and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by approximately 11%. On a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by 10% compared with the end of fiscal 2019. The decrease in inventory was primarily due to a decrease in finished goods and lower deferred cost of sales, partially offset by an increase in raw materials. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure long-term pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. We believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts. 48Table of ContentsInventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels.Financing Receivables and Guarantees The following table summarizes our financing receivables (in millions): July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 Increase (Decrease)Lease receivables, net$2,088 $2,326 $(238)Loan receivables, net5,856 5,367 489Financed service contracts, net2,821 2,360 461Total, net$10,765 $10,053 $712Financing Receivables Our financing arrangements include leases, loans, and financed service contracts. Lease receivables include sales-type leases. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware, software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We also provide financing to certain qualified customers for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services. The majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed. Financing receivables increased by 7%.Financing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, with payment terms generally ranging from 60 to 90 days. During fiscal 2020, we expanded the payment terms on certain of our channel partner financing programs by 30 days in response to the COVID-19 pandemic environment. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. The volume of channel partner financing was $26.9 billion, $29.6 billion, and $28.2 billion in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion as of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, respectively. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. As of July 25, 2020, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $207 million, of which approximately $28 million was recorded as deferred revenue.COVID-19 Business Resiliency Program At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we initiated a new Business Resiliency Program designed to help customers and channel partners mitigate financial challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This program includes $2.5 billion in currently available funds to provide organizations with access to financing solutions. The new Business Resiliency Program offered by us includes an up-front 90-day payment holiday and allows a customer to defer 95 percent of the payments for a new product or solution until calendar 2021, which in turn protects their business and increases their existing cash flow.49Table of ContentsBorrowingsSenior Notes The following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes (in millions): Maturity Date July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019Senior notes: Floating-rate notes: Three-month LIBOR plus 0.34%September 20, 2019 $— $500Fixed-rate notes: 1.40%September 20, 2019 — 1,5004.45%January 15, 2020 — 2,5002.45%June 15, 2020 — 1,5002.20%February 28, 2021 2,500 2,5002.90%March 4, 2021 500 5001.85%September 20, 2021 2,000 2,0003.00%June 15, 2022 500 5002.60%February 28, 2023 500 5002.20%September 20, 2023 750 7503.625%March 4, 2024 1,000 1,0003.50%June 15, 2025 500 5002.95%February 28, 2026 750 7502.50%September 20, 2026 1,500 1,5005.90%February 15, 2039 2,000 2,0005.50%January 15, 2040 2,000 2,000Total $14,500 $20,500Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of July 25, 2020.Commercial Paper We have a short-term debt financing program in which up to $10.0 billion is available through the issuance of commercial paper notes. We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper notes outstanding as of July 25, 2020. We had $4.2 billion in commercial paper notes outstanding as of July 27, 2019.Credit Facility On May 15, 2020, we entered into a 364-day credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $2.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on May 14, 2021. The credit agreement is structured as an amendment and restatement of our five-year credit facility which would have terminated on May 15, 2020, the end of its five-year term. As of July 25, 2020, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility. Any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the highest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time, or (c) LIBOR, or a comparable or successor rate that is approved by the Administrative Agent (“Eurocurrency Rate”), for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, or (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate, plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., provided that in no event will the Eurocurrency Rate be less than 0.25%. We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion. This credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement.50Table of ContentsDeferred Revenue The following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue (in millions): July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 Increase (Decrease)Service$12,551 $11,709 $842Product7,895 6,758 1,137 Total$20,446 $18,467 $1,979Reported as: Current$11,406 $10,668 $738Noncurrent9,040 7,799 1,241 Total$20,446 $18,467 $1,979Total deferred revenue increased 11% in fiscal 2020. The increase in deferred product revenue of 17% was primarily due to increased deferrals related to our recurring software offerings. The increase in deferred service revenue was driven by the impact of contract renewals, partially offset by amortization of deferred service revenue.Remaining Performance Obligations The following table presents the breakdown of remaining performance obligations (in millions): July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 Increase (Decrease)Product$11,261 $9,603 $1,658Service17,093 15,702 1,391 Total$28,354 $25,305 $3,049Total remaining performance obligations increased 12% in fiscal 2020. Remaining performance obligations for product and service increased 17% and 9%, respectively, compared to fiscal 2019.Contractual Obligations The impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. In addition, we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at July 25, 2020 (in millions): PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIODJuly 25, 2020Total Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 YearsOperating leases$1,033 $354 $439 $188 $52Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers4,406 3,994 412 — —Other purchase obligations1,226 522 423 209 72Senior notes14,500 3,000 3,000 2,250 6,250Transition tax payable7,638 727 1,455 3,183 2,273Other long-term liabilities1,405 — 358 93 954Total by period$30,208 $8,597 $6,087 $5,923 $9,601Other long-term liabilities (uncertainty in the timing of future payments)2,007 Total$32,215 Operating Leases For more information on our operating leases, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure long-term pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. A significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and 51Table of Contentsunconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in “Inventory Supply Chain.” Other Purchase Obligations Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations. Long-Term Debt The amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Transition Tax Payable Transition tax payable represents future cash tax payments associated with the one-time U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as a result of the Tax Act. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $1.9 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $81 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other CommitmentsIn connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our non-marketable equity and other investments, some of which may be based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $0.3 billion as of each of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements. In the ordinary course of business, we have non-marketable equity and other investments and provide financing to certain customers. Certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our non-marketable equity and other investments and customer financings, and we have determined that as of July 25, 2020 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities.On an ongoing basis, we reassess our non-marketable equity and other investments and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing Receivables and Guarantees.”Liquidity and Capital Resource RequirementsWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has not materially impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date, it has led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets. The pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, pending acquisitions, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources. 52Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskOur financial position is exposed to a variety of risks, including interest rate risk, equity price risk, and foreign currency exchange risk. We have seen an increase in these risks and related uncertainties with increased volatility in the financial markets in the current environment with the COVID-19 pandemic.Interest Rate RiskAvailable-for-Sale Debt Investments We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our primary objective for holding available-for-sale debt investments is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk. At any time, a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates as has also happened recently, including the impact from lower credit spreads, could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives. We had no outstanding hedging instruments for our available-for-sale debt investments as of July 25, 2020. Our available-for-sale debt investments are held for purposes other than trading. Our available-for-sale debt investments are not leveraged as of July 25, 2020. We monitor our interest rate and credit risks, including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong.The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our available-for-sale debt investments, including the hedging effects when applicable, as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates. The market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), plus 100 BPS, and plus 150 BPS. The hypothetical fair values as of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019 are as follows (in millions): VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTS FAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 25, 2020 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPSAvailable-for-sale debt investments$17,877 $17,788 $17,699 $17,610 $17,522 $17,433 $17,344 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTS FAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 27, 2019 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPSAvailable-for-sale debt investments$22,017 $21,898 $21,779 $21,660 $21,541 $21,421 $21,302Financing Receivables As of July 25, 2020, our financing receivables had a carrying value of $10.8 billion, compared with $10.1 billion as of July 27, 2019. As of July 25, 2020, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.1 billion, respectively. Debt As of July 25, 2020, we had $14.5 billion in principal amount of senior fixed-rate notes outstanding. The carrying amount of the senior notes was $14.6 billion, and the related fair value based on market prices was $17.4 billion. As of July 25, 2020, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed-rate debt, excluding the $2.5 billion of hedged debt, by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.5 billion, respectively. However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed-rate debt that is not hedged.Equity Price RiskMarketable Equity Investments The fair value of our marketable equity investments is subject to market price volatility. We may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio. These equity securities are held for purposes other than trading. We had no outstanding marketable equity securities as of July 25, 2020.Non-marketable Equity and Other Investments These investments are recorded in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of July 25, 2020, the total carrying amount of our non-marketable equity and other investments was $1.3 billion, compared with $1.2 billion at July 27, 2019. Some of these companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of non-marketable equity and other investments is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including, among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return. 53Table of ContentsForeign Currency Exchange RiskOur foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at fiscal year-end are summarized in U.S. dollar equivalents as follows (in millions): July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 Notional Amount Fair Value Notional Amount Fair ValueForward contracts: Purchased$2,441 $1 $2,239 $14Sold$1,874 $4 $1,441 $(14)At July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, we had no option contracts outstanding. We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations.Approximately 70% of our operating expenses are U.S.-dollar denominated. In fiscal 2020, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased our combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $141 million, or 0.8%, as compared with fiscal 2019. To reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by non-U.S.-dollar denominated operating expenses and costs, we may hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts. These hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons. In designing a specific hedging approach, we consider several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of exposures, costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument, and potential effectiveness of the hedge. The gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales.We also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities. The market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables, investments, and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances. We do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for speculative purposes.54Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:09:10.688957

As customers have accelerated their digitization and cloud investments stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, we focused on executing and innovating to support and assist that transition. In the second half of fiscal 2021, we began to see customers prepare for office re-openings and hybrid work by increasing investments in their technologies. Total revenue increased by 1% compared with fiscal 2020. Our product revenue reflected growth in Security, partially offset by declines in Applications. Infrastructure Platforms was flat. We continued to make progress in the transition of our business model delivering increased software and subscriptions. We remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we believe that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities. We continue to operate in a challenging macroeconomic and highly competitive environment. While the overall environment remains uncertain, we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term.Within total revenue, product revenue was flat and service revenue increased by 4%. Fiscal 2021 had 53 weeks, compared with 52 weeks in fiscal 2020, thus our results for fiscal 2021 reflect an extra week compared with fiscal 2020. We estimate that a majority of our revenue increase was attributable to the extra week. In fiscal 2021, total software revenue was $15.0 billion across all product areas and service, an increase of 7%. Within total software revenue, subscription revenue increased 15%. Total gross margin decreased by 0.3 percentage points. Product gross margin decreased by 0.2 percentage points, due to lower productivity benefits largely driven by ongoing costs related to supply chain constraints. The effect of pricing erosion was moderate. We have partnered with several of our key suppliers utilizing our volume purchasing and extending supply coverage, including revising supplier arrangements, to address supply chain challenges. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, increased by 0.7 percentage points. The total impact associated with the extra week on our cost of sales and operating expenses was approximately $150 million (excluding the impact of share-based compensation expense). Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 1.8 percentage points. We incurred restructuring and other charges of $886 million, which resulted in a decrease of 6% in net income and a decrease of 5% in diluted earnings per share. In terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the Americas decreased by $0.1 billion, EMEA revenue increased by $0.3 billion and revenue in our APJC segment increased by $0.4 billion. The “BRICM” countries experienced a product revenue decline of 6% in the aggregate, driven by a decrease in product revenue across each of the BRICM countries with the exception of India.From a customer market standpoint, we experienced product revenue growth in the public sector and service provider markets partially offset by declines in the enterprise and commercial markets. As fiscal 2021 progressed, we saw improvement in business momentum in our customer markets, which we believe was related to an improving global macroeconomic environment.From a product category perspective, total product revenue was flat year over year, driven by growth in revenue in Security of 7%, offset by a product revenue decline in Applications of 1%. Infrastructure Platforms was flat.31Table of ContentsFourth Quarter SnapshotFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, total revenue increased by 8%. Within total revenue, product revenue increased by 10% and service revenue increased by 3%. With regard to our geographic segment performance, on a year-over-year basis, revenue in the Americas, EMEA and APJC increased by 8%, 6% and 13%, respectively. From a product category perspective, we experienced product revenue growth in Infrastructure Platforms and Security, offset by declines in Applications. Total gross margin increased by 0.4 percentage points, driven by productivity benefits, and to a lesser extent, favorable product mix, partially offset by pricing erosion. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively increased by 0.5 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 0.5 percentage points. Net income increased by 14% and diluted earnings per share increased by 15%.

Business.”Other Key Financial MeasuresThe following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 (in millions): Fiscal 2021Fiscal 2020Cash and cash equivalents and investments$24,518$29,419Cash provided by operating activities$15,454$15,426Deferred revenue$22,164$20,446Repurchases of common stock—stock repurchase program$2,902$2,619Dividends paid$6,163$6,016Inventories$1,559$1,28232Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.The inputs into certain of our judgments, assumptions and estimates considered the economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our critical and significant accounting estimates. The COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our significant judgments, assumptions and estimates that are reflected in our results for fiscal 2021. These estimates include: goodwill and identified purchased intangible assets and income taxes, among other items. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods.Revenue Recognition We enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We classify our hardware, perpetual software licenses, and SaaS as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment, electronic delivery (or when the software is available for download by the customer), or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes.Revenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices (SSP). SSP is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We assess relevant contractual terms in our customer contracts to determine the transaction price. We apply judgment in identifying contractual terms and determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and various rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, channel partners and customers. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. We also consider the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. If actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. 33Table of ContentsLoss ContingenciesWe are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Asset ImpairmentsOur methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019. For the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2021, the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was $80.3 billion for the Americas, $73.0 billion for EMEA, and $33.2 billion for APJC. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. The fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. We consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R&D tax credits, foreign-derived intangible income deductions, global intangible low-taxed income, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, international realignments, and transfer pricing adjustments. Our effective tax rate was 20.1%, 19.7%, and 20.2% in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.34Table of ContentsSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to foreign-derived intangible income deduction, global intangible low-tax income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 38 countries, including the United States, has made changes and is contemplating additional changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes and any contemplated changes if finalized, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. As a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. 35Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 25, 2020, filed with the SEC on September 3, 2020.

Total revenue in fiscal 2021 increased by 1% compared with fiscal 2020. Product revenue was flat and service revenue increased by 4%. Our total revenue reflected growth in EMEA and APJC. Americas was flat. Product revenue for the emerging countries of BRICM, in the aggregate, experienced a 6% product revenue decline, with decreases in each of these countries with the exception of India.In addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including the IT spending environment and the level of spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple performance obligations; the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment. 36Table of ContentsProduct Revenue by SegmentThe following table presents the breakdown of product revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended2021 vs. 2020July 31, 2021July 25, 2020July 27, 2019Variance in DollarsVariance in PercentProduct revenue: Americas$20,688 $21,006 $22,754 $(318)(2)%Percentage of product revenue57.5 %58.4 %58.3 % EMEA9,805 9,647 10,246 158 2 %Percentage of product revenue27.2 %26.8 %26.3 % APJC5,521 5,326 6,005 195 4 %Percentage of product revenue15.3 %14.8 %15.4 % Total$36,014 $35,978 $39,005 $36 — %Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. AmericasProduct revenue in the Americas segment decreased by 2%. The product revenue decrease was driven by declines in the enterprise and commercial markets, partially offset by growth in the public sector and service provider markets. From a country perspective, product revenue decreased by 1% in the United States, 18% in Mexico, and 9% in Brazil, partially offset by a product revenue increase of 4% in Canada. EMEAThe increase in product revenue in the EMEA segment of 2% was driven by growth in the service provider and public sector markets, partially offset by declines in the commercial and enterprise markets. Product revenue from emerging countries within EMEA decreased by 7%, and product revenue for the remainder of the EMEA segment, which primarily consists of countries in Western Europe, increased by 4%. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 4% in Germany, partially offset by declines in the United Kingdom and France by 1% and 2%, respectively.APJCProduct revenue in the APJC segment increased by 4%, driven by growth in the public sector, service provider and enterprise markets, partially offset by declines in the commercial market. From a country perspective, product revenue increased in Japan, Australia and India by 11%, 6% and 3%, respectively, partially offset by a decline of 4% in China.37Table of ContentsProduct Revenue by CategoryIn addition to the primary view on a geographic basis, we also prepare financial information related to product categories and customer markets for various purposes. We report our product revenue in the following categories: Infrastructure Platforms, Applications, Security, and Other Products.The following table presents product revenue by category (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended2021 vs. 2020July 31, 2021July 25, 2020July 27, 2019Variance in DollarsVariance in PercentProduct revenue: Infrastructure Platforms$27,109 $27,219 $30,184 $(110)— %Applications5,504 5,568 5,803 (64)(1)%Security3,382 3,158 2,822 224 7 %Other Products19 33 196 (14)(43)%Total$36,014 $35,978 $39,005 $36 — %Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. Infrastructure PlatformsThe Infrastructure Platforms product category represents our core networking offerings related to switching, routing, wireless, and the data center. Infrastructure Platforms revenue was flat compared to fiscal 2020, with growth in routing and wireless, offset by declines in switching and data center. This was the product area most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic environment in the first half of fiscal 2021. Switching revenue declined in both campus switching and data center switching, although we had strong revenue growth in our Catalyst 9000 Series, Meraki switching offerings and Nexus 9000 Series. We experienced an increase in sales of routing products, with growth primarily in the service provider market. Wireless had strong growth driven by our Meraki and WiFi-6 products. Revenue from data center declined driven by continued market contraction impacting primarily our servers products.ApplicationsThe Applications product category includes our collaboration offerings (unified communications, Cisco TelePresence and conferencing) as well as IoT and AppDynamics analytics software offerings. Revenue in our Applications product category decreased by 1%, or $64 million, with a decline in Unified Communications and Cisco TelePresence partially offset by double digit growth in IoT software offerings and growth in Webex.SecurityRevenue in our Security product category increased 7%, or $224 million. Revenue from our cloud security portfolio reflected strong double-digit growth and continued momentum with our Duo and Umbrella offerings.38Table of ContentsService Revenue by SegmentThe following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended2021 vs. 2020July 31, 2021July 25, 2020July 27, 2019Variance in DollarsVariance in PercentService revenue: Americas$8,472 $8,285 $8,173 $187 2 %Percentage of service revenue61.4 %62.2 %63.4 %EMEA3,146 3,012 2,854 134 4 %Percentage of service revenue22.8 %22.6 %22.1 %APJC2,186 2,026 1,872 160 8 %Percentage of service revenue15.8 %15.2 %14.5 %Total$13,804 $13,323 $12,899 $481 4 %Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding.

The effect of pricing erosion was moderate driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments. Productivity improvements were adversely impacted by ongoing costs related to supply chain constraints. The favorable mix was driven by changes in the proportion of products sold from each of our product categories. During fiscal 2021, we continued to manage through supply chain challenges seen industry wide due to component shortages, caused in part by the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges resulted in increased costs (i.e. component costs, broker fees, 39Table of Contentsexpedited freight and overtime) which had a negative impact on product gross margin, and extended lead times to us and our customers. We have partnered with several of our key suppliers utilizing our volume purchasing and extending supply coverage, including revising supplier arrangements, to address supply chain challenges. We believe these actions will enable us to optimize our access to critical components, including semiconductors. We expect these supply chain challenges to continue through at least the first half of fiscal 2022 and potentially into the second half of fiscal 2022. Productivity improvements were driven by memory cost savings and other cost reductions including value engineering efforts (e.g. component redesign, board configuration, test processes and transformation processes) and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations.Service Gross MarginOur service gross margin percentage decreased by 0.3 percentage points primarily due to higher headcount-related and delivery costs, partially offset by higher sales volume and to a lesser extent, favorable mix of service offerings.Our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. Other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services.Gross Margin by SegmentThe following table presents the total gross margin for each segment (in millions, except percentages):AMOUNTPERCENTAGEYears EndedJuly 31, 2021July 25, 2020July 27, 2019July 31, 2021July 25, 2020July 27, 2019Gross margin:Americas$19,499 $19,547 $20,338 66.9 %66.7 %65.8 %EMEA8,466 8,304 8,457 65.4 %65.6 %64.6 %APJC4,949 4,688 4,683 64.2 %63.8 %59.5 %Segment total32,914 32,538 33,479 66.1 %66.0 %64.5 %Unallocated corporate items (1)(1,020)(855)(813)Total$31,894 $31,683 $32,666 64.0 %64.3 %62.9 % (1) The unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges. We do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments. Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. We experienced a gross margin percentage increase in our Americas segment due to favorable product mix and productivity improvements, partially offset by pricing erosion. Gross margin in our EMEA segment decreased due to pricing erosion, partially offset by productivity improvements and, to a lesser extent, favorable product mix. Lower service gross margin also contributed to the decrease in the gross margin in this geographic segment.The APJC segment gross margin percentage increase was due to productivity improvements and favorable product mix, partially offset by pricing erosion.The gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment.40Table of ContentsResearch and Development (“R&D”), Sales and Marketing, and General and Administrative (“G&A”) ExpensesR&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses are summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended2021 vs. 2020July 31, 2021July 25, 2020July 27, 2019Variance in DollarsVariance in PercentResearch and development$6,549 $6,347 $6,577 $202 3 %Percentage of revenue13.1 %12.9 %12.7 %Sales and marketing9,259 9,169 9,571 90 1 %Percentage of revenue18.6 %18.6 %18.4 %General and administrative2,152 1,925 1,827 227 12 %Percentage of revenue4.3 %3.9 %3.5 %Total$17,960 $17,441 $17,975 $519 3 %Percentage of revenue36.1 %35.4 %34.6 %Fiscal 2021 had an extra week compared to fiscal 2020. The extra week in fiscal 2021 contributed to the increase in headcount-related expenses in our R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses.R&D ExpensesR&D expenses increased due to higher headcount-related expenses, higher share-based compensation expense, higher acquisition-related costs and higher contracted services spending, partially offset by lower discretionary spending.We continue to invest in R&D in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. If we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal R&D. Sales and Marketing ExpensesSales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to higher headcount-related expenses, higher contracted services spending and higher share-based compensation expense, partially offset by lower discretionary spending. G&A ExpensesG&A expenses increased due to the impact from the gain recognized on the sale of property in fiscal 2020 and higher headcount-related expenses.Effect of Foreign CurrencyIn fiscal 2021, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, increased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $214 million, or 1.2%, compared with fiscal 2020. Amortization of Purchased Intangible AssetsThe following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets (in millions):Years EndedJuly 31, 2021July 25, 2020July 27, 2019Amortization of purchased intangible assets:Cost of sales$716 $659 $624 Operating expenses215 141 150 Total$931 $800 $774 The increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets was due largely to the amortization of purchased intangibles from our recent acquisitions.41Table of ContentsRestructuring and Other ChargesThe following table presents restructuring and other charges (in millions):Years EndedJuly 31, 2021July 25, 2020July 27, 2019Restructuring and other charges included in operating expenses$886 $481 $322 In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we initiated a restructuring plan, which included a voluntary early retirement program, in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas. The total pretax charges are estimated to be approximately $900 million. In connection with this restructuring plan, we incurred charges of $881 million during fiscal 2021. We substantially completed the Fiscal 2021 Plan in fiscal 2021 and do not expect any remaining charges related to this plan to be material. We estimate the Fiscal 2021 Plan will generate cost savings of approximately $1.0 billion on an annualized basis.We incurred total restructuring and other charges of $886 million in fiscal 2021. We incurred charges of $881 million related to the restructuring plan initiated during fiscal 2021 and the remainder of which was related to the restructuring plan announced during fiscal 2020.Operating IncomeThe following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue (in millions, except percentages):Years EndedJuly 31, 2021July 25, 2020July 27, 2019Operating income$12,833 $13,620 $14,219 Operating income as a percentage of revenue25.8 %27.6 %27.4 %Operating income decreased by 6%, and as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased by 1.8 percentage points. These changes resulted primarily from: higher restructuring and other charges and a gross margin percentage decrease (driven by pricing erosion, partially offset by productivity improvements and product mix), partially offset by a revenue increase.Interest and Other Income (Loss), NetInterest Income (Expense), Net The following table summarizes interest income and interest expense (in millions):Years Ended2021 vs. 2020July 31, 2021July 25, 2020July 27, 2019Variance in DollarsInterest income$618 $920 $1,308 $(302)Interest expense(434)(585)(859)151 Interest income (expense), net$184 $335 $449 $(151)Interest income decreased driven by lower interest rates and lower average balances of cash and available-for-sale debt investments. The decrease in interest expense was driven by a lower average debt balance and the impact of lower effective interest rates. 42Table of ContentsOther Income (Loss), Net The components of other income (loss), net, are summarized as follows (in millions):Years Ended2021 vs. 2020July 31, 2021July 25, 2020July 27, 2019Variance in DollarsGains (losses) on investments, net:Available-for-sale debt investments$53 $42 $(13)$11 Marketable equity investments6 (5)(3)11 Privately held investments266 95 6 171 Net gains (losses) on investments325 132 (10)193 Other gains (losses), net(80)(117)(87)37 Other income (loss), net$245 $15 $(97)$230 The change in net gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt investments was primarily attributable to higher realized gains as a result of market conditions, and the timing of sales of these investments. The change in net gains (losses) on marketable equity investments was attributable to market value fluctuations and the timing of recognition of gains and losses. The change in net gains (losses) on privately held investments was primarily due to higher net unrealized gains and lower impairment charges, partially offset by lower realized gains. The change in other gains (losses), net was primarily driven by lower donation expense and favorable impacts from our equity derivatives, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange.Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 20.1% for fiscal 2021, compared with 19.7% for fiscal 2020. The net 0.4 percentage points increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in the tax benefit from foreign income taxed at other than U.S. rates, offset by an increase in foreign-derived intangible income deduction and a decrease in state taxes.For a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.43Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowsCash and Cash Equivalents and Investments The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments (in millions): July 31, 2021July 25, 2020Increase (Decrease)Cash and cash equivalents$9,175 $11,809 $(2,634)Available-for-sale debt investments15,206 17,610 (2,404)Marketable equity securities137 — 137 Total$24,518 $29,419 $(4,901)The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by net cash paid for acquisitions and divestitures of $7.0 billion, cash returned to stockholders in the form of repurchases of common stock of $2.9 billion under the stock repurchase program and cash dividends of $6.2 billion, net decrease in debt of $3.0 billion, net increase in restricted cash of $0.8 billion, and capital expenditures of $0.7 billion. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $15.5 billion.In addition to cash requirements in the normal course of business, we have approximately $0.7 billion of the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries and $2.5 billion of long-term debt outstanding at July 31, 2021 that will mature within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date. See further discussion of liquidity and future payments under “Contractual Obligations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements” below.We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position is critical at this time of uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic and allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below.Securities Lending We periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale debt investments. These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. We did not experience any losses in connection with the secured lending of securities during the periods presented.Free Cash Flow and Capital Allocation As part of our capital allocation strategy, we intend to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our stockholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment. The following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions):Years EndedJuly 31, 2021July 25, 2020July 27, 2019Net cash provided by operating activities$15,454 $15,426 $15,831 Acquisition of property and equipment(692)(770)(909)Free cash flow$14,762 $14,656 $14,922 We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. For additional discussion, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report.44Table of ContentsWe consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do. The following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases (in millions, except per-share amounts):DIVIDENDSSTOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMTOTALYears EndedPer ShareAmountSharesWeighted-Average Price per ShareAmountAmountJuly 31, 2021$1.46 $6,163 64 $45.48 $2,902 $9,065 July 25, 2020$1.42 $6,016 59 $44.36 $2,619 $8,635 July 27, 2019$1.36 $5,979 418 $49.22 $20,577 $26,556 Any future dividends are subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. The remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program is approximately $7.9 billion, with no termination date. Accounts Receivable, Net The following table summarizes our accounts receivable, net (in millions): July 31, 2021July 25, 2020Increase (Decrease)Accounts receivable, net$5,766 $5,472 $294 Our accounts receivable net, as of July 31, 2021 increased by approximately 5% compared with the end of fiscal 2020. Inventory Supply Chain The following table summarizes our inventories (in millions): July 31, 2021July 25, 2020Increase (Decrease)Inventories$1,559 $1,282 $277 Inventory as of July 31, 2021 increased by 22% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2020. The increase in inventory was primarily due to an increase in raw materials, partially offset by a decrease in finished goods. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure long-term supply and pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. We believe our inventory and purchase commitments are in line with our current demand forecasts. 45Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in millions):Commitments by PeriodJuly 31, 2021July 25, 2020Less than 1 year$6,903 $3,994 1 to 3 years1,806 412 3 to 5 years1,545 — Total$10,254 $4,406 The increase in purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers compared with the end of fiscal 2020 was due to arrangements to secure long-term supply and pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. We have partnered with several of our key suppliers utilizing our volume purchasing and extending supply coverage, including revising supplier arrangements, to address supply chain challenges.Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels.Financing Receivables and Guarantees The following table summarizes our financing receivables (in millions): July 31, 2021July 25, 2020Increase (Decrease)Lease receivables, net$1,697 $2,088 $(391)Loan receivables, net5,117 5,856 (739)Financed service contracts, net2,450 2,821 (371)Total, net$9,264 $10,765 $(1,501)Financing Receivables Our financing arrangements include leases, loans, and financed service contracts. Lease receivables include sales-type leases. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware, software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We also provide financing to certain qualified customers for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services. The majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed. Financing receivables decreased by 14%.Financing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, with payment terms generally ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. The volume of channel partner financing was $26.7 billion, $26.9 billion, and $29.6 billion in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion as of July 31, 2021 and July 25, 2020, respectively. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. As of July 31, 2021, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $160 million, of which approximately $21 million was recorded as deferred revenue.46Table of ContentsBorrowingsSenior Notes The following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes (in millions): Maturity DateJuly 31, 2021July 25, 2020Senior notes:Fixed-rate notes:2.20%February 28, 2021$— $2,500 2.90%March 4, 2021— 500 1.85%September 20, 20212,000 2,000 3.00%June 15, 2022500 500 2.60%February 28, 2023500 500 2.20%September 20, 2023750 750 3.625%March 4, 20241,000 1,000 3.50%June 15, 2025500 500 2.95%February 28, 2026750 750 2.50%September 20, 20261,500 1,500 5.90%February 15, 20392,000 2,000 5.50%January 15, 20402,000 2,000 Total$11,500 $14,500 Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of July 31, 2021.Our $2.0 billion senior fixed-rate notes with a maturity date of September 20, 2021 were redeemed on August 20, 2021, pursuant to our par call redemption option. The redemption price was equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, August 20, 2021.Commercial Paper We have a short-term debt financing program in which up to $10.0 billion is available through the issuance of commercial paper notes. We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of July 31, 2021 and July 25, 2020.Credit Facility On May 13, 2021, we entered into a 5-year credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on May 13, 2026. The credit agreement is structured as an amendment and restatement of our 364-day credit agreement which would have terminated on May 14, 2021. As of July 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit agreement. Any advances under the 5-year credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (a) with respect to loans in U.S. dollars, (i) LIBOR or (ii) the Base Rate (to be defined as the highest of (x) the Bank of America prime rate, (y) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50% and (z) a daily rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%), (b) with respect to loans in Euros, EURIBOR, (c) with respect to loans in Yen, TIBOR and (d) with respect to loans in Pounds Sterling, SONIA plus a credit spread adjustment, plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., provided that in no event will the interest rate be less than 0.0%. We will pay a quarterly commitment fee during the term of the 5-year credit agreement which may vary depending on our senior debt credit ratings. In addition, the 5-year credit agreement incorporates certain sustainability-linked metrics. Specifically, our applicable interest rate and commitment fee are subject to upward or downward adjustments if we achieve, or fail to achieve, certain specified targets based on two key performance indicator metrics: (i) social impact and (ii) foam reduction. We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and, at our option, extend the maturity of the facility for an additional year up to two times. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement.47Table of ContentsRemaining Performance Obligations The following table presents the breakdown of remaining performance obligations (in millions): July 31, 2021July 25, 2020Increase (Decrease)Product$13,270 $11,261 $2,009 Service17,623 17,093 530 Total$30,893 $28,354 $2,539 Total remaining performance obligations increased 9% in fiscal 2021. Remaining performance obligations for product and service increased 18% and 3%, respectively, compared to fiscal 2020.Deferred Revenue The following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue (in millions): July 31, 2021July 25, 2020Increase (Decrease)Product$9,416 $7,895 $1,521 Service12,748 12,551 197 Total$22,164 $20,446 $1,718 Reported as:Current$12,148 $11,406 $742 Noncurrent10,016 9,040 976 Total$22,164 $20,446 $1,718 Total deferred revenue increased 8% in fiscal 2021. The increase in deferred product revenue of 19% was primarily due to increased deferrals related to our recurring software offerings. The increase in deferred service revenue was driven by the impact of contract renewals, partially offset by amortization of deferred service revenue.Contractual Obligations The impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. In addition, we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at July 31, 2021 (in millions): PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIODJuly 31, 2021TotalLess than 1 Year1 to 3 Years3 to 5 YearsMore than 5 YearsOperating leases$1,245 $355 $474 $197 $219 Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers10,254 6,903 1,806 1,545 — Other purchase obligations1,074 584 336 96 58 Senior notes11,500 2,500 2,250 1,250 5,500 Transition tax payable6,910 727 2,091 4,092 — Other long-term liabilities1,428 — 291 160 977 Total by period$32,411 $11,069 $7,248 $7,340 $6,754 Other long-term liabilities (uncertainty in the timing of future payments)2,490 Total$34,901 Operating Leases For more information on our operating leases, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure long-term pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. A significant portion of our reported estimated purchase 48Table of Contentscommitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in “Inventory Supply Chain.” Other Purchase Obligations Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations. Long-Term Debt The amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Transition Tax Payable Transition tax payable represents future cash tax payments associated with the one-time U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Tax Act”). See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $2.4 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $134 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other CommitmentsIn connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our privately held investments, some of which may be based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion as of July 31, 2021 and July 25, 2020, respectively.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements. In the ordinary course of business, we have privately held investments and provide financing to certain customers. Certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our privately held investments and customer financings, and we have determined that as of July 31, 2021 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities.On an ongoing basis, we reassess our privately held investments and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing Receivables and Guarantees.”Liquidity and Capital Resource RequirementsWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has not materially impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date, it has led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets. The pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, pending acquisitions, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources. 49Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskOur financial position is exposed to a variety of risks, including interest rate risk, equity price risk, and foreign currency exchange risk. We have seen an increase in these risks and related uncertainties with increased volatility in the financial markets in the current environment with the COVID-19 pandemic.Interest Rate RiskAvailable-for-Sale Debt Investments We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our primary objective for holding available-for-sale debt investments is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk. At any time, a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates as has also happened recently, including the impact from lower credit spreads, could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives. We had no outstanding hedging instruments for our available-for-sale debt investments as of July 31, 2021. Our available-for-sale debt investments are held for purposes other than trading. Our available-for-sale debt investments are not leveraged as of July 31, 2021. We monitor our interest rate and credit risks, including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong.The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our available-for-sale debt investments, including the hedging effects when applicable, as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates. The market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), plus 100 BPS, and plus 150 BPS. The hypothetical fair values as of July 31, 2021 and July 25, 2020 are as follows (in millions): VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTSFAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 31, 2021VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS)(100 BPS)(50 BPS)50 BPS100 BPS150 BPSAvailable-for-sale debt investments$15,537$15,427$15,317$15,206$15,096$14,986$14,875 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTSFAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 25, 2020VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS)(100 BPS)(50 BPS)50 BPS100 BPS150 BPSAvailable-for-sale debt investments$17,877$17,788$17,699$17,610$17,522$17,433$17,344Financing Receivables As of July 31, 2021, our financing receivables had a carrying value of $9.3 billion, compared with $10.8 billion as of July 25, 2020. As of July 31, 2021, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.1 billion, respectively. Debt As of July 31, 2021, we had $11.5 billion in principal amount of senior fixed-rate notes outstanding. The carrying amount of the senior notes was $11.5 billion, and the related fair value based on market prices was $13.7 billion. As of July 31, 2021, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed-rate debt, excluding the $2.0 billion of hedged debt, by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.4 billion, respectively. However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed-rate debt that is not hedged.Equity Price RiskMarketable Equity Investments The fair value of our marketable equity investments is subject to market price volatility. We hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio. These equity securities are held for purposes other than trading. As of July 31, 2021, the total fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities was $137 million. We had no outstanding marketable equity securities as of July 25, 2020.Privately Held Investments These investments are recorded in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of July 31, 2021, the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held investments was $1.5 billion, compared with $1.3 billion at July 25, 2020. Some of these companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of privately held investments is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including, among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return. 50Table of ContentsForeign Currency Exchange RiskOur foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at fiscal year-end are summarized in U.S. dollar equivalents as follows (in millions): July 31, 2021July 25, 2020 Notional AmountFair ValueNotional AmountFair ValueForward contracts:Purchased$2,441 $(14)$2,441 $1 Sold$1,698 $12 $1,874 $4 At July 31, 2021 and July 25, 2020, we had no option contracts outstanding. We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations.Approximately 70% of our operating expenses are U.S.-dollar denominated. In fiscal 2021, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, increased our combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $214 million, or 1.2%, as compared with fiscal 2020. To reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by non-U.S.-dollar denominated operating expenses and costs, we may hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts. These hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons. In designing a specific hedging approach, we consider several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of exposures, costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument, and potential effectiveness of the hedge. The gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales.We also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities. The market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances. We do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for speculative purposes.51Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:08:52.531080
858877,CSCO,"CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.",2022,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—Russia and Ukraine War” for a discussion of the impact on Cisco’s business of the on-going Russia and Ukraine war.There can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence of debt. As of the end of fiscal 2022, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of $9.0 billion that mature at specific dates from calendar year 2023 through 2040. We have also established a commercial paper program under which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $10.0 billion, and we had $0.6 billion in commercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of July 30, 2022. There can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources. Further, we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both 25Table of Contentsour debt and equity securities, as well as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program or future debt issuances.Our reputation and/or business could be negatively impacted by ESG matters and/or our reporting of such matters.There is an increasing focus from regulators, certain investors, and other stakeholders concerning environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) matters, both in the United States and internationally. We communicate certain ESG-related initiatives, goals, and/or commitments regarding environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing and social investments, and other matters, in our annual Purpose Report, on our website, in our filings with the SEC, and elsewhere. These initiatives, goals, or commitments could be difficult to achieve and costly to implement. For example, in September 2021, we announced our commitment to achieve net zero across all scopes of greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, the achievement of which relies, in large part, on the accuracy of our estimates and assumptions around the enhanced power efficiency of our products, the adoption of renewable energy at customer sites, and the adoption of certain of our products and services by our customers. We could fail to achieve, or be perceived to fail to achieve, our 2040 net zero commitment or other ESG-related initiatives, goals, or commitments. In addition, we could be criticized for the timing, scope or nature of these initiatives, goals, or commitments, or for any revisions to them. To the extent that our required and voluntary disclosures about ESG matters increase, we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of such disclosures. Our actual or perceived failure to achieve our ESG-related initiatives, goals, or commitments could negatively impact our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.Risks Related to Intellectual PropertyOur proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce.We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. Although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending, there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that our rights will, in fact, provide competitive advantages to us. Furthermore, many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards, which are usable by all market entrants. In addition, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. The outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the United States. Although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete, if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features (including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights) in a market, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time, and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful.We may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others.Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. Because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field, the secrecy of some pending patents, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others. The asserted claims and/or initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, or customers, alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. Where claims are made by customers, resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships. There can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all, or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers. Furthermore, because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. For additional information regarding our indemnification obligations, see Note 14(e) to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report. Our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks. Further, in the 26Table of Contentspast, third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.We rely on the availability of third-party licenses.Many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products. There can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products.Risks Related to Cybersecurity, Privacy, and Regulatory RequirementsCyber attacks, data breaches or malware may disrupt our operations, harm our operating results and financial condition, and damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business; and cyber attacks or data breaches on our customers’ or third-party providers’ networks, or in cloud-based services provided to, by, or enabled by us, could result in claims of liability against us, give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.We experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our products, services, and IT environment on a regular basis, and we anticipate continuing to be subject to such attempts as cyber attacks become increasingly sophisticated and more difficult to predict and protect against. Despite our implementation of security measures, (i) our products and services, and (ii) the servers, data centers, and cloud-based solutions on which our and third-party data is stored or processed (including servers, data centers and cloud-based solutions operated by third parties on which we rely) (collectively, our “IT environment”), are vulnerable to cyber attacks, data breaches, malware, inadvertent error, disruptions from unauthorized access, tampering or other theft or misuse, including by employees, contingent workers, malicious actors, or nation-states or their agents (which cyber attack or related activity may intensify during periods of diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the Russia and Ukraine war). Such events have caused, and in the future could result in, compromise to, or the disruption of access to, the operation of our products, services, and IT environment or those of our customers or third-party providers we rely on, or result in confidential information stored on our systems, our customers’ systems, or other third-party systems being improperly accessed, processed, disclosed not or in the future, or be lost or stolen. For example, in December 2021, multiple vulnerabilities were reported for the widely used Java logging library, Apache Log4j. We reviewed the use of this library within our products and services, its use in our enterprise IT environment, and its use by our third-party providers, and have taken steps to mitigate these vulnerabilities, including by providing security updates for affected products to our customers. We have not to date experienced a material event related to a cybersecurity matter; however, the occurrence of any such event in the future could subject us to liability to our customers, data subjects, suppliers, business partners, employees, and others, give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, could damage our reputation or could otherwise materially harm our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Efforts to limit the ability of malicious actors to disrupt the operations of the Internet or undermine our own security efforts are costly to implement and may not be successful. Breaches of security in our customers’ or third-party providers’ networks, in third-party products we use, or in cloud-based services provided to, by, or enabled by us, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services, or a failure to maintain the digital security infrastructure or security tools that protect the integrity of our products, services, and IT environment, could, in each case, result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.Vulnerabilities and critical security defects, prioritization decisions regarding remedying vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying security updates in a timely manner or deciding not to upgrade products, services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation, or otherwise materially harm our business.The products and services we sell to customers, and our cloud-based solutions, inevitably contain vulnerabilities or security defects which have not been remedied and cannot be disclosed without compromising security. We also make prioritization decisions in determining which vulnerabilities or security defects to fix and the timing of these fixes. Customers may also need to test security updates before they can be deployed which can delay implementation. When customers do not deploy security updates in a timely manner, or decide not to upgrade to the latest versions of our products, services or cloud-based solutions containing the security update, they may be left vulnerable. In addition, we rely on third-party providers of software and cloud-based services on which our and third-party data is stored or processed, and we cannot control the timing at which third-party providers remedy vulnerabilities, which could leave us vulnerable. Vulnerabilities and security defects, prioritization errors in remedying vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects, or 27Table of Contentscustomers not deploying security updates in a timely manner or deciding not to upgrade products, services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.Our actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal data could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm of business.Global privacy and data protection-related laws and regulations are evolving, extensive, and complex. Compliance with these laws and regulations is difficult and costly. In addition, evolving legal requirements restricting or controlling the collection, processing, or cross-border transmission of data, including for regulation of cloud-based services, could materially affect our customers’ ability to use, and our ability to sell, our products and services. The interpretation and application of these laws in some instances is uncertain, and our legal and regulatory obligations are subject to frequent changes. For example, the European Union’s (“EU”) General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) applies to our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services offered in the EU and imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. Additionally, we are subject to California’s Consumer Privacy Act and other laws, regulations and obligations that relate to the handling of personal data. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations relating to personal data, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use, or other processing, could subject us to liability to our customers, data subjects, suppliers, business partners, employees, and others, give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, could damage our reputation or could otherwise materially harm our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.Our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed by evolving regulatory uncertainty or obligations applicable to our products and services.Changes in regulatory requirements applicable to the industries in which we operate, in the United States and in other countries, could materially affect the sales of our products and services. In particular, economic sanctions and changes to export control requirements, have impacted and may continue to impact our ability to sell and support our products and services in certain jurisdictions. In addition, changes in telecommunications regulations could impact our service provider customers’ purchase of our products and services, and they could also impact sales of our own regulated offerings. Additional areas of uncertainty that could impact sales of our products and services include laws and regulations related to encryption technology, environmental sustainability (including climate change), human rights, product certification, and national security controls applicable to our supply chain. For example, new laws and regulations in response to climate change could result in increased energy efficiency requirements for our products and increased compliance and energy costs. Changes in regulatory requirements in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.Risks Related to Ownership of Our StockOur stock price may be volatile.Historically, our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility, particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us. Furthermore, speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations, business, security of our products, or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies, in particular, and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions, or any difficulties associated with such transactions, by us or our current or potential competitors, may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future. Additionally, volatility, lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, virtually all of whom are compensated, in part, based on the performance of our stock price.28Table of ContentsItem 1B.Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 2.PropertiesOur corporate headquarters are located at an owned site in San Jose, California, in the United States of America.

We remain focused on delivering innovation across our technologies to assist our customers in executing on their digital transformations. We continue to be negatively impacted by supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages. While we did see some easing of the supply constraints towards the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect the constraints to continue and the duration is uncertain. We have, and continue to take, multiple steps in order to mitigate the component shortages and deliver products to our customers. We continued to make progress in the transition of our business model delivering increased software and subscriptions. We remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we believe that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities. We continue to operate in a challenging macroeconomic and highly competitive environment. While the overall environment remains uncertain, we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term.Total revenue increased by 3% compared with fiscal 2021. Within total revenue, product revenue increased by 6% and service revenue decreased by 2%. Fiscal 2022 had 52 weeks, compared with 53 weeks in fiscal 2021, thus our results for fiscal 2022 reflect one less week compared with fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2022, total software revenue was flat at $15.1 billion across all product areas and service. Within total software revenue, subscription revenue increased 3%. Total gross margin decreased by 1.5 percentage points. Product gross margin decreased by 2.1 percentage points, largely driven by increased costs related to supply constraints and to a lesser extent, product mix, partially offset by favorable pricing. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, decreased by 1.3 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 1.3 percentage points. Diluted earnings per share increased 13%, driven by an increase of 12% in net income and a decrease in diluted share count of 44 million shares. In terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the Americas increased by $0.7 billion, EMEA revenue increased by $0.8 billion and revenue in our APJC segment increased by $0.3 billion.From a customer market standpoint, we experienced product revenue growth in the commercial, enterprise and service provider markets partially offset by a decline in the public sector market.From a product category perspective, total product revenue increased 6% year over year, driven by growth in revenue in Secure, Agile Networks of 5%; Internet for the Future of 17%; End-to-End Security of 9% and Optimized Application Experiences of 11%; partially offset by a product revenue decline in Collaboration of 5%.Russia and Ukraine WarIn March 2022, in connection with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Cisco announced its intention to stop business operations in Russia and Belarus for the foreseeable future. Those operations in Russia and Belarus included sales, services and related support functions. Further, on June 23, 2022, we announced that we will begin an orderly wind-down and exit of our business in Russia and Belarus.Our business operations in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, collectively, comprised approximately 1% of our total revenue for the year ended July 31, 2021. Russia and Belarus, collectively, represented less than 0.1% of our total assets at the end of fiscal 2022. As a result of the war and the resulting events, we have not recognized revenue in these countries effective March 2022. The negative impact to total revenue was approximately $200 million for fiscal 2022, which includes committed revenue we would have otherwise recognized, charges for uncollectible receivables, and other items. Further, we also assessed the risk to the recoverability of our assets and other potential financial exposures in these countries. We have reserved for the non-recoverability of substantially all of our assets in Russia and Belarus. As a result, we have recognized certain non-recurring charges of $91 million in cost of sales and operating expenses in fiscal 2022 related to non-recoverability of certain assets, special personnel-related charges in order to support impacted employees, and severance and other exit related costs.The ongoing effect of the Russia and Ukraine war are difficult to predict due to the other uncertainties identified in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.33Table of ContentsFourth Quarter SnapshotFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, total revenue, product revenue and service revenue were each flat as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. With regard to our geographic segment performance, on a year-over-year basis, revenue in EMEA increased by 8% offset by declines in Americas and APJC by 3% and 2%, respectively. From a product category perspective, we experienced product revenue growth in Collaboration; End-to-End Security and Optimized Application Experiences; partially offset by declines in Secure, Agile Networks and Internet for the Future. Total gross margin decreased by 2.3 percentage points, driven by higher component and commodity costs, in addition to higher freight and logistics costs related to supply constraints, partially offset by favorable pricing and product mix. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively decreased by 1.2 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 1.0 percentage points. Diluted earnings per share decreased by 4%, driven by a decrease in net income of 6% and a decrease in diluted share count of 101 million shares.

Business.”Other Key Financial MeasuresThe following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021 (in millions): Fiscal 2022Fiscal 2021Cash and cash equivalents and investments$19,267$24,518Cash provided by operating activities$13,226$15,454Remaining performance obligations$31,539$30,893Repurchases of common stock—stock repurchase program$7,734$2,902Dividends paid$6,224$6,163Inventories$2,568$1,55934Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.The inputs into certain of our judgments, assumptions, and estimates considered the economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the associated impact of supply constraints, on our critical and significant accounting estimates. The COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our significant judgments, assumptions and estimates that are reflected in our results for fiscal 2022. These estimates include: goodwill and identified purchased intangible assets and income taxes, among other items. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods.Revenue Recognition We enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We classify our hardware, perpetual software licenses, and SaaS as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment, electronic delivery (or when the software is available for download by the customer), or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes.Revenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices (SSP). SSP is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We assess relevant contractual terms in our customer contracts to determine the transaction price. We apply judgment in identifying contractual terms and determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and various rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, channel partners and customers. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. We also consider the customers’ right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. If actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. 35Table of ContentsInventory Valuation and Liability for Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and SuppliersInventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories, determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of our cost of sales. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory.Our provision for inventory was $102 million, $116 million, and $74 million in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was $227 million, $76 million, and $139 million in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, or if supply constraints were to continue, we could be required to increase our inventory write-downs, and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and accordingly our profitability, could be adversely affected. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs, and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments. We continue to manage through significant supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages caused, in part, by the COVID-19 pandemic. For further discussion around the Supply Constraints Impacts and Risks, see “—Results of Operations—Gross Margin—Supply Constraints Impacts and Risks” and “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Inventory Supply Chain.”Loss ContingenciesWe are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Asset ImpairmentsOur methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020. For the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2022, the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was $64.7 billion for the Americas, $55.2 billion for EMEA, and $21.0 billion for APJC. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. The fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and 36Table of Contentsthen adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. We consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were $15 million for fiscal 2022. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R&D tax credits, foreign-derived intangible income deductions, global intangible low-taxed income, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, and international realignments. Our effective tax rate was 18.4%, 20.1%, and 19.7% in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to foreign-derived intangible income deduction, global intangible low-tax income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The OECD, an international association comprised of 38 countries, including the United States, has made changes and is contemplating additional changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes and any contemplated changes if finalized, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. As a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. 37Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, with the exception of Product Revenue by Category, for which is discussed herein, can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on September 9, 2021.

Our revenue, which includes product and service for each segment, is summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended2022 vs. 2021July 30, 2022July 31, 2021July 25, 2020Variance in DollarsVariance in PercentRevenue: Americas$29,814 $29,161 $29,291 $653 2 %Percentage of revenue57.8 %58.5 %59.4 % EMEA13,715 12,951 12,659 764 6 %Percentage of revenue26.6 %26.0 %25.7 % APJC8,027 7,706 7,352 321 4 %Percentage of revenue15.6 %15.5 %14.9 % Total$51,557 $49,818 $49,301 $1,739 3 %Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. Total revenue in fiscal 2022 increased by 3% compared with fiscal 2021. Product revenue increased by 6% and service revenue decreased by 2%. Our total revenue reflected growth across each of our geographic segments.In addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including the IT spending environment and the level of spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple performance obligations; the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment. 38Table of ContentsProduct Revenue by SegmentThe following table presents the breakdown of product revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended2022 vs. 2021July 30, 2022July 31, 2021July 25, 2020Variance in DollarsVariance in PercentProduct revenue: Americas$21,620 $20,688 $21,006 $932 5 %Percentage of product revenue56.9 %57.5 %58.4 % EMEA10,545 9,805 9,647 740 8 %Percentage of product revenue27.7 %27.2 %26.8 % APJC5,854 5,521 5,326 333 6 %Percentage of product revenue15.4 %15.3 %14.8 % Total$38,018 $36,014 $35,978 $2,004 6 %Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. AmericasProduct revenue in the Americas segment increased by 5%. The product revenue increase was driven by growth in the service provider, commercial and enterprise markets, partially offset by a decline in the public sector market. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 5% in the United States, 5% in Canada and 7% in Mexico, partially offset by a product revenue decrease of 1% in Brazil. EMEAThe increase in product revenue in the EMEA segment of 8% was driven by growth in the commercial, enterprise and service provider markets The public sector market was flat. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 14% in the United Kingdom and 9% in Germany, partially offset by a decline of 3% in France.APJCProduct revenue in the APJC segment increased by 6%, driven by growth in the commercial and enterprise markets, partially offset by declines in the service provider and public sector markets. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 18% in China and 10% in Australia, partially offset by declines of 9% in Japan and 1% in India.39Table of ContentsProduct Revenue by CategoryIn addition to the primary view on a geographic basis, we also prepare financial information related to product categories and customer markets for various purposes. Effective fiscal 2022, we began reporting our product revenue in the following categories: Secure, Agile Networks; Internet for the Future; Collaboration; End-to-End Security; Optimized Application Experiences; and Other Products. This change will better align our product categories with our strategic priorities.The following table presents product revenue by category (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended2022 vs. 20212021 vs. 2020July 30, 2022July 31, 2021July 25, 2020Variance in DollarsVariance in PercentVariance in DollarsVariance in PercentProduct revenue: Secure, Agile Networks$23,829 $22,722 $23,265 $1,107 5 %$(543)(2)%Internet for the Future5,278 4,514 4,180 764 17 %334 8 %Collaboration4,472 4,727 4,823 (255)(5)%(96)(2)%End-to-End Security3,699 3,382 3,158 317 9 %224 7 %Optimized Application Experiences729 654 524 75 11 %130 25 %Other Products11 15 28 (4)(29)%(13)(47)%Total$38,018 $36,014 $35,978 $2,004 6 %$36 — %Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. Secure, Agile NetworksFiscal 2022 Compared with Fiscal 2021The Secure, Agile Networks product category represents our core networking offerings related to switching, enterprise routing, wireless, and compute. Secure, Agile Networks revenue increased by 5%, or $1.1 billion, with growth across the portfolio except enterprise routing. Revenue grew in both campus switching and data center switching, primarily driven by growth in our Catalyst 9000 series, Nexus 9000 series and Meraki switching offerings. The decrease in enterprise routing was primarily driven by declines in our Access and Edge offerings. Wireless had double-digit growth driven by our WiFi-6 products and Meraki offerings. Revenue from compute grew primarily driven by our servers.Fiscal 2021 Compared with Fiscal 2020Revenue from the Secure, Agile Networks product category decreased by 2%, or $543 million, driven by declines across the portfolio with the exception of Wireless. Switching revenue declined in both campus switching and data center switching, although we had double-digit growth in our Catalyst 9000 series and Meraki switching offerings and growth in our Nexus 9000 series. The decrease in enterprise routing was primarily driven by declines in our Access offerings, partially offset by growth in our SD-WAN and Edge offerings. Wireless had solid growth driven by our Meraki offerings and the ramp of our WiFi-6 products. Revenue from compute declined primarily driven by our servers.Internet for the FutureFiscal 2022 Compared with Fiscal 2021The Internet for the Future product category includes our routed optical networking, 5G, silicon and optics solutions. Revenue in our Internet for the Future product category increased by 17%, or $764 million, driven by growth in the webscale provider market. We saw growth in our Cisco 8000, NCS 5500 and ASR 9000 series offerings, and also saw a benefit from our acquisition of Acacia in the third quarter of fiscal 2021.Fiscal 2021 Compared with Fiscal 2020Revenue in our Internet for the Future product category increased 8%, or $334 million, driven by growth in our NCS 5500 series offerings and the ramp of our Cisco 8000 series offerings.40Table of ContentsCollaborationFiscal 2022 Compared with Fiscal 2021The Collaboration product category consists of our Meetings, Collaboration Devices, Calling, Contact Center and CPaaS offerings. Revenue in our Collaboration product category decreased 5%, or $255 million, with declines in our Meetings, Calling and Contact Center offerings, partially offset by the ramp in our CPaaS offerings.Fiscal 2021 Compared with Fiscal 2020Revenue in our Collaboration product category decreased by 2%, or $96 million, with declines in our Collaboration Devices, partially offset by growth in our Meetings, Calling and Contact Center offerings.End-to-End SecurityFiscal 2022 Compared with Fiscal 2021The End-to-End Security product category consists of our Network Security, Cloud Security, Security Endpoints, Unified Threat Management and Zero Trust offerings. Revenue in our End-to-End Security product category increased by 9%, or $317 million, primarily driven by growth in our Zero Trust portfolio, Network Security, Unified Threat Management and Security Endpoint offerings. Our Zero Trust portfolio reflected double-digit growth driven by continued momentum with our Duo offerings.Fiscal 2021 Compared with Fiscal 2020Revenue in our End-to-End Security product category increased by 7%, or $224 million, primarily driven by growth in our cloud-based solutions and Unified Threat Management offerings, partially offset by declines in our Network Security offerings. Our Zero Trust portfolio reflected growth driven by our Duo offerings.Optimized Application ExperiencesFiscal 2022 Compared with Fiscal 2021The Optimized Application Experiences product category includes our full stack observability and cloud-native platforms offerings. Revenue in our Optimized Application Experiences product category increased 11%, or $75 million, driven by growth in our ThousandEyes and Intersight offerings, partially offset by a decline in our AppDynamics offerings.Fiscal 2021 Compared with Fiscal 2020Revenue in our Optimized Application Experiences product category increased by 25%, or $130 million, driven by growth in our Intersight offerings. We also had a benefit from our acquisition of ThousandEyes.Service Revenue by SegmentThe following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended2022 vs. 2021July 30, 2022July 31, 2021July 25, 2020Variance in DollarsVariance in PercentService revenue: Americas$8,194 $8,472 $8,285 $(278)(3)%Percentage of service revenue60.5 %61.4 %62.2 %EMEA3,171 3,146 3,012 25 1 %Percentage of service revenue23.4 %22.8 %22.6 %APJC2,173 2,186 2,026 (13)(1)%Percentage of service revenue16.0 %15.8 %15.2 %Total$13,539 $13,804 $13,323 $(265)(2)%Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. Service revenue decreased 2%, driven by declines in our maintenance business, advisory services and software support offerings, partially offset by growth in our solution support and network support offerings. The extra week in fiscal 2021 also contributed to the decrease in service revenue in fiscal 2022. Service revenue decreased in the Americas and APJC segments, partially offset by growth in the EMEA segment.41Table of ContentsGross MarginThe following table presents the gross margin for products and services (in millions, except percentages):AMOUNTPERCENTAGEYears EndedJuly 30, 2022July 31, 2021July 25, 2020July 30, 2022July 31, 2021July 25, 2020Gross margin:Product$23,204 $22,714 $22,779 61.0 %63.1 %63.3 %Service9,044 9,180 8,904 66.8 %66.5 %66.8 %Total$32,248 $31,894 $31,683 62.5 %64.0 %64.3 %Product Gross MarginThe following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2022:Product Gross Margin PercentageFiscal 202163.1 %Productivity (1)(2.8)%Product pricing1.0 %Mix of products sold(0.3)%Others— %Fiscal 202261.0 % (1) Productivity includes overall manufacturing-related costs, such as component costs, warranty expense, provision for inventory, freight, logistics, shipment volume, and other items not categorized elsewhere.Product gross margin decreased by 2.1 percentage points primarily driven by negative impacts from productivity, largely driven by increased costs related to supply constraints from freight, expedites, and higher component and commodity costs. These impacts were partially offset by favorable pricing. The benefit we saw from favorable pricing was primarily driven by price increases implemented during fiscal 2022, to partially offset increases in components and commodity costs, freight and logistics costs, driven by supply constraints.Supply Constraints Impacts and RisksWe continue to manage through significant supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages caused, in part, by the COVID-19 pandemic, and for which the duration of such constraints is uncertain. These shortages have resulted in increased costs (i.e., component and other commodity costs, freight, expedite fees, etc.) which have had a negative impact on our product gross margin and have resulted in extended lead times for us and our customers. We have taken a number of steps in order to mitigate the supply constraint related impacts including: partnering with several of our key suppliers utilizing our volume purchasing ability and extending supply coverage, including, in certain cases, revising supplier arrangements; paying significantly higher component and logistics costs to secure supply; modifying our product designs in order to leverage alternate suppliers, where possible; and continually optimizing our inventory build and customer delivery plans, among others. We believe these actions are helping us to optimize our access to critical components and meet customer demand for our products. We continue to see solid demand across the majority of our portfolio. As a result, in order to secure supply to meet customer demand, we have increased our inventory balances, inventory purchase commitments, and inventory deposits and prepayments (see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Inventory Supply Chain”), which, in turn, has increased our supply chain exposure. Additionally, in certain situations, we have prepaid or made deposits with suppliers to secure future supply. These actions significantly increase the risk of future material excess and obsolete inventory and related losses if customer demand were to suddenly and significantly decrease in future periods. While we believe we are taking the right strategic and operational actions to address the supply situation, we recognize the increased risks.Service Gross MarginOur service gross margin percentage increased by 0.3 percentage points primarily due to lower headcount-related and delivery costs and favorable mix of service offerings, partially offset by lower sales volume.Our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service 42Table of Contentsbusiness. Other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services.Gross Margin by SegmentThe following table presents the total gross margin for each segment (in millions, except percentages):AMOUNTPERCENTAGEYears EndedJuly 30, 2022July 31, 2021July 25, 2020July 30, 2022July 31, 2021July 25, 2020Gross margin:Americas$19,117 $19,499 $19,547 64.1 %66.9 %66.7 %EMEA8,969 8,466 8,304 65.4 %65.4 %65.6 %APJC5,241 4,949 4,688 65.3 %64.2 %63.8 %Segment total33,326 32,914 32,538 64.6 %66.1 %66.0 %Unallocated corporate items (1)(1,078)(1,020)(855)Total$32,248 $31,894 $31,683 62.5 %64.0 %64.3 % (1) The unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges. We do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments. Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. We experienced a gross margin percentage decrease in our Americas segment due to negative impacts from productivity and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by favorable pricing. Gross margin in our EMEA segment was flat due to higher service gross margin, favorable product mix and favorable pricing offset by negative impacts from productivity.The APJC segment gross margin percentage increase was due to favorable product mix and favorable pricing, partially offset by negative impacts from productivity.The gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment.Research and Development (“R&D”), Sales and Marketing, and General and Administrative (“G&A”) ExpensesR&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses are summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended2022 vs. 2021July 30, 2022July 31, 2021July 25, 2020Variance in DollarsVariance in PercentResearch and development$6,774 $6,549 $6,347 $225 3 %Percentage of revenue13.1 %13.1 %12.9 %Sales and marketing9,085 9,259 9,169 (174)(2)%Percentage of revenue17.6 %18.6 %18.6 %General and administrative2,101 2,152 1,925 (51)(2)%Percentage of revenue4.1 %4.3 %3.9 %Total$17,960 $17,960 $17,441 $— — %Percentage of revenue34.8 %36.1 %35.4 %Our fiscal 2022 had one less week compared with fiscal 2021, which had an extra week.R&D ExpensesR&D expenses increased due to higher headcount-related expenses, higher share-based compensation expense, higher acquisition-related costs and higher contracted services spending, partially offset by lower discretionary spending.43Table of ContentsWe continue to invest in R&D in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. If we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal R&D. Sales and Marketing ExpensesSales and marketing expenses decreased primarily due to lower headcount-related expenses and lower contracted services spending, partially offset by higher discretionary spending, certain non-recurring charges recognized due to the Russia and Ukraine war and higher share-based compensation expense. The extra week in fiscal 2021 contributed to the decrease in headcount-related expenses.G&A ExpensesG&A expenses decreased due to lower contracted services spending, partially offset by certain non-recurring charges recognized due to the Russia and Ukraine war.Effect of Foreign CurrencyIn fiscal 2022, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $154 million, or 0.9%, compared with fiscal 2021. Amortization of Purchased Intangible AssetsThe following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets including impairment charges (in millions):Years EndedJuly 30, 2022July 31, 2021July 25, 2020Amortization of purchased intangible assets:Cost of sales$749 $716 $659 Operating expenses328 215 141 Total$1,077 $931 $800 The increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets was due largely to the amortization of purchased intangibles from our recent acquisitions and impairment charges of $15 million. The impairment charges were primarily due to declines in estimated fair value resulting from reductions in or the elimination of expected future cash flows associated with certain of our technology and in-process research and development (IPR&D) intangible assets.Restructuring and Other ChargesThe following table presents restructuring and other charges (in millions):Years EndedJuly 30, 2022July 31, 2021July 25, 2020Restructuring and other charges included in operating expenses$6 $886 $481 We initiated a restructuring plan in fiscal 2021, which included a voluntary early retirement program, in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas. The total pretax charges were estimated to be approximately $900 million. We incurred cumulative charges of $892 million and completed this plan in fiscal 2022.Operating IncomeThe following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue (in millions, except percentages):Years EndedJuly 30, 2022July 31, 2021July 25, 2020Operating income$13,969 $12,833 $13,620 Operating income as a percentage of revenue27.1 %25.8 %27.6 %Operating income increased by 9%, and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 1.3 percentage points. These changes resulted primarily from a revenue increase and lower restructuring and other charges partially offset by a gross margin percentage decrease (driven by negative impacts from productivity partially offset by favorable pricing).44Table of ContentsInterest and Other Income (Loss), NetInterest Income (Expense), Net The following table summarizes interest income and interest expense (in millions):Years Ended2022 vs. 2021July 30, 2022July 31, 2021July 25, 2020Variance in DollarsInterest income$476 $618 $920 $(142)Interest expense(360)(434)(585)74 Interest income (expense), net$116 $184 $335 $(68)Interest income decreased driven by lower average book yields and lower average balances of cash and available-for-sale debt investments. The decrease in interest expense was driven by a lower average debt balance. Other Income (Loss), Net The components of other income (loss), net, are summarized as follows (in millions):Years Ended2022 vs. 2021July 30, 2022July 31, 2021July 25, 2020Variance in DollarsGains (losses) on investments, net:Available-for-sale debt investments$9 $53 $42 $(44)Marketable equity investments(38)6 (5)(44)Privately held investments486 266 95 220 Net gains (losses) on investments457 325 132 132 Other gains (losses), net(65)(80)(117)15 Other income (loss), net$392 $245 $15 $147 The increase in our other income (loss), net was primarily driven by higher realized and unrealized gains on our privately held investments, and to a lesser extent, favorable impacts from foreign exchange. The increase was partially offset by changes in net gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt investments and marketable equity investments.Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 18.4% for fiscal 2022, compared with 20.1% for fiscal 2021. The net 1.7 percentage points decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in prior year discrete tax expenses and state taxes.For a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.45Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowsCash and Cash Equivalents and Investments The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments (in millions): July 30, 2022July 31, 2021Increase (Decrease)Cash and cash equivalents$7,079 $9,175 $(2,096)Available-for-sale debt investments11,947 15,206 (3,259)Marketable equity securities241 137 104 Total$19,267 $24,518 $(5,251)The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by cash returned to stockholders in the form of repurchases of common stock of $7.7 billion under the stock repurchase program and cash dividends of $6.2 billion, net decrease in debt of $2.5 billion, changes in unrealized losses of our investments and other of $0.9 billion, net increase in restricted cash equivalents of $0.8 billion, capital expenditures of $0.5 billion and net cash paid for acquisitions and divestitures of $0.4 billion. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $13.2 billion and issuance of commercial paper of $0.6 billion.We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below.Securities Lending We periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale debt investments. These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. We did not experience any losses in connection with the secured lending of securities during the periods presented. As of July 30, 2022 and July 31, 2021, we had no outstanding securities lending transactions.Free Cash Flow and Capital Allocation As part of our capital allocation strategy, we target to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our stockholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment. The following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions):Years EndedJuly 30, 2022July 31, 2021July 25, 2020Net cash provided by operating activities$13,226 $15,454 $15,426 Acquisition of property and equipment(477)(692)(770)Free cash flow$12,749 $14,762 $14,656 We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. For additional discussion, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report.We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We 46Table of Contentsfurther regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do.

Any future dividends are subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. The remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program is approximately $15.2 billion, with no termination date.

Inventory Supply Chain The following table summarizes our inventories and inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in millions): July 30, 2022July 31, 2021July 25, 2020Variance vs. July 31, 2021Variance vs. July 25, 2020Inventories$2,568 $1,559 $1,282 $1,009 $1,286 Inventory purchase commitments$12,964 $10,254 $4,406 $2,710 $8,558 Inventory deposits and prepayments$1,484 $162 $117 $1,322 $1,367 The following table summarizes our inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers by period (in millions): July 30, 2022July 31, 2021July 25, 2020Variance vs. July 31, 2021Variance vs. July 25, 2020Less than 1 year$9,954 $6,903 $3,994 $3,051 $5,960 1 to 3 years2,240 1,806 412 434 1,828 3 to 5 years770 1,545 — (775)770 Total$12,964 $10,254 $4,406 $2,710 $8,558 Inventory as of July 30, 2022 increased by 65% and 100% from our inventory balances at the end of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. Inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by 26% and 194% from our balances at the end of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. We increased our balances in inventories, inventory purchase commitments, and inventory deposits and prepayments as compared to prior fiscal years in order to address significant supply constraints seen industry-wide. The increases were primarily due to arrangements to secure supply and pricing for certain product components and commitments with contract manufacturers to meet customer demand and to address extended 47Table of Contentslead times, as well as advance payments with suppliers to secure future supply, as a result of the supply constraints. We have partnered with several of our key suppliers utilizing our volume purchasing and extending supply coverage, including revising supplier arrangements. As discussed, our risks of future material excess and obsolete inventory and related losses are further outlined in the Result of Operations—Product Gross Margin section.We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. Our inventory purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of our inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure supply and pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed.Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of supply constraints, rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and inventory purchase commitments is appropriate for our current and expected customer demand and revenue levels.Financing Receivables and Guarantees The following table summarizes our financing receivables (in millions): July 30, 2022July 31, 2021Increase (Decrease)Lease receivables, net$1,175 $1,697 $(522)Loan receivables, net4,556 5,117 (561)Financed service contracts, net2,183 2,450 (267)Total, net$7,914 $9,264 $(1,350)Financing Receivables Our financing arrangements include leases, loans, and financed service contracts. Lease receivables include sales-type leases. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware, software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We also provide financing to certain qualified customers for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services. The majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed. Financing receivables decreased by 15%.Financing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, with payment terms generally ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. The volume of channel partner financing was $27.9 billion, $26.7 billion, and $26.9 billion in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion as of July 30, 2022 and July 31, 2021, respectively. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. As of July 30, 2022, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $179 million, of which approximately $9 million was recorded as deferred revenue.48Table of ContentsBorrowingsSenior Notes The following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes (in millions): Maturity DateJuly 30, 2022July 31, 2021Senior notes:Fixed-rate notes:1.85%September 20, 2021$— $2,000 3.00%June 15, 2022— 500 2.60%February 28, 2023500 500 2.20%September 20, 2023750 750 3.625%March 4, 20241,000 1,000 3.50%June 15, 2025500 500 2.95%February 28, 2026750 750 2.50%September 20, 20261,500 1,500 5.90%February 15, 20392,000 2,000 5.50%January 15, 20402,000 2,000 Total$9,000 $11,500 Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of July 30, 2022.Commercial Paper We have a short-term debt financing program in which up to $10.0 billion is available through the issuance of commercial paper notes. We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. We had $0.6 billion in commercial paper notes outstanding as of July 30, 2022, and no commercial paper outstanding as of July 31, 2021.Credit Facility On May 13, 2021, we entered into a 5-year credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on May 13, 2026. As of July 30, 2022, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit agreement. Any advances under the 5-year credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (a) with respect to loans in U.S. dollars, (i) LIBOR or (ii) the Base Rate (to be defined as the highest of (x) the Bank of America prime rate, (y) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50% and (z) a daily rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%), (b) with respect to loans in Euros, EURIBOR, (c) with respect to loans in Yen, TIBOR and (d) with respect to loans in Pounds Sterling, SONIA plus a credit spread adjustment, plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., provided that in no event will the interest rate be less than 0.0%. We will pay a quarterly commitment fee during the term of the 5-year credit agreement which may vary depending on our senior debt credit ratings. In addition, the 5-year credit agreement incorporates certain sustainability-linked metrics. Specifically, our applicable interest rate and commitment fee are subject to upward or downward adjustments if we achieve, or fail to achieve, certain specified targets based on two key performance indicator metrics: (i) social impact and (ii) foam reduction. We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and, at our option, extend the maturity of the facility for an additional year up to two times. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement.49Table of ContentsRemaining Performance Obligations The following table presents the breakdown of remaining performance obligations (in millions): July 30, 2022July 31, 2021Increase (Decrease)Product$14,090 $13,270 $820 Service17,449 17,623 (174) Total$31,539 $30,893 $646 Short-term RPO$16,936 $16,289 $647 Long-term RPO14,603 14,604 (1)Total$31,539 $30,893 $646 Total remaining performance obligations increased 2% in fiscal 2022.

We expect approximately 54% of total remaining performance obligations to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months.Deferred Revenue The following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue (in millions): July 30, 2022July 31, 2021Increase (Decrease)Product$10,427 $9,416 $1,011 Service12,837 12,748 89 Total$23,264 $22,164 $1,100 Reported as:Current$12,784 $12,148 $636 Noncurrent10,480 10,016 464 Total$23,264 $22,164 $1,100 Total deferred revenue increased 5% in fiscal 2022. The increase in deferred product revenue of 11% was primarily due to increased deferrals related to our recurring software offerings. The slight increase in deferred service revenue was driven by the impact of contract renewals, partially offset by amortization of deferred service revenue.Contractual ObligationsThe impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. In addition, we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process.

Our inventory purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of our inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure supply and pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in “Inventory Supply Chain.” Other Purchase Obligations Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations.Long-Term Debt The amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Transition Tax Payable Transition tax payable represents future cash tax payments associated with the one-time U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Tax Act”).Other Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $2.3 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $55 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other CommitmentsIn connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our privately held investments, some of which may be based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones or are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $0.4 billion and $0.2 billion as of July 30, 2022 and July 31, 2021, respectively.In the ordinary course of business, we have privately held investments and provide financing to certain customers. Certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our privately held investments and customer financings, and we have determined that as of July 30, 2022 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities.On an ongoing basis, we reassess our privately held investments and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing Receivables and Guarantees.”Liquidity and Capital Resource RequirementsWhile the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia and Ukraine war have not materially impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date, it has led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets. These events and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs (including inventory and other supply related payments), capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, pending acquisitions, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. We expect increased payments related to inventory and other supply related payments through at least the next 12 months. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with 51Table of Contentsunconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources. 52Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskOur financial position is exposed to a variety of risks, including interest rate risk, equity price risk, and foreign currency exchange risk.Interest Rate RiskAvailable-for-Sale Debt Investments We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our primary objective for holding available-for-sale debt investments is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk. At any time, a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates, including the impact from lower credit spreads, could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives. We had no outstanding hedging instruments for our available-for-sale debt investments as of July 30, 2022. Our available-for-sale debt investments are held for purposes other than trading. Our available-for-sale debt investments are not leveraged as of July 30, 2022. We monitor our interest rate and credit risks, including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong.The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our available-for-sale debt investments, including the hedging effects when applicable, as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates. The market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), plus 100 BPS, and plus 150 BPS. The hypothetical fair values as of July 30, 2022 and July 31, 2021 are as follows (in millions): VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTSFAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 30, 2022VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS)(100 BPS)(50 BPS)50 BPS100 BPS150 BPSAvailable-for-sale debt investments$12,263$12,158$12,052$11,947$11,841$11,735$11,630 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTSFAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 31, 2021VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS)(100 BPS)(50 BPS)50 BPS100 BPS150 BPSAvailable-for-sale debt investments$15,537$15,427$15,317$15,206$15,096$14,986$14,875Financing Receivables As of July 30, 2022, our financing receivables had a carrying value of $7.9 billion, compared with $9.3 billion as of July 31, 2021. As of July 30, 2022, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.1 billion, respectively. Debt As of July 30, 2022, we had $9.0 billion in principal amount of senior fixed-rate notes outstanding. The carrying amount of the senior notes was $8.9 billion, and the related fair value based on market prices was $9.7 billion. As of July 30, 2022, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed-rate debt, excluding the $1.5 billion of hedged debt, by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.3 billion, respectively. However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed-rate debt that is not hedged.Equity Price RiskMarketable Equity Investments The fair value of our marketable equity investments is subject to market price volatility. We hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio. These equity securities are held for purposes other than trading. The total fair value of our marketable equity securities was $241 million and $137 million as of July 30, 2022 and July 31, 2021, respectively.Privately Held Investments These investments are recorded in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of July 30, 2022, the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held investments was $1.9 billion, compared with $1.5 billion at July 31, 2021. Some of these companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of privately held investments is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including, among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return. 53Table of ContentsForeign Currency Exchange RiskOur foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at fiscal year-end are summarized in U.S. dollar equivalents as follows (in millions): July 30, 2022July 31, 2021 Notional AmountFair ValueNotional AmountFair ValueForward contracts:Purchased$2,578 $(50)$2,441 $(14)Sold$1,943 $50 $1,698 $12 We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations.Approximately 70% of our operating expenses are U.S.-dollar denominated. In fiscal 2022, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased our combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $154 million, or 0.9%, as compared with fiscal 2021. To reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by non-U.S.-dollar denominated operating expenses and costs, we may hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts. These hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons. In designing a specific hedging approach, we consider several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of exposures, costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument, and potential effectiveness of the hedge. The gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales.We also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities. The market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances. We do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for speculative purposes.54Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:08:51.557267

We remain focused on delivering innovation across our technologies to assist our customers in executing on their digital transformations. In past periods, we took multiple actions in order to mitigate component shortages and address supply constraints seen industry-wide. During fiscal 2023, we saw an overall improvement of supply constraints and, as a result, we were able to increase the delivery of products to our customers, which positively impacted product revenue. Further, we continued to make progress in the transition of our business model delivering increased software and subscriptions. We remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we believe that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities. We continue to operate in a challenging macroeconomic and highly competitive environment. While the overall environment remains uncertain, we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term.Total revenue increased by 11% compared with fiscal 2022. Within total revenue, product revenue increased by 13% and service revenue increased by 2%. In fiscal 2023, total software revenue was $17.0 billion across all product areas and service, an increase of 12%. Within total software revenue, subscription revenue increased 16%. Although product revenue increased, we saw a decline in product demand in fiscal 2023. We believe this was due to customers absorbing recently shipped products, adjusting to significant reductions in product lead times, and macroeconomic conditions.Total gross margin increased by 0.2 percentage points. Product gross margin increased by 0.5 percentage points, largely driven by favorable pricing and favorable product mix partially offset by negative impacts from productivity. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, increased by 0.1 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 0.7 percentage points driven primarily by restructuring and other charges of $531 million in fiscal 2023. Diluted earnings per share increased by 9%, driven by an increase of 7% in net income and a decrease in diluted share count of 87 million shares. In terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the Americas increased by $3.6 billion, EMEA revenue increased by $1.4 billion and revenue in our APJC segment increased by $0.4 billion. We experienced product revenue growth across each of our customer markets. From a product category perspective, total product revenue increased 13% year over year, driven by growth in revenue in Secure, Agile Networks of 22%; Internet for the Future of 1%; End-to-End Security of 4% and Optimized Application Experiences of 11%; partially offset by a product revenue decline in Collaboration of 9%.33Table of ContentsFourth Quarter SnapshotFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, total revenue increased by 16%. Within total revenue, product revenue increased by 20% and service revenue increased by 4%. With regard to our geographic segment performance, on a year-over-year basis, revenue in Americas increased by 21%, EMEA increased by 10% and APJC by 7%. From a product category perspective, we experienced product revenue growth in Secure, Agile Networks; Internet for the Future and Optimized Application Experiences; partially offset by a decline in Collaboration. Product revenue in End-to-End Security was flat. Total gross margin increased by 2.8 percentage points, driven by favorable pricing, favorable product mix and productivity benefits driven by lower freight and logistics costs, component and other costs. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, decreased by 0.2 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 1.8 percentage points. Diluted earnings per share increased by 43%, driven by an increase in net income of 41% and a decrease in diluted share count of 44 million shares.Strategy and PrioritiesAs our customers add billions of new connections to their enterprises, and as more applications move to a multicloud environment, the network becomes even more critical. Our customers are navigating change at an unprecedented pace. In this dynamic environment, we believe their priorities are to transform infrastructure, secure the enterprise, power hybrid work, reimagine applications, and drive toward sustainability.Our strategy is to securely connect everything. We are committed to driving a trusted customer experience, through our innovation, solutions, choice, and people. For a full discussion of our strategy and priorities, see “Item 1. Business.”Other Key Financial MeasuresThe following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022 (in millions): Fiscal 2023Fiscal 2022Cash and cash equivalents and investments$26,146$19,267Cash provided by operating activities$19,886$13,226Remaining performance obligations$34,868$31,539Repurchases of common stock—stock repurchase program$4,271$7,734Dividends paid$6,302$6,224Inventories$3,644$2,56834Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.Revenue Recognition We enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We classify our hardware, perpetual software licenses, and SaaS as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment, electronic delivery (or when the software is available for download by the customer), or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes.Revenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices (SSP). SSP is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We assess relevant contractual terms in our customer contracts to determine the transaction price. We apply judgment in identifying contractual terms and determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and various rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, channel partners and customers. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. We also consider the customers’ right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. If actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. Inventory Valuation and Liability for Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and SuppliersInventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories, determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of our cost of sales. At 35Table of Contentsthe point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory.Our provision for inventory was $307 million, $102 million, and $116 million in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was $423 million, $227 million, and $76 million in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, or if supply constraints were to continue, we could be required to increase our inventory write-downs, and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and accordingly our profitability, could be adversely affected. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs, and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments. For further discussion around the Supply Constraints Impacts and Risks, see “—Results of Operations—Gross Margin—Supply Constraints Impacts and Risks” and “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Inventory Supply Chain.”Loss ContingenciesWe are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Asset ImpairmentsOur methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021. For the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2023, the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was $61.3 billion for the Americas, $73.8 billion for EMEA, and $34.3 billion for APJC. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. The fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. We consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured 36Table of Contentsby comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R&D tax credits, foreign-derived intangible income deductions, global intangible low-taxed income, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, and international realignments. Our effective tax rate was 17.7%, 18.4%, and 20.1% in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to foreign-derived intangible income deduction, global intangible low-tax income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The OECD, an international association comprised of 38 countries, including the United States, has made changes and is contemplating additional changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes and any contemplated changes if finalized, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. As a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. 37Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 is presented below.

Our revenue, which includes product and service for each segment, is summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended2023 vs. 2022July 29, 2023July 30, 2022July 31, 2021Variance in DollarsVariance in PercentRevenue: Americas$33,447 $29,814 $29,161 $3,633 12 %Percentage of revenue58.7 %57.8 %58.5 % EMEA15,135 13,715 12,951 1,420 10 %Percentage of revenue26.6 %26.6 %26.0 % APJC8,417 8,027 7,706 390 5 %Percentage of revenue14.8 %15.6 %15.5 % Total$56,998 $51,557 $49,818 $5,441 11 %Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. Total revenue in fiscal 2023 increased by 11% compared with fiscal 2022. Product revenue increased by 13% and service revenue increased by 2%. Our total revenue reflected growth across each of our geographic segments.In addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including the IT spending environment and the level of spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by the timing of revenue recognition for complex transactions with multiple performance obligations. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment.38Table of ContentsProduct Revenue by SegmentThe following table presents the breakdown of product revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended2023 vs. 2022July 29, 2023July 30, 2022July 31, 2021Variance in DollarsVariance in PercentProduct revenue: Americas$25,019 $21,620 $20,688 $3,399 16 %Percentage of product revenue58.0 %56.9 %57.5 % EMEA11,866 10,545 9,805 1,321 13 %Percentage of product revenue27.5 %27.7 %27.2 % APJC6,257 5,854 5,521 403 7 %Percentage of product revenue14.5 %15.4 %15.3 % Total$43,142 $38,018 $36,014 $5,124 13 %Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. AmericasProduct revenue in the Americas segment increased by 16%. The product revenue increase was driven by growth across all customer markets. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 15% in the United States, 10% in Canada, 31% in Mexico and 25% in Brazil. EMEAThe increase in product revenue in the EMEA segment of 13% was driven by growth in the public sector, enterprise and commercial markets, partially offset by a decline in the service provider market. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 16% in Germany, 4% in the United Kingdom and 19% in France.APJCProduct revenue in the APJC segment increased by 7%, driven by growth in the commercial and public sector markets, partially offset by a decline in the service provider market. Product revenue in the enterprise market was flat. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 62% in India, 13% in Australia and 8% in China, partially offset by a decline of 6% in Japan.39Table of ContentsProduct Revenue by CategoryIn addition to the primary view on a geographic basis, we also prepare financial information related to product categories and customer markets for various purposes.The following table presents product revenue by category (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended2023 vs. 2022July 29, 2023July 30, 2022July 31, 2021Variance in DollarsVariance in PercentProduct revenue: Secure, Agile Networks$29,105 $23,831 $22,725 $5,274 22 %Internet for the Future5,306 5,276 4,511 30 1 %Collaboration4,052 4,472 4,727 (420)(9)%End-to-End Security3,859 3,699 3,382 160 4 %Optimized Application Experiences811 729 654 82 11 %Other Products9 11 15 (2)(15)%Total$43,142 $38,018 $36,014 $5,124 13 %Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. Amounts for prior fiscal years have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year’s presentation.Secure, Agile NetworksThe Secure, Agile Networks product category represents our core networking offerings related to switching, enterprise routing, wireless, and compute. Secure, Agile Networks revenue increased by 22%, or $5.3 billion, with growth across the portfolio except servers. Revenue grew in both campus switching and data center switching. This was primarily driven by strong growth in our Catalyst 9000 series, Nexus 9000 series and Meraki switching offerings. The increase in enterprise routing was primarily driven by growth in our Catalyst 8000 routers, SD-WAN and IoT routing offerings. Wireless had strong double-digit growth driven by our WiFi-6 products and Meraki offerings.Internet for the FutureThe Internet for the Future product category includes our routed optical networking, 5G, silicon and optics solutions. Revenue in our Internet for the Future product category increased by 1%, or $30 million, primarily driven by growth in our Core routing portfolio, including our Cisco 8000 series offerings. We also saw double-digit growth in the webscale provider market.CollaborationThe Collaboration product category consists of our Meetings, Collaboration Devices, Calling, Contact Center and CPaaS offerings. Revenue in our Collaboration product category decreased 9%, or $420 million, primarily driven by declines in Collaboration Devices and Meetings, partially offset by growth in our Calling and Contact Center offerings.End-to-End SecurityRevenue in our End-to-End Security product category increased by 4%, or $160 million, primarily driven by growth in our Unified Threat Management offerings and Zero Trust portfolio.Optimized Application ExperiencesThe Optimized Application Experiences product category consists of our full stack observability and network assurance offerings. Revenue in our Optimized Application Experiences product category increased 11%, or $82 million, driven by growth across the portfolio, including double-digit growth in our ThousandEyes offerings.40Table of ContentsService Revenue by SegmentThe following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended2023 vs. 2022July 29, 2023July 30, 2022July 31, 2021Variance in DollarsVariance in PercentService revenue: Americas$8,427 $8,194 $8,472 $233 3 %Percentage of service revenue60.8 %60.5 %61.4 %EMEA3,269 3,171 3,146 98 3 %Percentage of service revenue23.6 %23.4 %22.8 %APJC2,160 2,173 2,186 (13)(1)%Percentage of service revenue15.6 %16.0 %15.8 %Total$13,856 $13,539 $13,804 $317 2 %Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding.

The favorable pricing was primarily driven by price increases implemented during fiscal 2022 and were recognized as we ship our products. This was partially offset by negative impacts from productivity, largely driven by increased costs from component and other costs, partially offset by lower freight and logistics costs. We implemented the price increases to partially offset increases in commodity and other costs.41Table of ContentsSupply Constraints Impacts and RisksDuring fiscal 2023, we saw an overall improvement of supply constraints which have persisted industry-wide for multiple periods. In past periods, we took multiple actions in order to mitigate component shortages and address significant supply constraints. These supply constraints resulted in significant increased costs (i.e., component and other commodity costs, expedite fees, etc.) which had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our product gross margin and resulted in extended lead times for us and our customers. The mitigating actions we took included: partnering with several of our key suppliers utilizing our volume purchasing ability and extending supply coverage, including, in certain cases, revising supplier arrangements; paying and committing to pay in the future significantly higher costs for certain components; modifying our product designs in order to leverage alternate suppliers, where possible; and continually optimizing our inventory build and customer delivery plans, among others. These mitigating actions have resulted in increased inventory balances, inventory purchase commitments, and inventory deposits and prepayments compared to prior fiscal years, which, in turn, has increased our supply chain exposure, which could result in negative impacts to our product gross margin in future periods, including material excess and obsolete charges, if product demand significantly decreases for a sustained duration or we are unable to continue to mitigate the remaining supply chain exposures. We believe these mitigating actions have helped us to optimize our access to critical components and meet customer demand for our products as a result of the component shortages and significant supply constraints we saw in past periods. While these mitigating actions have resulted in a decrease of our overall supply chain balances during fiscal 2023, these balances continue to be higher as compared to prior fiscal years.Service Gross MarginOur service gross margin percentage decreased by 0.4 percentage points primarily due to higher headcount-related and delivery costs, partially offset by higher sales volume and favorable mix of service offerings.Our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. Other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services.Gross Margin by SegmentThe following table presents the total gross margin for each segment (in millions, except percentages):AMOUNTPERCENTAGEYears EndedJuly 29, 2023July 30, 2022July 31, 2021July 29, 2023July 30, 2022July 31, 2021Gross margin:Americas$21,350 $19,117 $19,499 63.8 %64.1 %66.9 %EMEA10,016 8,969 8,466 66.2 %65.4 %65.4 %APJC5,424 5,241 4,949 64.4 %65.3 %64.2 %Segment total36,788 33,326 32,914 64.5 %64.6 %66.1 %Unallocated corporate items (1)(1,035)(1,078)(1,020)Total$35,753 $32,248 $31,894 62.7 %62.5 %64.0 % (1) The unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges. We do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments. Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. We experienced a gross margin percentage decrease in our Americas segment due to negative impacts from productivity, partially offset by favorable pricing and favorable product mix. Gross margin in our EMEA segment increased due to favorable pricing, and to a lesser extent, favorable product mix, partially offset by negative impacts from productivity.The APJC segment gross margin percentage decrease was due to negative impacts from productivity and pricing erosion, partially offset by favorable product mix and higher service gross margin.42Table of ContentsResearch and Development (“R&D”), Sales and Marketing, and General and Administrative (“G&A”) ExpensesR&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses are summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages):Years Ended2023 vs. 2022July 29, 2023July 30, 2022July 31, 2021Variance in DollarsVariance in PercentResearch and development$7,551 $6,774 $6,549 $777 11 %Percentage of revenue13.2 %13.1 %13.1 %Sales and marketing9,880 9,085 9,259 795 9 %Percentage of revenue17.3 %17.6 %18.6 %General and administrative2,478 2,101 2,152 377 18 %Percentage of revenue4.3 %4.1 %4.3 %Total$19,909 $17,960 $17,960 $1,949 11 %Percentage of revenue34.9 %34.8 %36.1 %R&D ExpensesR&D expenses increased due to higher headcount-related expenses, higher share-based compensation expense and higher discretionary spending, partially offset by lower contracted services spending and lower acquisitions and divestitures related costs.We continue to invest in R&D in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. If we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal R&D. Sales and Marketing ExpensesSales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to higher headcount-related expenses, higher discretionary spending and higher share-based compensation expense, partially offset by the absence of certain non-recurring charges recognized due to the Russia and Ukraine war in fiscal 2022 and lower contracted services spending.G&A ExpensesG&A expenses increased due to higher headcount-related expenses, higher discretionary spending and higher share-based compensation expense, partially offset by the absence of certain non-recurring charges recognized due to the Russia and Ukraine war in fiscal 2022 and lower acquisition and divestitures related costs.Effect of Foreign CurrencyIn fiscal 2023, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $364 million, or 2.0%, compared with fiscal 2022. Amortization of Purchased Intangible AssetsThe following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets including impairment charges (in millions):Years EndedJuly 29, 2023July 30, 2022July 31, 2021Amortization of purchased intangible assets:Cost of sales$649 $749 $716 Operating expenses282 328 215 Total$931 $1,077 $931 The decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets was primarily due to certain purchased intangible assets that became fully amortized, partially offset by amortization of purchased intangibles from our recent acquisitions.43Table of ContentsRestructuring and Other ChargesThe following table presents restructuring and other charges (in millions):Years EndedJuly 29, 2023July 30, 2022July 31, 2021Restructuring and other charges included in operating expenses$531 $6 $886 In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we announced a restructuring plan in order to rebalance the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas, of which approximately 5% of the global workforce would be impacted. The total pretax charges are estimated to be approximately $700 million. In connection with this restructuring plan, we incurred charges of $535 million during fiscal 2023. We expect the plan to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024. We expect to reinvest substantially all of the costs savings from this restructuring plan in our key priority areas. As a result, the overall cost savings from this restructuring plan are not expected to be material for future periods. Operating IncomeThe following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue (in millions, except percentages):Years EndedJuly 29, 2023July 30, 2022July 31, 2021Operating income$15,031 $13,969 $12,833 Operating income as a percentage of revenue26.4 %27.1 %25.8 %Operating income increased by 8%, and as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased by 0.7 percentage points. The increase in operating income was primarily due to a revenue increase and a gross margin percentage increase (driven by favorable pricing and favorable product mix, partially offset by negative impacts from productivity), partially offset by higher operating expenses. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to an operating expenses percentage increase.Interest and Other Income (Loss), NetInterest Income (Expense), Net The following table summarizes interest income and interest expense (in millions):Years Ended2023 vs. 2022July 29, 2023July 30, 2022July 31, 2021Variance in DollarsInterest income$962 $476 $618 $486 Interest expense(427)(360)(434)(67)Interest income (expense), net$535 $116 $184 $419 Interest income increased driven by higher average balance of cash and available-for-sale debt investments and higher interest rates. The increase in interest expense was driven by higher interest rates, partially offset by a lower average debt balance.Other Income (Loss), Net The components of other income (loss), net, are summarized as follows (in millions):Years Ended2023 vs. 2022July 29, 2023July 30, 2022July 31, 2021Variance in DollarsGains (losses) on investments, net:Available-for-sale debt investments$(21)$9 $53 $(30)Marketable equity investments37 (38)6 75 Privately held investments(193)486 266 (679)Net gains (losses) on investments(177)457 325 (634)Other gains (losses), net(71)(65)(80)(6)Other income (loss), net$(248)$392 $245 $(640)The decrease in our other income (loss), net was primarily driven by realized and unrealized losses and impairment charges on our privately held investments and changes in net gains (losses) on our available-for-sale debt investments and marketable equity investments.44Table of ContentsProvision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 17.7% for fiscal 2023, compared with 18.4% for fiscal 2022. The net 0.7 percentage points decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in U.S. foreign-derived intangible income deduction benefit driven by the capitalization and amortization of R&D expenses effective for fiscal 2023 as required by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Tax Act”) partially offset by a decrease in the U.S. federal research tax credit and stock compensation windfall benefit.For a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.45Table of ContentsLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowsCash and Cash Equivalents and Investments The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments (in millions): July 29, 2023July 30, 2022Increase (Decrease)Cash and cash equivalents$10,123 $7,079 $3,044 Available-for-sale debt investments15,592 11,947 3,645 Marketable equity securities431 241 190 Total$26,146 $19,267 $6,879 The net increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by cash provided by operating activities of $19.9 billion. This source of cash was partially offset by cash returned to stockholders in the form of cash dividends of $6.3 billion and repurchases of common stock of $4.3 billion under the stock repurchase program, a net decrease in debt of $1.1 billion, capital expenditures of $0.8 billion and net cash paid for acquisitions and divestitures of $0.3 billion.In February 2023, an IRS announcement related to the California floods (IR-2023-33) deferred our remaining fiscal 2023 U.S. federal income tax payment deadlines until October 2023. Beginning in fiscal 2023, we were required to capitalize and amortize R&D expenses as required by the Tax Act. This change would have resulted in significantly higher cash paid for income taxes during fiscal 2023 absent the payment deferral. As of July 29, 2023, we have deferred approximately $2.8 billion of federal tax payments. Our cash paid for income taxes for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 will significantly increase as a result of these deferred federal tax payments.We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below.Securities Lending We periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale debt investments. These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. We did not experience any losses in connection with the secured lending of securities during the periods presented. As of July 29, 2023 and July 30, 2022, we had no outstanding securities lending transactions.Free Cash Flow and Capital Allocation As part of our capital allocation strategy, we target to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our stockholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment. The following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions):Years EndedJuly 29, 2023July 30, 2022July 31, 2021Net cash provided by operating activities$19,886 $13,226 $15,454 Acquisition of property and equipment(849)(477)(692)Free cash flow$19,037 $12,749 $14,762 We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment 46Table of Contentslinearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. For additional discussion, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report.We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do.

Any future dividends are subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. The remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program is approximately $10.9 billion, with no termination date.

Inventory Supply Chain The following table summarizes our inventories and inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in millions): July 29, 2023July 30, 2022July 31, 2021Variance vs. July 30, 2022Variance vs. July 31, 2021Inventories$3,644 $2,568 $1,559 $1,076 $2,085 Inventory purchase commitments$7,253 $12,964 $10,254 $(5,711)$(3,001)Inventory deposits and prepayments$1,109 $1,484 $162 $(375)$947 The following table summarizes our inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers by period (in millions): July 29, 2023July 30, 2022July 31, 2021Variance vs. July 30, 2022Variance vs. July 31, 2021Less than 1 year$5,270 $9,954 $6,903 $(4,684)$(1,633)1 to 3 years1,783 2,240 1,806 (457)(23)3 to 5 years200 770 1,545 (570)(1,345)Total$7,253 $12,964 $10,254 $(5,711)$(3,001)47Table of ContentsInventory as of July 29, 2023 increased by 42% and inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by 44% from our balances at the end of fiscal 2022. The combined decrease of 30% in our inventory and inventory purchase commitments as compared with the end of fiscal 2022 was primarily due to fulfillment of customer demand as overall supply constraints improved and our continued efforts to work with contract manufacturers and suppliers to optimize our inventory and purchase commitment levels.We increased our balances in prior fiscal years in order to address significant supply constraints seen industry-wide. The increases were primarily due to arrangements to secure supply and pricing for certain product components and commitments with contract manufacturers to meet customer demand and to address extended lead times, as well as advance payments with suppliers to secure future supply, as a result of the supply constraints. As discussed, our risks of future material excess and obsolete inventory and related losses are further outlined in the Result of Operations—Product Gross Margin section.We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. Our inventory purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of our inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure supply and pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed.Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of supply constraints, rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and inventory purchase commitments is appropriate for our current and expected customer demand and revenue levels.Financing Receivables and Guarantees The following table summarizes our financing receivables (in millions): July 29, 2023July 30, 2022Increase (Decrease)Loan receivables, net$5,857 $6,739 $(882)Lease receivables, net978 1,175 (197)Total, net$6,835 $7,914 $(1,079)Financing Receivables Our financing arrangements include loans and leases. Our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware, software and services (including technical support and advanced services), and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. Lease receivables include sales-type leases. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Financing receivables decreased by 14%.Financing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, with payment terms generally ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. The volume of channel partner financing was $32.1 billion, $27.9 billion, and $26.7 billion in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion as of July 29, 2023 and July 30, 2022, respectively. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. As of July 29, 2023, 48Table of Contentsthe total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $159 million, of which approximately $34 million was recorded as deferred revenue.BorrowingsSenior Notes The following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes (in millions): Maturity DateJuly 29, 2023July 30, 2022Senior notes:Fixed-rate notes:2.60%February 28, 2023$— $500 2.20%September 20, 2023750 750 3.625%March 4, 20241,000 1,000 3.50%June 15, 2025500 500 2.95%February 28, 2026750 750 2.50%September 20, 20261,500 1,500 5.90%February 15, 20392,000 2,000 5.50%January 15, 20402,000 2,000 Total$8,500 $9,000 Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of July 29, 2023.Commercial Paper We have a short-term debt financing program in which up to $10.0 billion is available through the issuance of commercial paper notes. We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of July 29, 2023 and $0.6 billion outstanding as of July 30, 2022.Credit Facility On May 13, 2021, we entered into a 5-year credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on May 13, 2026. As of July 29, 2023, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit agreement. On April 18, 2023, we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement to replace the LIBOR index with Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR).Any advances under the 5-year credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (a) with respect to loans in U.S. dollars, (i) Term SOFR (plus a 0.10% credit spread adjustment) or (ii) the Base Rate (to be defined as the highest of (x) the Bank of America prime rate, (y) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50% and (z) Term SOFR plus 1.0%), (b) with respect to loans in Euros, EURIBOR, (c) with respect to loans in Yen, TIBOR and (d) with respect to loans in Pounds Sterling, SONIA, plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., provided that in no event will the interest rate be less than 0.0%. We will pay a quarterly commitment fee during the term of the 5-year credit agreement which may vary depending on our senior debt credit ratings. In addition, the 5-year credit agreement incorporates certain sustainability-linked metrics. Specifically, our applicable interest rate and commitment fee are subject to upward or downward adjustments if we achieve, or fail to achieve, certain specified targets based on two key performance indicator metrics: (i) social impact and (ii) foam reduction. We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and, at our option, extend the maturity of the facility for an additional year up to two times. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement.49Table of ContentsRemaining Performance Obligations The following table presents the breakdown of remaining performance obligations (in millions): July 29, 2023July 30, 2022Increase (Decrease)Product$15,802 $14,090 $1,712 Service19,066 17,449 1,617 Total$34,868 $31,539 $3,329 Short-term RPO$17,910 $16,936 $974 Long-term RPO16,958 14,603 2,355 Total$34,868 $31,539 $3,329 Total remaining performance obligations increased 11% in fiscal 2023. Remaining performance obligations for product increased 12% and remaining performance obligations for service increased 9%, compared to fiscal 2022. We expect approximately 51% of total remaining performance obligations to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months.Deferred Revenue The following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue (in millions): July 29, 2023July 30, 2022Increase (Decrease)Product$11,505 $10,427 $1,078 Service14,045 12,837 1,208 Total$25,550 $23,264 $2,286 Reported as:Current$13,908 $12,784 $1,124 Noncurrent11,642 10,480 1,162 Total$25,550 $23,264 $2,286 Total deferred revenue increased 10% in fiscal 2023. The increase in deferred product revenue of 10% was primarily due to increased deferrals related to our recurring software offerings. The increase in deferred service revenue of 9% was driven by higher business volume and the impact of contract renewals, partially offset by amortization of deferred service revenue.Contractual ObligationsThe impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. In addition, we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at July 29, 2023 (in millions): PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIODJuly 29, 2023TotalLess than 1 Year1 to 3 Years3 to 5 YearsMore than 5 YearsOperating leases$1,116 $341 $426 $172 $177 Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers7,253 5,270 1,783 200 — Other purchase obligations2,476 1,222 976 265 13 Senior notes8,500 1,750 1,250 1,500 4,000 Transition tax payable5,456 1,364 4,092 — — Other long-term liabilities1,365 — 215 166 984 Total by period$26,166 $9,947 $8,742 $2,303 $5,174 Other long-term liabilities (uncertainty in the timing of future payments)1,726 Total$27,892 50Table of ContentsOperating Leases For more information on our operating leases, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. Our inventory purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of our inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure supply and pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in “Inventory Supply Chain.” Other Purchase Obligations Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations.Long-Term Debt The amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Transition Tax Payable Transition tax payable represents future cash tax payments associated with the one-time U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries as a result of the Tax Act.Other Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $1.7 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $62 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Other CommitmentsIn connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our privately held investments, some of which may be based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones or are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $0.3 billion and $0.4 billion as of July 29, 2023 and July 30, 2022, respectively.In the ordinary course of business, we have privately held investments and provide financing to certain customers. Certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our privately held investments and customer financings, and we have determined that as of July 29, 2023 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities.On an ongoing basis, we reassess our privately held investments and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing Receivables and Guarantees.”Liquidity and Capital Resource RequirementsBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs (including inventory and other supply related payments), capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, pending acquisitions, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. We expect increased payments related to inventory and other supply related payments through at least the next 12 months. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources. 51Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskOur financial position is exposed to a variety of risks, including interest rate risk, equity price risk, and foreign currency exchange risk.Interest Rate RiskAvailable-for-Sale Debt Investments We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our primary objective for holding available-for-sale debt investments is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk. At any time, a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates, including the impact from lower credit spreads, could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives. We had no outstanding hedging instruments for our available-for-sale debt investments as of July 29, 2023. Our available-for-sale debt investments are held for purposes other than trading. Our available-for-sale debt investments are not leveraged as of July 29, 2023. We monitor our interest rate and credit risks, including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong.The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our available-for-sale debt investments, including the hedging effects when applicable, as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates. The market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), plus 100 BPS, and plus 150 BPS. The hypothetical fair values as of July 29, 2023 and July 30, 2022 are as follows (in millions): VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTSFAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 29, 2023VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS)(100 BPS)(50 BPS)50 BPS100 BPS150 BPSAvailable-for-sale debt investments$15,901$15,798$15,695$15,592$15,489$15,386$15,284 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTSFAIR VALUEAS OF JULY 30, 2022VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS)(100 BPS)(50 BPS)50 BPS100 BPS150 BPSAvailable-for-sale debt investments$12,263$12,158$12,052$11,947$11,841$11,735$11,630Financing Receivables As of July 29, 2023, our financing receivables had a carrying value of $6.8 billion, compared with $7.9 billion as of July 30, 2022. As of July 29, 2023, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.1 billion, respectively. Debt As of July 29, 2023, we had $8.5 billion in principal amount of senior fixed-rate notes outstanding. The carrying amount of the senior notes was $8.4 billion, and the related fair value based on market prices was $8.7 billion. As of July 29, 2023, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed-rate debt, excluding the $1.5 billion of hedged debt, by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.3 billion, respectively. However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed-rate debt that is not hedged.Equity Price RiskMarketable Equity Investments The fair value of our marketable equity investments is subject to market price volatility. We hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio. These equity securities are held for purposes other than trading. The total fair value of our marketable equity securities was $431 million and $241 million as of July 29, 2023 and July 30, 2022, respectively.Privately Held Investments These investments are recorded in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of July 29, 2023, the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held investments was $1.8 billion, compared with $1.9 billion at July 30, 2022. Some of these companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of privately held investments is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including, among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return. 52Table of ContentsForeign Currency Exchange RiskOur foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at fiscal year-end are summarized in U.S. dollar equivalents as follows (in millions): July 29, 2023July 30, 2022 Notional AmountFair ValueNotional AmountFair ValueForward contracts:Purchased$3,014 $(33)$2,578 $(50)Sold$2,406 $31 $1,943 $50 We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations.Approximately 75% of our operating expenses are U.S.-dollar denominated. In fiscal 2023, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased our combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $364 million, or 2.0%, as compared with fiscal 2022. To reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by non-U.S.-dollar denominated operating expenses and costs, we may hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts. These hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons. In designing a specific hedging approach, we consider several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of exposures, costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument, and potential effectiveness of the hedge. The gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales.We also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities. The market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances. We do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for speculative purposes.53Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:08:50.413915

OVERVIEW We design, manufacture, and sell Internet Protocol (IP)-based networking and other products related to the communications and information technology (IT) industry and provide services associated with these products and their use. Our products and services are designed to address a wide range of customers’ needs, including improving productivity, reducing costs, and gaining a competitive advantage. In addition, our products and services are designed to help customers build their own network infrastructures that support tools and applications that allow them to communicate with key stakeholders, including customers, prospects, business partners, suppliers, and employees. We focus on delivering networking products and solutions that are designed to simplify and secure customers’ network infrastructures. We believe that integrating multiple network services into our products helps our customers reduce their total cost of network ownership. Our product offerings fall into the following four categories: our two core technology categories, Routing and Switching; New Products; and Other Products. In addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service offerings, including technical support services and advanced services. Our customer base spans virtually all types of public and private agencies and businesses, including enterprise businesses (including public sector entities), service providers, commercial customers, and consumers. A summary of our results is as follows (in millions, except percentages and per-share amounts): Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 Variance Net sales $ 43,218 $ 40,040 7.9 % Gross margin percentage 61.4 % 64.0 % (2.6 )pts Research and development $ 5,823 $ 5,273 10.4 % Sales and marketing $ 9,812 $ 8,782 11.7 % General and administrative $ 1,908 $ 1,933 (1.3 )% Total R&D, sales and marketing, general and administrative $ 17,543 $ 15,988 9.7 % Total as a percentage of revenue 40.6 % 39.9 % 0.7 pts Amortization of purchased intangible assets $ 520 $ 491 5.9 % Restructuring and other charges $ 799 $ — NM Operating margin percentage 17.8 % 22.9 % (5.1 )pts Net income $ 6,490 $ 7,767 (16.4 )% Net income as a percentage of revenue 15.0 % 19.4 % (4.4 )pts Earnings per share – diluted $ 1.17 $ 1.33 (12.0 )% 38 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 Net sales increased 8%, with net product sales increasing 6% and service revenue increasing 14%. We experienced net sales increases across each of our geographic segments for both product and service revenue. Total gross margin declined by 2.6 percentage points primarily as a result of higher sales discounts and unfavorable product pricing, product mix shifts, increased amortization and impairment charges from acquisition-related intangible assets, and restructuring charges. As a percentage of revenue, the total for research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses increased by 0.7 percentage points, primarily as a result of increased headcount-related costs. Total charges for restructuring and other in fiscal 2011 totaled $923 million, which consisted of $124 million recorded to cost of sales and $799 million recorded to operating expenses. Diluted earnings per share decreased by 12%, a result of a 16% decrease in net income, partially offset by a decline in our diluted share count of 285 million shares. For further details, see our Discussion of Fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 beginning on page 50. During fiscal 2011 net sales increased as compared to fiscal 2010; however, our results for the year reflect the effects of certain challenges that we faced. We identified challenges with the public sector market early in the year and we continued to experience declining business momentum with that market throughout the year as spending reductions were being taken across virtually all developed markets. In the service provider market, we experienced challenges in sales of traditional set-top boxes. In addition, we experienced challenges with regard to switching, as switching revenue was flat for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. We believe the performance in switching was due to continued transitions taking place in our product portfolio, the lower public sector spending, and the impact of increased competitive pressures. In fiscal 2011 switching gross margins declined on a year-over-year basis due to the transition of products at the high-end of the portfolio. We also identified significant pressures in our consumer market during the fiscal year and addressed these issues with targeted actions, as discussed below. Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we initiated a number of key, targeted actions that are intended to accomplish the following: simplify and focus our organization and operating model; align our cost structure to the transitions in the marketplace; divest or exit underperforming operations; and deliver value to our shareholders. We are taking these actions to align our business based on five foundational priorities: leadership in our core business (routing, switching, and associated services), which includes comprehensive security and mobility solutions; collaboration; data center virtualization and cloud; video; and architectures for business transformation. In connection with these activities, we incurred restructuring and other charges, as discussed above, in the second half of fiscal 2011, and we have announced that we will incur additional charges in fiscal 2012. These actions include implementing a voluntary early retirement program, effecting a workforce reduction, and realigning and restructuring our consumer business, most notably exiting our Flip Video cameras product line. We anticipate that our total expense reduction actions will reduce our annualized operating expense run rate by approximately $1 billion, with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 operating expenses as our base. We expect to achieve this annualized run rate reduction target within fiscal 2012. While we experienced the challenges outlined above, there were several positive aspects to our fiscal 2011 performance. For fiscal 2011, the Emerging Markets segment experienced revenue growth of 14%. We had strong growth in our commercial market and in our enterprise market (excluding the public sector). Positive aspects of our results for fiscal 2011 also included revenue growth in New Products of 14%, with strong growth of 31% in collaboration (which includes the impact of the Tandberg ASA (“Tandberg”) acquisition completed at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2010) and 44% in data center, both key strategic areas for us. For fiscal 2011, service revenue increased by 14%. In addition, as we focused on and addressed the items that impacted our financial performance in the first three quarters of fiscal 2011, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 there was improvement in our general business momentum. 39 Table of Contents Strategy and Focus Areas We announced a plan in May 2011, which we began implementing in fiscal 2011 and expect to complete in fiscal 2012, to realign our sales, services and engineering organizations in order to simplify our operating model and focus on our five foundational priorities: • Leadership in our core business (routing, switching, and associated services) which includes comprehensive security and mobility solutions • Collaboration • Data center virtualization and cloud • Video • Architectures for business transformation We believe that focusing on these priorities will best position us to continue to expand our share of our customers’ information technology spending. We are currently undergoing product transitions in our core business and introducing next-generation products with higher price performance and architectural advantages compared to both our prior generation of products and the product offerings of our competitors. We believe that many of these product transitions are gaining momentum based on the strong year-over-year product revenue growth across these next-generation product families. We believe that our strategy and our ability to innovate and execute may enable us to improve our relative competitive position in many of our product areas even in uncertain or difficult business conditions and, therefore, may continue to provide us with long-term growth opportunities. However, we believe that these newly introduced products may continue to negatively impact product gross margins, which we are currently striving to address through various initiatives including value engineering, effective supply chain management, and delivering greater customer value through offers that include hardware, software, and services. We continue to seek to capitalize on market transitions. Market transitions on which we are primarily focused include those related to the increased role of virtualization/the cloud, video, collaboration, networked mobility technologies and the transition from Internet Protocol Version 4 to Internet Protocol Version 6. For example, a market in which a significant market transition is under way is the enterprise data center market, where a transition to virtualization/the cloud is rapidly evolving. There is a continued growing awareness that intelligent networks are becoming the platform for productivity improvement and global competitiveness. We believe that disruption in the enterprise data center market is accelerating, due to changing technology trends such as the increasing adoption of virtualization, the rise in scalable processing, and the advent of cloud computing and cloud-based IT resource deployments and business models. These key terms are defined as follows: Virtualization: refers to the process of aggregating the current siloed data center resources into unified, shared resource pools that can be dynamically delivered to applications on demand thus enabling the ability to move content and applications between devices and the network. The cloud: refers to an information technology hosting and delivery system in which resources, such as servers or software applications, are no longer tethered to a user’s physical infrastructure but instead are delivered to and consumed by the user “on demand” as an Internet-based service, whether singularly or with multiple other users simultaneously. This virtualization and cloud-driven market transition in the enterprise data center market is being brought about through the convergence of networking, computing, storage, and software technologies. We are seeking to take advantage of this market transition through, among other things, our Cisco Unified Computing System platform and Cisco Nexus product families, which are designed to integrate the previously siloed technologies in the enterprise data center with a unified architecture. We are also seeking to capitalize on this market transition through the development of other cloud-based product and service offerings through which we intend to enable customers to develop and deploy their own cloud-based IT solutions, including software-as-a-service (SaaS) and other-as-a-service (XaaS) solutions. 40 Table of Contents The competitive landscape in the enterprise data center market is changing. Very large, well-financed, and aggressive competitors are each bringing their own new class of products to address this new market. We expect this competitive market trend to continue. With respect to this market, we believe the network will be the intersection of innovation through an open ecosystem and standards. We expect to see acquisitions, further industry consolidation, and new alliances among companies as they seek to serve the enterprise data center market. As we enter this next market phase, we expect that we will strengthen certain strategic alliances, compete more with certain strategic alliances and partners, and perhaps also encounter new competitors in our attempt to deliver the best solutions for our customers. Other market transitions on which we are focusing particular attention include those related to the increased role of video, collaboration, and networked mobility technologies. The key market transitions relative to the convergence of video, collaboration, and networked mobility technologies, which we believe will drive productivity and growth in network loads, appear to be evolving even more quickly and more significantly than we had previously anticipated. Cisco TelePresence systems are one example of product offerings that have incorporated video, collaboration, and networked mobility technologies, as customers evolve their communications and business models. We are focused on simplifying and expanding the creation, distribution, and use of end-to-end video solutions for businesses and consumers. We believe that the architectural approach that has served us well in the past in addressing market opportunities in the communications and IT industry will be adaptable to other markets. An example of a market where we aim to apply this approach is mobility, where growth of IP traffic on handheld devices is driving the need for more robust architectures, equipment and services in order to accommodate not only an increasing number of worldwide mobile device users, but also increased user demand for broadband-quality business network and consumer web applications to be delivered on such devices. Revenue For fiscal 2011, total revenue increased by 8%. Within total revenue, net product revenue increased 6% and net service revenue increased 14%, each as compared with fiscal 2010. With regard to our geographic segment performance, net revenue increased 6% in the United States and Canada segment, 6% in our European Markets segment, 14% in our Emerging Markets segment, and 12% in our Asia Pacific Markets segment. Customer market product revenue performance in fiscal 2011 was driven by increases, in order of largest percentage growth, in our commercial, service provider, and enterprise markets. Our consumer market experienced a large revenue decline in fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, as we exited the Flip Video cameras business and experienced weakness in sales of our networked home products. The 6% increase in product revenue was driven by growth across most of our product categories. In particular, our New Products category experienced a revenue increase of 14%, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Tandberg, which was completed at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Within the New Products category, increased revenue was driven by growth of 44% in data center and revenue growth of 31% in collaboration. In our core product categories we experienced revenue growth of 6% in Routers, principally as a result of strength in the high-end router product offerings, and flat revenue in our Switches product category, with single-digit revenue growth in fixed-configuration switching products being offset by a similar revenue decline in modular switches. The net service revenue increase was experienced across the technical support services and advanced services categories with revenue increases of 12% and 21%, respectively, in fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010. For further details see our Discussion of Fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 beginning on page 50. Gross Margin In fiscal 2011, our gross margin percentage decreased by approximately 2.6 percentage points, as compared with fiscal 2010. Within this total gross margin change, product gross margin declined by 3.7 percentage points, while service gross margin increased by 1.5 percentage points. The decrease in our product gross margin percentage was a result of higher sales discounts and unfavorable product pricing, unfavorable product mix, and 41 Table of Contents restructuring and other charges. Additionally, increased amortization expense and impairment charges from purchased intangible assets contributed to the decline in product gross margin. Partially offsetting these decreases were lower overall manufacturing costs and higher shipment volume. The increase in our service gross margin was due to increased volume, partially offset by increased costs and unfavorable mix impacts. For further details see our Discussion of Fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 beginning on page 50. Operating Expenses Total operating expenses in fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, increased by 14%. In fiscal 2011, research and development expenses increased 10%, sales and marketing expenses increased 12%, while general and administrative expenses were down slightly. The collective increase was primarily a result of higher headcount-related expenses. This increase was partially offset by the impact from the fiscal 2011 period containing one less week compared with the fiscal 2010 period. Operating expense as a percentage of revenue increased by 2.4 percentage points, primarily as a result of restructuring and other charges and the higher headcount-related charges along with increased expense from purchased intangible asset amortization and impairments. Other Key Financial Measures The following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2011: • We generated cash flows from operations of $10.1 billion, compared with $10.2 billion in fiscal 2010. Our cash and cash equivalents, together with our investments, were $44.6 billion at the end of fiscal 2011, compared with $39.9 billion at the end of fiscal 2010. • Our total deferred revenue at the end of 2011 was $12.2 billion, compared with $11.1 billion at the end of fiscal 2010. • We repurchased approximately 351 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $19.36 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $6.8 billion during fiscal 2011. As of the end of fiscal 2011, the remaining authorized repurchase amount under the stock repurchase program was $10.2 billion with no termination date. We also declared and paid dividends of $658 million to our shareholders during fiscal 2011. • Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable (DSO) at the end of fiscal 2011 was 38 days, compared with 41 days at the end of fiscal 2010. • Our inventory balance was $1.5 billion at the end of fiscal 2011, compared with $1.3 billion at the end of fiscal 2010. Annualized inventory turns were 11.8 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, compared with 12.6 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. • Our product backlog at the end of fiscal 2011 was $4.3 billion, or 10% of fiscal 2011 net sales, compared with $4.1 billion at the end of fiscal 2010, or 10% of fiscal 2010 net sales. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. 42 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met: • Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Contracts, Internet commerce agreements, and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement. • Delivery has occurred. Shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery. • The fee is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. • Collectibility is reasonably assured. We assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer’s payment history. In instances where final acceptance of the product, system, or solution is specified by the customer, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. When a sale involves multiple deliverables, such as sales of products that include services, the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting, and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price. Revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met. The amount of product and service revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and, if so, our valuation of the units of accounting for multiple deliverables. According to the accounting guidance prescribed in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605, Revenue Recognition, we use vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE) for each of those units, when available. We determine VSOE based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range, generally evidenced by approximately 80% of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus 15% of the median selling price. VSOE exists across most of our product and service offerings. In certain limited circumstances when VSOE does not exist, we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multiple-deliverable arrangements. Under the selling price hierarchy, third-party evidence of selling price (TPE) will be considered if VSOE does not exist, and estimated selling price (ESP) will be used if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Generally, we are not able to determine TPE because our go-to-market strategy differs from that of others in our markets, and the extent of customization varies among comparable products or services from our peers. In determining ESP, we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors, based on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement. We typically arrive at an ESP for a product or service that is not sold separately by considering company-specific factors such as geographies, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives, pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing, and existing portfolio pricing and discounting. Some of our sales arrangements have multiple deliverables containing software and related software support components. Such sale arrangements are subject to the accounting guidance in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition. As our business and offerings evolve over time, our pricing practices may be required to be modified accordingly, which could result in changes in selling prices, including both VSOE and ESP, in subsequent periods. There were no material impacts during fiscal 2011, nor do we currently expect a material impact in fiscal 2012 on our revenue recognition due to any changes in our VSOE, TPE, or ESP. Revenue deferrals relate to the timing of revenue recognition for specific transactions based on financing arrangements, service, support, and other factors. Financing arrangements may include sales-type, direct-financing, and operating leases, loans, and guarantees of third-party financing. Our deferred revenue for products was $3.7 billion as of both July 30, 2011 and July 31, 2010. Technical support services revenue is deferred and 43 Table of Contents recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed, which typically is from one to three years. Advanced services revenue is recognized upon delivery or completion of performance. Our deferred revenue for services was $8.5 billion and $7.4 billion as of July 30, 2011 and July 31, 2010, respectively. We make sales to distributors and retail partners and generally recognize revenue based on a sell-through method using information provided by them. Our distributors and retail partners participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs. If actual credits received by our distributors and retail partners under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected. Allowances for Receivables and Sales Returns The allowances for receivables were as follows (in millions, except percentages): July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Allowance for doubtful accounts $ 204 $ 235 Percentage of gross accounts receivable 4.2 % 4.6 % Allowance for credit loss—lease receivables $ 237 $ 207 Percentage of gross lease receivables 7.6 % 8.6 % Allowance for credit loss—loan receivables $ 103 $ 73 Percentage of gross loan receivables 7.0 % 5.8 % The allowances are based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience, credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay, historical default rates, and long-term historical loss rates published by major third-party credit-rating agencies. We also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances. In addition, we evaluate the credit quality of our financing receivables and any associated allowance for credit loss by applying the relevant loss factors based on our internal credit risk rating for the respective financing receivables, disaggregated by segment and class. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Determination of loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings is complex and subjective. Our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Similarly, if a major customer’s creditworthiness deteriorates, if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, or if other circumstances arise, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, and additional allowances could be required, which could have an adverse impact on our revenue. Both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible. The decline in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of our gross accounts receivable was primarily due to the charge-off of certain uncollectible receivables that had been fully reserved. A reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. The reserve for future sales returns as of July 30, 2011 and July 31, 2010 was $106 million and $90 million, respectively, and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable. If the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established, our revenue could be adversely affected. Inventory Valuation and Liability for Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers Our inventory balance was $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion as of July 30, 2011 and July 31, 2010, respectively. Inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a 44 Table of Contents component of our cost of sales. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. As of July 30, 2011, the liability for these purchase commitments was $168 million, compared with $135 million as of July 31, 2010, and was included in other current liabilities. Our provision for inventory was $196 million, $94 million, and $93 million for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was $114 million, $8 million, and $87 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The increase in the provision for inventory and the provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was due in part to charges recorded in connection with the restructuring and realignment of our consumer business. Additionally, the provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased due to higher provisions related to certain component supplies that we secured for our extended needs, and due to higher contract manufacturer excess and obsolescence charges. If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we could be required to increase our inventory write-downs, and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and accordingly gross margin could be adversely affected. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments. Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence, particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainties and conditions and the resulting potential for changes in future demand forecast. Warranty Costs The liability for product warranties, included in other current liabilities, was $342 million as of July 30, 2011, compared with $360 million as of July 31, 2010. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years, and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty. We accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs, technical support labor costs, and associated overhead. Material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment. Technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period. Overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities. The provision for product warranties issued during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 was $456 million, $469 million, and $374 million, respectively. If we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected, our gross margin could be adversely affected. Share-Based Compensation Expense Share-based compensation expense is presented as follows (in millions): Years Ended July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 July 25, 2009 Share-based compensation expense $ 1,620 $ 1,517 $ 1,231 Prior to the initial declaration of a quarterly cash dividend on March 17, 2011, the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units was measured based on an expected dividend yield of 0% as we did not historically pay 45 Table of Contents cash dividends on our common stock. For awards granted on or subsequent to March 17, 2011, we used an annualized dividend yield based on the per share dividends declared by our Board of Directors. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The determination of the fair value of employee stock options and employee stock purchase rights on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. For employee stock options and employee stock purchase rights, these variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends as of the grant date. For employee stock options, we used the implied volatility for two-year traded options on our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the lattice-binomial model. For employee stock purchase rights, we used the implied volatility for traded options (with lives corresponding to the expected life of the employee stock purchase rights) on our stock. The selection of the implied volatility approach was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. The valuation of employee stock options is also impacted by kurtosis and skewness, which are technical measures of the distribution of stock price returns and the actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. Because share-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for forfeitures. If factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of our option-pricing model in future periods or if we experience different forfeiture rates, the compensation expense that is derived may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current year. Fair Value Measurements Our fixed income and publicly traded equity securities, collectively, are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at a fair value of $36.9 billion as of July 30, 2011, compared with $35.3 billion as of July 31, 2010. Our fixed income investment portfolio, as of July 30, 2011, consisted primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As described more fully in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a valuation hierarchy is based on the level of independent, objective evidence available regarding the value of the investments. It encompasses three classes of investments: Level 1 consists of securities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical securities; Level 2 consists of securities for which observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs are used, such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets and model-derived valuations for which the variables are derived from, or corroborated by, observable market data; and Level 3 consists of securities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value. Our Level 2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. We use inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from independent pricing vendors, quoted market prices, or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities. We use such pricing data as the primary input, to which we have not made any material adjustments during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio. We are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates. The inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness, may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information, and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to its estimate of fair value. The assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective. However, given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio, and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets, we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of subjectivity and judgment was 46 Table of Contents material to the valuation of the investment portfolio as of July 30, 2011. Level 3 assets do not represent a significant portion of our total investment portfolio as of July 30, 2011. Other-than-Temporary Impairments We recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary. The ultimate value realized on these securities, to the extent unhedged, is subject to market price volatility until they are sold. If the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary. An impairment is considered other than temporary if (i) we have the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on (i) or (ii) described in the prior sentence, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (iii), the amount representing credit loss, defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security, will be recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). In estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected, we consider all available information, including past events, current conditions, the remaining payment terms of the security, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults, and the value of underlying collateral. For publicly traded equity securities, we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. There were no significant impairment charges on our investments in publicly traded equity securities in fiscal 2011 and 2010. There were no impairment charges on investments in fixed income securities in fiscal 2011 and 2010. In fiscal 2009, impairment charges of $258 million for investments in fixed income securities and publicly traded equity securities were recognized in earnings. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. We also have investments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages. As of July 30, 2011, our investments in privately held companies were $796 million, compared with $756 million as of July 31, 2010, and were included in other assets. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment and will make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required, based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. Our impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were $10 million, $25 million, and $85 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Asset Impairments Our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. Effective in fiscal 2010, the assessment 47 Table of Contents of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets. The goodwill recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 30, 2011 and July 31, 2010 was $16.8 billion and $16.7 billion, respectively. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. As a result of the pending divestiture of our manufacturing operations in Juarez, Mexico, we recorded an adjustment of $63 million to reduce goodwill associated with these operations. There was no impairment of goodwill resulting from our annual impairment testing in fiscal 2011, 2010 or 2009. The excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units ranged from approximately $7 billion for the Asia Pacific Markets segment to approximately $12 billion for the United States and Canada segment as of July 30, 2011. We performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit as of July 30, 2011 would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were $164 million, $28 million, and $95 million during fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, research and development (R&D) tax credits, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, international realignments, and transfer pricing adjustments. Our effective tax rate was 17.1%, 17.5%, and 20.3% in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest. Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event 48 Table of Contents that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by expiration of or lapses in the R&D tax credit laws; by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany R&D cost-sharing arrangement and legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible U.S. changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. Loss Contingencies We are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 49 Table of Contents DISCUSSION OF FISCAL 2011, 2010, AND 2009 Fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 were 52, 53, and 52-week fiscal years, respectively. Net Sales The following table presents the breakdown of net sales between product and service revenue (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Variancein Dollars Variancein Percent July 31, 2010 July 25, 2009 Variancein Dollars Variancein Percent Net sales: Product $ 34,526 $ 32,420 $ 2,106 6.5 % $ 32,420 $ 29,131 $ 3,289 11.3 % Percentage of net sales 79.9 % 81.0 % 81.0 % 80.7 % Service 8,692 7,620 1,072 14.1 % 7,620 6,986 634 9.1 % Percentage of net sales 20.1 % 19.0 % 19.0 % 19.3 % Total $ 43,218 $ 40,040 $ 3,178 7.9 % $ 40,040 $ 36,117 $ 3,923 10.9 % We manage our business primarily on a geographic basis, organized into four geographic segments. Our net sales, which include product and service revenue for each segment are summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Variancein Dollars Variancein Percent July 31, 2010 July 25, 2009 Variancein Dollars Variancein Percent Net sales: United States and Canada $ 23,115 $ 21,740 $ 1,375 6.3 % $ 21,740 $ 19,345 $ 2,395 12.4 % Percentage of net sales 53.5 % 54.3 % 54.3 % 53.5 % European Markets 8,536 8,048 488 6.1 % 8,048 7,683 365 4.8 % Percentage of net sales 19.8 % 20.1 % 20.1 % 21.3 % Emerging Markets 4,966 4,367 599 13.7 % 4,367 3,999 368 9.2 % Percentage of net sales 11.4 % 10.9 % 10.9 % 11.1 % Asia Pacific Markets 6,601 5,885 716 12.2 % 5,885 5,090 795 15.6 % Percentage of net sales 15.3 % 14.7 % 14.7 % 14.1 % Total $ 43,218 $ 40,040 $ 3,178 7.9 % $ 40,040 $ 36,117 $ 3,923 10.9 % Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, net sales increased by 8%. Within total net sales growth, net product sales increased by 6%, while service revenue increased by 14%. Our product and service revenue totals each reflected sales growth across each of our geographic segments. The sales increase was due to customer acceptance of the new product transitions taking place in our core business, sales growth in our New Products category, and the strong performance of our services solutions. We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on sales has not been material because our sales are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our sales to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations. In addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced IT spending environment and budget-driven reductions in spending by government entities, net sales by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions 50 Table of Contents such as multiple-element arrangements; the mix of financing arrangements provided to our channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the net sales related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the net sales of the relevant segment. As has been the case in our Emerging Markets segment from time to time, customers require greater levels of financing arrangements, service, and support and this may occur in future periods, which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue. Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 Net sales increased across all of our geographic segments in fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009. In our view, the sales increase in fiscal 2010 was a result of the global demand recovery during fiscal 2010 in comparison to the weakness we experienced for most of fiscal 2009. We had an increase in both net product sales and service revenue in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. From a customer market perspective, in fiscal 2010 we saw an improved demand environment for capital expenditures and balanced growth across all of our customer markets. Net Product Sales by Segment The following table presents the breakdown of net product sales by segment (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Variancein Dollars Variancein Percent July 31, 2010 July 25, 2009 Variancein Dollars Variancein Percent Net product sales: United States and Canada $ 17,705 $ 16,915 $ 790 4.7 % $ 16,915 $ 14,866 $ 2,049 13.8 % Percentage of net product sales 51.3 % 52.2 % 52.2 % 51.0 % European Markets 7,200 6,821 379 5.6 % 6,821 6,579 242 3.7 % Percentage of net product sales 20.9 % 21.0 % 21.0 % 22.6 % Emerging Markets 4,174 3,728 446 12.0 % 3,728 3,377 351 10.4 % Percentage of net product sales 12.0 % 11.5 % 11.5 % 11.6 % Asia Pacific Markets 5,447 4,956 491 9.9 % 4,956 4,309 647 15.0 % Percentage of net product sales 15.8 % 15.3 % 15.3 % 14.8 % Total $ 34,526 $ 32,420 $ 2,106 6.5 % $ 32,420 $ 29,131 $ 3,289 11.3 % United States and Canada Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, net product sales in the United States and Canada segment increased by 5%. Net product sales increased 3% in the United States and increased 31% in Canada. The increase in net product sales was across most of our customer markets in the United States and Canada segment, led by the net product sales growth in our commercial market, followed by smaller increases in net product sales growth in both the service provider and enterprise markets. Net product sales in the consumer market declined during fiscal 2011 as we exited the Flip Video cameras business and experienced weakness in sales of our networked home products. Within the enterprise market, net product sales to the U.S. public sector decreased due to a decrease in sales to the U.S. federal government, while sales to the state and local government submarket were flat. The challenges experienced in fiscal 2011 within the public sector submarket of our enterprise market may continue into fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 Net product sales in the United States and Canada segment increased during fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 due to the improvement in the economic environment in this segment. The increase in net product sales 51 Table of Contents compared with fiscal 2009 was across all of our customer markets in the United States and Canada segment, led by the commercial and enterprise markets. Within the enterprise market, net product sales to the U.S. federal government increased as compared with fiscal 2009. Our net product sales in the consumer market for fiscal 2010 increased compared with fiscal 2009, primarily due to sales of Flip Video cameras from the acquisition of Pure Digital, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. From a product perspective, the increase in fiscal 2010 net product sales in this segment was driven in large part by higher sales of our switching products. European Markets Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, net product sales in the European Markets segment increased by 6%. The increase in net product sales in the European Markets segment was due to growth in the service provider and enterprise markets. Sales to the commercial market were flat, while sales in the consumer market declined for fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010. From a country perspective, for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010, net product sales increased by approximately 17% in France, 13% in the Netherlands, 2% in Germany, 1% in the United Kingdom, and were flat in Italy. Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 The slight increase in net product sales in the European Markets segment in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was driven by increased sales across most of our customer markets in this segment, with particular strength in the enterprise and commercial markets. From a country perspective, net product sales increased in the United Kingdom and France while decreasing for both Germany and Italy compared with fiscal 2009. Our European Markets segment grew more slowly relative to other segments on a year-over-year basis, which we believe was attributable in part to the fact that many of the countries in this segment were among the last countries to begin experiencing the economic downturn in fiscal 2009, and consequently some of these countries are recovering later. Product sales growth in this segment began to strengthen in the second half of fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2010 we did not see significant negative effects on our net product sales in the European Markets segment from the economic and financial turmoil related to sovereign debt issues in certain European countries. Emerging Markets Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, net product sales in the Emerging Markets segment increased by 12%. The net product sales increase was led by a sales increase in the commercial market followed by sales increases in the service provider and enterprise markets. Net product sales in the consumer market declined for fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010. From a country perspective, net product sales increased by approximately 63% in Russia, 20% in Brazil, and 8% in Mexico. Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 Net product sales in the Emerging Markets segment increased, primarily as a result of increased product sales across all of our customer markets, with the exception of the consumer market. We experienced a return to stronger year-over-year sales growth in the second half of fiscal 2010, led by Brazil, Mexico, and Russia. Asia Pacific Markets Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, net product sales in our Asia Pacific Markets segment increased by 10%. The increase was led by sales growth in the commercial and enterprise markets and to a lesser extent sales growth in the service provider market. Net product sales in the consumer market declined for fiscal 2011, as 52 Table of Contents compared with fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2011 we experienced weakness within our public sector market in our Asia Pacific Markets segment. We may continue to experience challenging conditions in the public sector market in fiscal 2012. From a country perspective, net product sales increased by approximately 13% in India, 11% in China, 8% in Australia, and 7% in Japan. Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 The increase in net product sales in the Asia Pacific Markets segment in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was attributable to increased product sales to our enterprise, commercial, and service provider markets in this segment. In fiscal 2010 we experienced strength in most countries, including China, Australia and Japan, each of which is among the largest countries in this segment. Net Product Sales by Groups of Similar Products In addition to the primary view on a geographic basis, we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes. Effective as of the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we have regrouped our presentation of products and technologies formerly grouped as either Advanced Technologies or Other into two new categories called New Products and Other Products. The New Products category includes some products that had previously been grouped in the category called Advanced Technology products and also includes some products that had previously been in the category called Other. The New Products category consists of the following subcategories: video connected home (networked home, Pure Digital products, video systems, and cable products); collaboration (unified communications and Cisco TelePresence); security; wireless; and data center (application networking services, storage, and Cisco Unified Computing System products). The Other Products category consists primarily of optical networking products and emerging technology products. The following table presents net sales for groups of similar products (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Variancein Dollars Variancein Percent July 31, 2010 July 25, 2009 Variancein Dollars Variancein Percent Net product sales: Routers $ 7,100 $ 6,728 $ 372 5.5 % $ 6,728 $ 6,521 $ 207 3.2 % Percentage of net product sales 20.6 % 20.8 % 20.8 % 22.4 % Switches 13,418 13,454 (36 ) (0.3 %) 13,454 11,923 1,531 12.8 % Percentage of net product sales 38.9 % 41.5 % 41.5 % 40.9 % New Products 13,025 11,386 1,639 14.4 % 11,386 9,859 1,527 15.5 % Percentage of net product sales 37.7 % 35.1 % 35.1 % 33.8 % Other Products 983 852 131 15.4 % 852 828 24 2.9 % Percentage of net product sales 2.8 % 2.6 % 2.6 % 2.9 % Total $ 34,526 $ 32,420 $ 2,106 6.5 % $ 32,420 $ 29,131 $ 3,289 11.3 % Routers Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 We categorize our routers primarily as high-end, midrange, and low-end routers. For fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010, growth in sales of our Routers product category was driven by an 8%, or $334 million, increase in sales of our high-end routers. Within high-end router products, the increase was driven by higher sales of Cisco Aggregation Services Routers (ASR) 5000 products from our December 2009 acquisition of Starent and higher sales of the Cisco ASR 1000 and Cisco ASR 9000 products. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of Cisco 12000 Series Routers and Cisco 7600 Series Routers. For fiscal 2011, midrange and low-end routers each increased sales by 2%, or $16 million, and $30 million, respectively, compared with fiscal 2010. Small office routing experienced a small revenue decline. 53 Table of Contents Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 Our sales of routers increased in our high-end category in fiscal 2010 by 10%, or $409 million, while sales of routers declined in both the midrange and low-end categories by 11% and 5%, respectively. Within the high-end router category, the increase was driven by higher sales of the Cisco CRS-1 Carrier Routing System, Cisco 7600 Series Routers, and Cisco ASR 1000 and 9000 products, and the inclusion of the Cisco ASR 5000 products from our acquisition of Starent, partially offset by lower sales of Cisco 12000 Series Routers. Our decline in sales of midrange and low-end routers was primarily due to a decline in sales of our integrated services routers. Switches Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 Net product sales in our Switches product category were relatively flat in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010, which was due to the combined effect of continuing transitions taking place in our product portfolio, lower public sector spending, and the impact of increased competitive pressures. Since approximately 25% of our switching business is derived from sales to the public sector, reductions in public sector spending in developed markets around the world could continue to present challenges for our switching sales performance. Within our Switches product category, higher sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches partially offset lower sales of modular switches. Sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches increased 3%, or $240 million, while sales of modular switches decreased 4%, or $275 million. The increase in LAN fixed-configuration switches was primarily due to increased sales of Cisco Catalyst 2960 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 2000 and 5000 Series Switches, partially offset by decreased sales of Cisco Catalyst 3560 and 3750 Series Switches. The decrease in sales of modular switches was primarily due to decreased sales of Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches, partially offset by increased sales of Cisco Nexus 7000 and Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series Switches. Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 The increase in net product sales related to switches in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was due primarily to higher sales of our modular and LAN fixed-configuration switches of approximately $882 million and $649 million, respectively. The increase in sales of modular switches was primarily due to the increased sales of our Cisco Nexus 7000 and Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series Switches, partially offset by decreased sales of our Cisco Catalyst 6000 Series Switches. The increase in LAN fixed-configuration switches was primarily due to increased sales of Cisco Catalyst 2960 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 5000 and 2000 Series Switches, partially offset by decreased sales of our Cisco Catalyst 3560 Series Switches. New Products Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 • Sales of collaboration products increased by 31%, or $972 million, primarily due to the inclusion of Tandberg sales within our Cisco TelePresence systems product line following our fiscal 2010 third quarter acquisition of Tandberg, and a 4% increase in sales of unified communications products, primarily IP phones and collaborative web-based offerings. • Sales of data center products increased by 44%, or $491 million, due to sales growth of over 273%, or $496 million, of Cisco Unified Computing System products and due to storage sales growth of 9%, or $43 million, attributable to increased sales of our Cisco MDS 9000 product line. These increases were partially offset by a 12% decline in sales of application networking services products. • Sales of wireless products increased by 26%, or $303 million, which was primarily due to continued customer adoption of and migration to the Cisco Unified Wireless Network architecture. • Sales of video connected home products were relatively flat. Sales of service provider video products increased by 6%, or $208 million, as increased sales of cable and cable modem products of 18% and 54 Table of Contents 55%, respectively, were offset by a sales decline in video systems of 1%. The increased sales of service provider video products were partially offset by lower sales of virtual home products, due to a decline of 26% in sales of networked home products and due to an 11% decline in sales of Flip Video cameras, attributable to our exit of the video camera business in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. • Sales of security products decreased by 8%, or $143 million. Our decreased sales of security products were the result of lower sales of module and line cards related to our routers and LAN switches, partially offset by increased sales of our web and email security products. Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 • Sales of video connected home products increased by approximately $359 million due to increased sales of $317 million of Flip Video cameras attributable to our Pure Digital acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, along with a $248 million increase in sales of cable products. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $133 million in sales of networked home products, primarily due to lower sales of routers and adapters, and due to a decline of $57 million in sales of video systems, primarily attributable to lower sales for digital set-top boxes. • Sales of collaboration products increased by approximately $556 million due to an increase of $293 million in sales of unified communications products, primarily due to higher sales of IP phones and associated software, and higher sales of our web-based collaboration offerings. The increase in collaboration products was also due to a sales increase of $263 million in Cisco TelePresence systems products, which was primarily attributable to our acquisition of Tandberg completed at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2010. • Sales of security products increased by approximately $189 million. Our increased sales of security products were a result of increased sales of our web and email security products as well as our security appliance products, each of which integrates multiple technologies (including virtual private network (VPN), firewall, and intrusion-prevention services) on one platform, partially offset by lower sales of module and line-cards related to our routers and LAN switches. • Sales of data center products increased by approximately $249 million due to an increase of $181 million in sales of Cisco Unified Computing System products and an increase of $68 million in sales of storage area networking products. The increase in sales of storage products resulted primarily from higher sales of our Cisco MDS 9000 product line. Sales of application networking services declined; however, the decline was offset by higher server virtualization sales. • Sales of wireless products increased by approximately $174 million, primarily due to increases in the customer adoption of and migration to the Cisco Unified Wireless Network architecture. Other Products Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 The increase in Other Product revenue during fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, was primarily due to a 19% increase in sales of optical networking products and a 17% increase in emerging technology products. Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 The increase in Other Products revenue in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a 99% increase in sales of emerging technology products, partially offset by a 1% decline in sales of optical networking products. 55 Table of Contents Net Service Sales by Segment The following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Variancein Dollars Variancein Percent July 31, 2010 July 25, 2009 Variancein Dollars Variancein Percent Service revenue: United States and Canada $ 5,410 $ 4,825 $ 585 12.1 % $ 4,825 $ 4,479 $ 346 7.7 % Percentage of service revenue 62.2 % 63.3 % 63.3 % 64.1 % European Markets 1,336 1,227 109 8.9 % 1,227 1,104 123 11.1 % Percentage of service revenue 15.4 % 16.1 % 16.1 % 15.8 % Emerging Markets 792 639 153 23.9 % 639 622 17 2.7 % Percentage of service revenue 9.1 % 8.4 % 8.4 % 8.9 % Asia Pacific Markets 1,154 929 225 24.2 % 929 781 148 19.0 % Percentage of service revenue 13.3 % 12.2 % 12.2 % 11.2 % Total $ 8,692 $ 7,620 $ 1,072 14.1 % $ 7,620 $ 6,986 $ 634 9.1 % Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 Net service revenue increased across all of our geographic segments, with Emerging Markets and Asia Pacific Markets reporting strong revenue growth. Technical support services revenue increased 12%, and advanced services, which relates to consulting support services for specific network needs, experienced 21% revenue growth. Technical support service revenue increased across all of our geographic segments with particular strength in Emerging Markets and Asia Pacific Markets. Growth in each of our United States and Canada and our European Markets segments also contributed to the overall technical support service revenue growth. Renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with recent product sales have resulted in a new installed base of equipment being serviced, which was the primary driver for these increases. We experienced revenue growth in advanced services across each of our geographic segments, with strong growth in our Asia Pacific Markets, European Markets, and Emerging Markets segments, followed by slower growth in our United States and Canada segment. Total service revenue growth also benefited from a full year of service revenue attributable to our acquisitions of Tandberg and Starent during fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 Net service revenue increased across all of our geographic segments in fiscal 2010, with particular strength in our Asia Pacific Markets. The increase in total service revenue was due to growth from technical support services as well as increased revenue from advanced services. Technical support service revenue increased across all of our geographic segments, with solid growth in our Asia Pacific Markets and European Markets segments. In fiscal 2010, we experienced advanced services revenue growth across each of our geographic segments except for our Emerging Markets segment. Total service revenue growth in fiscal 2010 also benefited from incremental revenue from our acquisitions during fiscal 2010 of Tandberg and Starent. Renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with product sales during fiscal 2010 have resulted in a new installed base of equipment being serviced, contributing to these increases. 56 Table of Contents Gross Margin The following table presents the gross margin for products and services (in millions, except percentages): AMOUNT PERCENTAGE Years Ended July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 July 25, 2009 July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 July 25, 2009 Gross margin: Product $ 20,879 $ 20,800 $ 18,650 60.5 % 64.2 % 64.0 % Service 5,657 4,843 4,444 65.1 % 63.6 % 63.6 % Total $ 26,536 $ 25,643 $ 23,094 61.4 % 64.0 % 63.9 % Product Gross Margin Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 The following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011: ProductGross MarginPercentage Fiscal 2010 64.2 % Sales discounts, rebates, and product pricing (2.9 )% Mix of products sold (1.6 )% Amortization of purchased intangible assets (0.6 )% Restructuring and other charges (0.4 )% Overall manufacturing costs 1.4 % Shipment volume, net of certain variable costs 0.4 % Fiscal 2011 60.5 % In fiscal 2011, product gross margin decreased by 3.7 percentage points. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of higher sales discounts, rebates, and unfavorable product pricing which were driven by normal market factors and by the geographic mix of product revenue. These factors impacted most of our customer markets and all of our geographic segments. Additionally, our product gross margin was negatively impacted by the shift in the mix of products sold as a result of revenue declines in our higher margin switching products coupled with revenue increases from our lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products. Higher year-over-year impairment charges related to acquisition-related intangible assets and higher restructuring and other charges, both primarily in the consumer business, also contributed to the decline in our product gross margin percentage. These negative factors were partially offset by lower overall manufacturing costs and by slightly higher shipment volume. The lower overall manufacturing costs were in part due to favorable component pricing, continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations, and value engineering. Value engineering is the process by which production costs are reduced through component redesign, board configuration, test processes, and transformation processes. Our future gross margins could be impacted by our product mix and by further growth in sales of products that have lower gross margins, such as Cisco Unified Computing System products. Our gross margins may also be impacted by the geographic mix of our revenue or, as was the case in fiscal 2011 and 2010, by increased sales discounts, rebates, and product pricing, which may be attributable to competitive factors. Additionally, our manufacturing-related costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain. If any of the preceding factors that impact our gross margins are adversely affected in future periods, our product and service gross margins could continue to decline. 57 Table of Contents Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 The following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010: ProductGross MarginPercentage Fiscal 2009 64.0 % Overall manufacturing costs 1.7 % Shipment volume, net of certain variable costs 0.6 % Mix of products sold 0.1 % Sales discounts, rebates, and product pricing (2.2 )% Fiscal 2010 64.2 % Product gross margin for fiscal 2010 increased by 0.2 percentage points compared with fiscal 2009, due primarily to lower overall manufacturing costs driven by strong operational efficiency in manufacturing operations, value engineering, and a reduction in other manufacturing-related costs. The product gross margin for fiscal 2010 also benefited from the increase in shipment volume. A favorable product mix contributed slightly to the increase in product gross margin percentage. Fiscal 2010 product gross margin was negatively impacted by sales discounts, rebates, and product pricing, which were driven by normal market factors, as well as the geographic mix of product revenue. The impact from sales discounts, rebates and product pricing was within our expected range. Service Gross Margin Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 Our service gross margin percentage increased by 1.5 percentage points for fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, with both technical support services and advanced services experiencing higher gross margins. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume. Partially offsetting the volume increases were unfavorable mix impacts, primarily due to advanced services representing a higher proportion of service revenue in fiscal 2011 and due to increased service delivery costs. Gross margin in technical support services increased primarily as a result of increased sales volume and lower headcount-related cost impacts. These benefits were partially offset by increased support service delivery costs, particularly from outside services. Advanced services gross margin increased primarily due to strong volume growth partially offset by higher delivery team costs, which were partially headcount related. Our revenue from advanced services may increase to a higher proportion of total service revenue due to our continued focus on providing comprehensive support to our customers’ networking devices, applications, and infrastructures. Our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and resources to support the overall service business. Other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services. Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 Our service gross margin percentage was unchanged from fiscal 2009 due to higher margins for technical support services offset by a decline in the gross margin for advanced services. The increase in technical support service gross margin in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 was primarily a result of increased volume. Technical support margins will experience some variability due to various factors such as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals as well as the timing of our strategic investments in headcount and resources to support this business. The decrease in advanced services gross margin in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 was primarily due to increased headcount costs, partially offset by higher volume. 58 Table of Contents Gross Margin by Segment The following table presents the total gross margin for each segment (in millions, except percentages): AMOUNT PERCENTAGE Years Ended July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 July 25, 2009 July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 July 25, 2009 Gross margin: United States and Canada $ 14,618 $ 14,042 $ 12,660 63.2 % 64.6 % 65.4 % European Markets 5,529 5,425 5,116 64.8 % 67.4 % 66.6 % Emerging Markets 3,067 2,805 2,438 61.8 % 64.2 % 61.0 % Asia Pacific Markets 4,147 3,847 3,272 62.8 % 65.4 % 64.3 % Segment total 27,361 26,119 23,486 63.3 % 65.2 % 65.0 % Unallocated corporate items (1) (825 ) (476 ) (392 ) Total $ 26,536 $ 25,643 $ 23,094 61.4 % 64.0 % 63.9 % (1) The unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, and other asset impairments and restructurings. We do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, the gross margin percentage across all geographic segments declined primarily due to higher sales discounts, rebates, and unfavorable pricing, as well as due to a product mix shift. These declines were partially offset by the impacts from increased shipment volume and lower overall manufacturing costs across all geographic segments. The gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment. Our product and service gross margins may be impacted by economic downturns or uncertain economic conditions as well as our movement into new market opportunities, and could decline if any of the factors that impact our gross margins are adversely affected in future periods. Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 In fiscal 2010, the gross margin percentage in the United States and Canada segment declined compared with fiscal 2009, primarily due to higher sales discounts and a lower service gross margin. The decline was partially offset by the impacts from increased shipment volume and lower overall manufacturing costs. The gross margin percentage in the European Markets segment increased during fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 due primarily to lower overall manufacturing costs, increased shipment volume and favorable product mix. The increase in this segment was partially offset by the impact of higher sales discounts. In fiscal 2010, the gross margin percentage in the Emerging Markets segment increased compared with fiscal 2009 due primarily to lower overall manufacturing costs, partially offset by the impact of higher sales discounts. The gross margin percentage in the Asia Pacific Markets segment increased during fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009, due primarily to higher shipment volume and lower overall manufacturing costs. Gross margin in the Asia Pacific Markets segment also benefited from favorable mix shifts in Japan. Partially offsetting this increase was the impact of higher sales discounts. For each of our segments, the negative impact of sales discounts, rebates and product pricing was driven by normal market factors and was within our expected range. Factors That May Impact Net Sales and Gross Margin Net product sales may continue to be affected by factors, including global economic downturns and related market uncertainty, that have resulted in reduced or cautious spending in our global enterprise, service provider, and commercial markets; changes in the geopolitical environment and global economic conditions; competition, 59 Table of Contents including price-focused competitors from Asia, especially from China; new product introductions; sales cycles and product implementation cycles; changes in the mix of our customers between service provider and enterprise markets; changes in the mix of direct sales and indirect sales; variations in sales channels; and final acceptance criteria of the product, system, or solution as specified by the customer. Sales to the service provider market have been and may be in the future characterized by large and sporadic purchases, especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain products within our New Products category. In addition, service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader range of services, including network design services; and often have acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition. Certain of our customers in the Emerging Markets segment also tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the net sales related to these transactions may similarly be affected by the timing of revenue recognition. As we focus on new market opportunities, customers may require greater levels of financing arrangements, service, and support, especially in the Emerging Markets segment, which in turn may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition. To improve customer satisfaction, we continue to focus on managing our manufacturing lead-time performance, which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog. A decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quarter-to-quarter net sales and operating results. Net product sales may also be adversely affected by fluctuations in demand for our products, especially with respect to telecommunications service providers and Internet businesses, whether or not driven by any slowdown in capital expenditures in the service provider market; price and product competition in the communications and information technology industry; introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products; adoption of new networking standards; and financial difficulties experienced by our customers. We may, from time to time, experience manufacturing issues that create a delay in our suppliers’ ability to provide specific components, resulting in delayed shipments. To the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in periods when we and our suppliers are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters are not remediated within the same quarter. For additional factors that may impact net product sales, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Our distributors and retail partners participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs. Increased sales to our distributors and retail partners generally result in greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and, to a certain degree, the timing of orders from our customers. We recognize revenue for sales to our distributors and retail partners generally based on a sell-through method using information provided by them, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for all cooperative marketing and other programs. Product gross margin may be adversely affected in the future by changes in the mix of products sold, including periods of increased growth of some of our lower margin products; introduction of new products, including products with price-performance advantages; our ability to reduce production costs; entry into new markets, including markets with different pricing structures and cost structures, as a result of internal development or through acquisitions; changes in distribution channels; price competition, including competitors from Asia, especially those from China; changes in geographic mix of our product sales; the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals; sales discounts; increases in material or labor costs, including share-based compensation expense; excess inventory and obsolescence charges; warranty costs; changes in shipment volume; loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing; effects of value engineering; inventory holding charges; and the extent to which we successfully execute on our strategy and operating plans. Additionally, our manufacturing-related costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain. Service gross margin may be impacted by various factors such as the change in mix between technical support services and advanced services; the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals; share-based compensation expense; and the timing of our strategic investments in headcount and resources to support this business. 60 Table of Contents Research and Development (R&D), Sales and Marketing, and General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses are summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Variancein Dollars Variancein Percent July 31, 2010 July 25, 2009 Variancein Dollars Variancein Percent Research and development $ 5,823 $ 5,273 $ 550 10.4 % $ 5,273 $ 5,208 $ 65 1.2 % Percentage of net sales 13.5 % 13.2 % 13.2 % 14.4 % Sales and marketing 9,812 8,782 1,030 11.7 % 8,782 8,444 338 4.0 % Percentage of net sales 22.7 % 21.9 % 21.9 % 23.4 % General and administrative 1,908 1,933 (25 ) (1.3 %) 1,933 1,524 409 26.8 % Percentage of net sales 4.4 % 4.8 % 4.8 % 4.2 % Total $ 17,543 $ 15,988 $ 1,555 9.7 % $ 15,988 $ 15,176 $ 812 5.4 % Percentage of net sales 40.6 % 39.9 % 39.9 % 42.0 % Fiscal 2010 had an extra week compared with fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2009. We estimate that the extra week contributed approximately $150 million of additional research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expense in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2012 we plan to reduce our annualized expense run rate by approximately $1 billion. The year-over-year changes within operating expenses, including the effects of foreign currency exchange rates, net of hedging, are summarized by line item as follows: R&D Expenses Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 The increase in R&D expenses for fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, was primarily due to higher headcount-related expenses, higher contracted services, and increased depreciation and equipment expenditures. The increase in depreciation expense was partially acquisition related. We continue to invest in R&D in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. If we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal R&D. Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 The slight increase in R&D expenses for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to higher headcount-related expenses, including increased variable compensation expense and the impact of acquisitions, higher share-based compensation expense, and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2010. Partially offsetting the increase in R&D expenses in fiscal 2010 were lower acquisition-related compensation expenses associated with milestone achievements from prior period acquisitions, and the absence in fiscal 2010 of the enhanced early retirement and limited workforce reduction charges incurred during fiscal 2009. Sales and Marketing Expenses Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 Sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2011 increased compared with fiscal 2010 due to an increase of $851 million in sales expenses and an increase of $179 million in marketing expenses. Both the sales expense and the marketing expense components of the category increased for fiscal 2011 due to higher headcount-related expenses, as well as higher outside services costs, higher depreciation expense, and increased share-based compensation expense. Additionally, marketing expenses for fiscal 2011 increased due to higher advertisement expenses. 61 Table of Contents Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 Sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 due to an increase of $222 million in sales expenses and an increase of $116 million in marketing expenses. Both the sales expense and the marketing expense components of the category increased during fiscal 2010 due to higher headcount-related expenses, including higher variable compensation expense, higher share-based compensation expense, and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2010. G&A Expenses Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 The decrease in G&A expenses in fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, was due to lower real estate-related charges in fiscal 2011 and the absence of non-income tax-related expenses (such as fees and licenses), which were included in fiscal 2010. Partially offsetting these items were higher headcount-related expenses, higher outside services costs for operational support areas, and increased equipment, depreciation, and rent expenses. Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 The increase in G&A expenses in fiscal 2010, compared with fiscal 2009 was in part attributable to approximately $130 million of higher real estate-related charges related to impairments and other charges related to excess facilities. Additionally, G&A expenses in fiscal 2010 increased due to higher share-based compensation expense, higher headcount-related expenses, acquisition-related expenses, and higher information technology expenses, as well as the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2010. Effect of Foreign Currency In fiscal 2011, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, increased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by $53 million, or approximately 0.3%, compared with fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2010, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, increased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by $34 million, or approximately 0.2%, compared with fiscal 2009. Headcount Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, our headcount increased by 1,111 employees, the increase being attributable to targeted hiring as part of our investment in growth initiatives, partially offset by the impacts of our voluntary early retirement program and our restructuring activities, which began to reduce our headcount in late fiscal 2011. We expect our headcount to decrease in the near term as part of targeted cost-cutting initiatives, which include the workforce reduction announced in July 2011. Additionally, we also expect our headcount in fiscal 2012 to decrease by approximately 5,000 employees upon the planned completion in fiscal 2012 of the sale of our Juarez, Mexico manufacturing operations. Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 For fiscal 2010, our headcount increased by approximately 5,150 employees, which was attributable to the acquisitions of Tandberg and Starent along with targeted hiring as part of our investment in growth initiatives. 62 Table of Contents Share-Based Compensation Expense The following table presents share-based compensation expense (in millions): Years Ended July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 July 25, 2009 Cost of sales—product $ 61 $ 57 $ 46 Cost of sales—service 177 164 128 Share-based compensation expense in cost of sales 238 221 174 Research and development 481 450 382 Sales and marketing 651 602 482 General and administrative 250 244 193 Share-based compensation expense in operating expenses 1,382 1,296 1,057 Total share-based compensation expense $ 1,620 $ 1,517 $ 1,231 The increase in share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2011 was due primarily to a change in vesting periods from five to four years for awards granted beginning in fiscal 2009, the timing of annual employee grants, and the overall growth in headcount and number of share-based awards granted on a year-over-year basis. Share-based compensation expense increased for fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 due primarily to the effects of straight-line vesting compared with accelerated vesting for options granted prior to fiscal 2006, a change in vesting periods from five to four years for awards granted beginning in fiscal 2009, and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2010. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets The following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses (in millions): Years Ended July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 July 25, 2009 Amortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses $ 520 $ 491 $ 533 For fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, the increase in the amortization of purchased intangible assets was due to impairment charges included in operating expenses of $92 million in fiscal 2011, partially offset by lower amortization due to certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized. The impairment charges were primarily due to declines in estimated fair value as a result of reductions in expected future cash flows associated with certain of our consumer products. For fiscal 2010, the decrease in the amortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses was primarily due to lower impairment charges in fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009, partially offset by increased amortization of purchased intangible assets from acquisitions completed during fiscal 2010. For additional information regarding purchased intangible assets, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. We consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets. 63 Table of Contents Restructuring and Other Charges In fiscal 2011, we incurred within operating expenses restructuring charges of $799 million. These charges included $453 million related to a voluntary early retirement program for eligible employees in the United States and Canada; $247 million related to employee severance for other employees subject to our reduction of our work force; and $71 million related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, primarily as a result of the pending sale of our Juarez, Mexico manufacturing operations. We also recorded charges within operating expenses of $28 million related to the consolidation of excess facilities and other activities. We announced in July 2011 that we expected to take up to $1.3 billion in pretax charges as part of our expense reduction actions. We incurred charges of $728 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 (included as part of the $799 million discussed above) related to these announcements. We expect the remaining charges to be incurred during fiscal 2012. Interest and Other Income, Net Interest Income (Expense), Net The following table summarizes interest income and interest expense (in millions): Years Ended July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Variancein Dollars July 31, 2010 July 25, 2009 Variancein Dollars Interest income $ 641 $ 635 $ 6 $ 635 $ 845 $ (210 ) Interest expense (628 ) (623 ) (5 ) (623 ) (346 ) (277 ) Interest income (expense), net $ 13 $ 12 $ 1 $ 12 $ 499 $ (487 ) Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 Interest income increased slightly in fiscal 2011 due to increased income from financing receivables offsetting the effect of lower average interest rates on our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and fixed income investments. The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, was due to higher average debt balances during fiscal 2011 attributable to our senior debt issuance in March 2011. Partially offsetting the impact of higher average debt balances during fiscal 2011 is the effect of lower average interest rates on our debt during fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 The decrease in interest income in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was due to lower average interest rates, partially offset by higher average total cash and cash equivalents and fixed income security balances in fiscal 2010. The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2010, compared with fiscal 2009, was primarily due to additional interest expense related to our senior debt issuances in November 2009 and February 2009. Other Income (Loss), Net The components of other income (loss), net, are summarized as follows (in millions): Years Ended July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Variancein Dollars July 31, 2010 July 25, 2009 Variancein Dollars Gains (losses) on investments, net: Publicly traded equity securities $ 88 $ 66 $ 22 $ 66 $ 86 $ (20 ) Fixed income securities 91 103 (12 ) 103 (110 ) 213 Total available-for-sale investments 179 169 10 169 (24 ) 193 Privately held companies 34 54 (20 ) 54 (56 ) 110 Net gains (losses) on investments 213 223 (10 ) 223 (80 ) 303 Other gains (losses), net (75 ) 16 (91 ) 16 (48 ) 64 Other income (loss), net $ 138 $ 239 $ (101 ) $ 239 $ (128 ) $ 367 64 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 The increase in total net gains on available-for-sale investments in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to higher gains on publicly traded equity securities, partially offset by lower gains on fixed income securities in fiscal 2011. These changes were the result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the unrealized gains and losses on investments. For fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010, the decline in net gains on investments in privately held companies was due to lower net equity method gains and lower gains on sales. The decline was partially offset by lower impairment charges on investments in privately held companies. Impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were $10 million and $25 million for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. The change in other gains and (losses), net for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to fiscal 2011 experiencing lower gains from customer lease terminations, higher donations expense, and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 For fiscal 2010, the increase in net gains on available-for-sale investments was due to the absence of impairment charges on these securities during fiscal 2010. For fiscal 2009, the net gains and losses on fixed income securities included impairment charges of $219 million and net gains on publicly traded equity securities included impairment charges of $39 million. The change in net gains (losses) on investments in privately held companies in fiscal 2010, compared with fiscal 2009, was primarily due to higher realized gains and lower impairment charges in fiscal 2010. Net losses on investments in privately held companies included impairment charges of $25 million in fiscal 2010 compared with $85 million in fiscal 2009. Other gains (losses), net for fiscal 2010 increased due primarily to gains resulting from customer operating lease terminations. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 17.1% for fiscal 2011, compared with 17.5% for fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the “Ninth Circuit”) withdrew its prior holding and reaffirmed the 2005 U.S. Tax Court ruling in Xilinx, Inc. v. Commissioner. The net 0.4 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was attributable to the absence in fiscal 2011 of this tax benefit of $158 million, or 1.7 percentage points, offset by other items including the tax benefit of $188 million, or 2.5 percentage points, related to the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. federal R&D credit. Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates. Our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries. If these earnings were distributed to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. 65 Table of Contents For a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fiscal 2010 Compared with Fiscal 2009 The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 17.5% for fiscal 2010, compared with an effective tax rate of 20.3% for fiscal 2009. As discussed above, during fiscal 2010 the Ninth Circuit withdrew its prior holding and reaffirmed the 2005 U.S. Tax Court ruling in Xilinx, Inc. v. Commissioner. This final decision effectively reversed the corresponding tax charge in fiscal 2009. The net 2.8 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was primarily attributable to this benefit and the absence in fiscal 2010 of the corresponding charge from fiscal 2009, partially offset by the absence in fiscal 2010 of the fiscal 2009 tax benefit of $106 million, or 1.4 percentage points, related to the retroactive portion of the U.S. federal R&D credit reinstatement. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, contractual obligations, other commitments, and the stock repurchase program on our liquidity and capital resources. Balance Sheet and Cash Flows Cash and Cash Equivalents and Investments The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments (in millions): July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Increase Cash and cash equivalents $ 7,662 $ 4,581 $ 3,081 Fixed income securities 35,562 34,029 1,533 Publicly traded equity securities 1,361 1,251 110 Total $ 44,585 $ 39,861 $ 4,724 The increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments was primarily the result of cash provided by operations of $10.1 billion, a slight decrease from $10.2 billion in fiscal 2010, and debt issuances of $1.5 billion, net of repayments. These increases were partially offset by the repurchase of common stock (net of the issuance of common stock related to employee stock incentive plans) of $5.1 billion, capital expenditures of $1.2 billion, and cash dividends paid of $0.7 billion. The slight decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 was primarily the result of a decrease in net income and the unfavorable impact to cash provided by operating activities from increased financing receivables, partially offset by the favorable impact to cash provided by operating activities from lower accounts receivable. Our total in cash and cash equivalents and investments held outside of the United States in various foreign subsidiaries was $39.8 billion and $33.2 billion as of July 30, 2011 and July 31, 2010, respectively. The remaining balance held in the United States as of July 30, 2011 and July 31, 2010 was $4.8 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively. Under current tax laws and regulations, if cash and cash equivalents and investments held outside the United States were to be distributed to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our fixed income investment 66 Table of Contents portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and dividends. We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue, excess tax benefits resulting from share-based compensation, and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. For additional discussion, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report. Accounts Receivable, Net The following table summarizes our accounts receivable, net (in millions), and DSO: July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Decrease Accounts receivable, net $ 4,698 $ 4,929 $ (231 ) DSO 38 41 (3 ) Our accounts receivable net, as of July 30, 2011 declined by approximately 5% compared with the end of fiscal 2010. Our DSO as of July 30, 2011 was lower by 3 days compared with the end of fiscal 2010. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, our cash collections were strong, and both product and services billings linearity improved, particularly with respect to the timing of product shipments. Services billings have traditionally had the effect of increasing DSO due in part to the timing of billings which in comparison to product billings, have a larger proportion billed in the latter part of the quarter. As services revenues have increased as a percentage of our total revenue, this has contributed to a higher DSO level in comparison to levels we experienced in past years. We believe that the current DSO level is in line with levels we expect in the near future. Inventories and Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers The following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in millions, except annualized inventory turns): July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Increase(Decrease) Inventories $ 1,486 $ 1,327 $ 159 Annualized inventory turns 11.8 12.6 (0.8 ) Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers $ 4,313 $ 4,319 $ (6 ) Inventories as of July 30, 2011 increased by 12% from our balance at the end of fiscal 2010, while for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers were flat. On a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by 3% from the balance at the end of fiscal 2010. We believe our inventory and purchase commitments are in line with our current demand forecasts. The inventory increase was due to higher levels of distributor inventory and higher deferred cost of sales. Our inventories have decreased from the levels we experienced in the first half of fiscal 2011. In the third quarter of fiscal 2011 we announced a restructuring of our consumer business, and as a result we lowered inventory levels for our consumer products. We also lowered inventory in certain parts of our cable set-top business. Our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods. Distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers. Manufactured finished goods consist primarily of build-to-order and 67 Table of Contents build-to-stock products. All inventories are accounted for at the lower of cost or market. Inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of our cost of sales. Our ending balance for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers reflects improvement and stabilization in lead times and the mitigation of many of the constraints at our component suppliers that we experienced in fiscal 2010. Due to the earthquake in Japan and resulting industry-wide component supply constraints, we made increased commitments to secure our near-term supply needs. Offsetting these increases in purchase commitments were actions we have taken related to the restructuring of our consumer business. While we may experience longer than normal lead times in the future, our lead times to customers improved on nearly all of our products during fiscal 2011 and as of the end of fiscal 2011 were within a normal range for nearly all of our products. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. We record a liability, included in other current liabilities, for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. The purchase commitments for inventory are expected to be primarily fulfilled within one year. Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels. Financing Receivables and Guarantees We measure our net balance sheet exposure position related to our financing receivables and financing guarantees by reducing the total of gross financing receivables and financing guarantees by the associated allowances for credit loss and deferred revenue. As of July 30, 2011, our net balance sheet exposure position related to financing receivables and financing guarantees was as follows (in millions): FINANCING RECEIVABLES FINANCINGGUARANTEES TOTAL July 30, 2011 LeaseReceivables LoanReceivables FinancedServiceContractsand Other Total ChannelPartner End-UserCustomers Total Gross amount less unearned income $ 2,861 $ 1,468 $ 2,637 $ 6,966 $ 336 $ 277 $ 613 $ 7,579 Allowance for credit loss (237 ) (103 ) (27 ) (367 ) — — — (367 ) Deferred revenue (120 ) (262 ) (2,044 ) (2,426 ) (248 ) (248 ) (496 ) (2,922 ) Net balance sheet exposure $ 2,504 $ 1,103 $ 566 $ 4,173 $ 88 $ 29 $ 117 $ 4,290 Financing Receivables Gross financing receivables less unearned income have increased by 33% compared with the end of fiscal 2010, driven by a 49% increase in gross financed service contracts, a 30% increase in gross lease receivables, and an 18% increase in gross loan receivables. We provide financing to certain end-user customers 68 Table of Contents and channel partners to enable sales of our products, services, and networking solutions. These financing arrangements include leases, financed service contracts, and loans. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases. We also provide certain qualified customers financing for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services. Our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term. Financing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are de-recognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. During fiscal 2011, the level of guarantees required by our financing partners decreased, resulting in lower deferred revenue associated with our financing guarantees. Deferred Revenue Related to Financing Receivables and Guarantees The majority of the deferred revenue in the preceding table is related to financed service contracts. The revenue related to financed service contracts, which primarily relates to technical support services, is deferred and included in deferred service revenue. The revenue related to financed service contracts is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed. A portion of the revenue related to lease and loan receivables is also deferred and included in deferred product revenue based on revenue recognition criteria. Borrowings Senior Notes The following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes (in millions): July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Increase(Decrease) Senior notes: Floating-rate notes, due 2014 $ 1,250 $ — $ 1,250 5.25% fixed-rate notes, due 2011 — 3,000 (3,000 ) 2.90% fixed-rate notes, due 2014 500 500 — 1.625% fixed-rate notes, due 2014 2,000 — 2,000 5.50% fixed-rate notes, due 2016 3,000 3,000 — 3.15% fixed-rate notes, due 2017 750 — 750 4.95% fixed-rate notes, due 2019 2,000 2,000 — 4.45% fixed-rate notes, due 2020 2,500 2,500 — 5.90% fixed-rate notes, due 2039 2,000 2,000 — 5.50% fixed-rate notes, due 2040 2,000 2,000 — Total $ 16,000 $ 15,000 $ 1,000 69 Table of Contents Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable quarterly on the floating rate notes. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of July 30, 2011. In March 2011, we issued $1.25 billion of senior floating interest rate notes due 2014, $2.0 billion of 1.625% fixed-rate senior notes due 2014, and $750 million of 3.15% fixed-rate senior notes due 2017, for an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion. To achieve our interest rate risk management objectives, we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $2.75 billion designated as fair value hedges of the senior fixed-rate notes included in the March 2011 debt issuance. In effect, these interest rate swaps convert the fixed interest rates of the fixed-rate senior notes to floating interest rates based on LIBOR. The gains and losses related to the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps substantially offset changes, attributable to market interest rates, in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt. In addition, in February 2011 we repaid $3.0 billion of fixed-rate senior notes upon their maturity. Commercial Paper In the third quarter of fiscal 2011 we established a short-term debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper notes. As of July 30, 2011, we had commercial paper notes of $500 million outstanding under this program. Other Notes and Borrowings Other notes and borrowings include notes and credit facilities with a number of financial institutions that are available to certain of our foreign subsidiaries. The amount of borrowings outstanding under these arrangements was $88 million and $59 million as of July 30, 2011 and July 31, 2010, respectively. Credit Facility We have a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on August 17, 2012. Any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the higher of the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50% or Bank of America’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time or (ii) LIBOR plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement. We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $1.9 billion and/or extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to August 15, 2014. As of July 30, 2011, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility. Deferred Revenue The following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue (in millions): July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Increase Service $ 8,521 $ 7,428 $ 1,093 Product 3,686 3,655 31 Total $ 12,207 $ 11,083 $ 1,124 Reported as: Current $ 8,025 $ 7,664 $ 361 Noncurrent 4,182 3,419 763 Total $ 12,207 $ 11,083 $ 1,124 The increase in deferred service revenue reflects the impact of new contract initiations and renewals, partially offset by the ongoing amortization of deferred service revenue. The increase in deferred product revenue was 70 Table of Contents primarily related to an increase in shipments not having met revenue recognition criteria as of July 30, 2011, partially offset by lower unrecognized revenue from two-tier distributors due to the timing of cash receipts from two-tier distributors. Contractual Obligations The impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. In addition, we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at July 30, 2011 (in millions): PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD July 30, 2011 Total Less than1 Year 1 to 3Years 3 to 5Years More than5 Years Operating leases $ 1,316 $ 374 $ 445 $ 220 $ 277 Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers 4,313 4,313 — — — Purchase obligations 2,473 1,443 779 233 18 Long-term debt 16,000 — 3,250 3,500 9,250 Other long-term liabilities 459 — 87 58 314 Total by period $ 24,561 $ 6,130 $ 4,561 $ 4,011 $ 9,859 Other long-term liabilities (uncertainty in the timing of future payments) 1,455 Total $ 26,016 Operating Leases We lease office space in several U.S. locations. Outside the United States, larger leased sites are located in Australia, Belgium, China, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Norway, and the United Kingdom. We also lease equipment and vehicles. Operating lease amounts include future minimum lease payments under all our noncancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year. Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. A significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in “Inventories and Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers.” As of July 30, 2011, the liability for these purchase commitments was $168 million and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. Long-Term Debt The amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, noncurrent deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $1.2 billion and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of $264 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) partially offset by payments. 71 Table of Contents Other Commitments In connection with our business combinations and asset purchases, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or continued employment with us of certain employees of acquired entities. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $192 million as of July 30, 2011, compared with $279 million as of July 31, 2010. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements. In the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers. These privately held companies and customers may be considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings and we have determined that as of July 30, 2011 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities. In fiscal 2010, Cisco and EMC Corporation (“EMC”), together with VMware, Inc. (“VMware”) formed the Virtual Computing Environment coalition and invested in Acadia Enterprises LLC (“Acadia”), a joint venture with EMC in which VMware and Intel also invested. During fiscal 2011, the Virtual Computing Environment coalition and Acadia were combined into a single entity and renamed the Virtual Computing Environment Company (“VCE”). As of July 30, 2011, our cumulative investment in the combined VCE entity was approximately $100 million and we owned approximately 35% of the outstanding equity. We account for our investment in VCE under the equity method, and accordingly our carrying value in VCE has been reduced by $79 million, which reflects our cumulative share of VCE’s losses primarily in fiscal 2011. Over the next 12 months, as VCE scales its operations, we expect that we will make additional investments in VCE and may incur additional losses, in proportion to our ownership percentage. On an ongoing basis, we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events. We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing Receivables and Guarantees.” Securities Lending We periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale investments. These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. The average balance of securities lending for fiscal 2011 and 2010 was $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against any collateral losses. As of July 30, 2011 and July 31, 2010, we had no 72 Table of Contents outstanding securities lending transactions. We believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements. We did not experience any losses in connection with the secured lending of securities during the periods presented. Stock Repurchase Program and Dividends In September 2001, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program. As of July 30, 2011, our Board of Directors had authorized an aggregate repurchase of up to $82 billion of common stock under this program, and the remaining authorized repurchase amount was $10.2 billion with no termination date. The stock repurchase activity under the stock repurchase program, reported based on the trade date is summarized as follows (in millions, except per-share amounts): SharesRepurchased Weighted-Average Priceper Share AmountRepurchased Cumulative balance at July 25, 2009 2,802 $ 20.41 $ 57,179 Repurchase of common stock under the stock repurchase program 325 24.02 7,803 Cumulative balance at July 31, 2010 3,127 $ 20.78 $ 64,982 Repurchase of common stock under the stock repurchase program 351 19.36 6,791 Cumulative balance at July 30, 2011 3,478 $ 20.64 $ 71,773 During fiscal 2011, cash dividends of $0.12 per share, or $658 million, were declared on our outstanding common stock and paid during the same period. Any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for capital resources. 73 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our financial position is exposed to a variety of risks, including interest rate risk, equity price risk, and foreign currency exchange risk. Interest Rate Risk Fixed Income Securities We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk. At any time, a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates, including the impact from lower credit spreads, could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives. We had no outstanding hedging instruments for our fixed income securities as of July 30, 2011. Our fixed income investments are held for purposes other than trading. Our fixed income investments are not leveraged as of July 30, 2011. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We monitor our interest rate and credit risks, including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers. As of July 30, 2011, approximately 75% of our fixed income securities balance consists of U.S. government and U.S. government agency securities. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong. The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our fixed income securities, including the hedging effects when applicable, as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates. The market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (“BPS”), plus 100 BPS, and plus 150 BPS. Due to the low interest rate environment at the end of each of fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, we did not believe a parallel shift of minus 100 BPS or minus 150 BPS was relevant. The hypothetical fair values as of July 30, 2011 and July 31, 2010 are as follows (in millions): VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTS FAIR VALUEAS OFJULY 30,2011 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Fixed income securities N/A N/A $ 35,740 $ 35,562 $ 35,384 $ 35,206 $ 35,029 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTS FAIR VALUEAS OFJULY 31,2010 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Fixed income securities N/A N/A $ 34,187 $ 34,029 $ 33,870 $ 33,712 $ 33,553 There were no impairment charges on our investments in fixed income securities for fiscal 2011 or 2010. For fiscal 2009 we had impairment charges of $219 million on investments in fixed income securities. Debt As of July 30, 2011, we had $16.0 billion in principal amount of senior notes outstanding, which consisted of $1.25 billion floating-rate notes and $14.75 billion fixed-rate notes. The carrying amount of the senior notes was $16.2 billion, and the related fair value was $17.4 billion, which fair value is based on market prices. As of July 30, 2011, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed-rate debt, excluding the $4.25 billion of hedged debt, by a decrease or increase of $0.5 billion, respectively. However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed-rate debt, which is not hedged. 74 Table of Contents Equity Price Risk The fair value of our equity investments in publicly traded companies is subject to market price volatility. We may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio. Our equity portfolio consists of securities with characteristics that most closely match the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index or NASDAQ Composite Index. These equity securities are held for purposes other than trading. To manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain equity securities, we may enter into equity derivatives designated as hedging instruments. Publicly Traded Equity Securities The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of publicly traded equity securities as a result of selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each equity security in the portfolio, excluding hedged equity securities, if any. Potential fluctuations in the price of each equity security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 20%, and 30% were selected based on potential near-term changes in those security prices.

For fiscal 2009 impairment charges on our investments in publicly traded equity securities were $39 million. Investments in Privately Held Companies We have also invested in privately held companies. These investments are recorded in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are accounted for using primarily either the cost or the equity method. As of July 30, 2011, the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was $796 million, compared with $756 million at July 31, 2010. Some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in , including, among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return. Our impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were $10 million, $25 million, and $85 million for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. 75 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign exchange forward and option contracts are summarized as follows (in millions): July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 NotionalAmount Fair Value NotionalAmount Fair Value Forward contracts: Purchased $ 3,722 $ 9 $ 3,368 $ 26 Sold $ 1,225 $ (10 ) $ 878 $ (7 ) Option contracts: Purchased $ 1,547 $ 63 $ 1,582 $ 56 Sold $ 1,577 $ (12 ) $ 1,507 $ (6 ) We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on sales has not been material because our sales are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our sales to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations. Approximately 70% of our operating expenses are U.S.-dollar denominated. Foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, increased our operating expenses by approximately 0.3% in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 and 0.2% in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. To reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by non-U.S.-dollar denominated operating expenses and costs, we hedge certain foreign currency forecasted transactions with currency options and forward contracts. These hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons. In designing a specific hedging approach, we consider several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of exposures, costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument, and potential effectiveness of the hedge. The gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales. We also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables, investments, and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities. The market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables, investments, and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances. Our forward and option contracts generally have the following maturities: Maturities Forward and option contracts—forecasted transactions related to operating expenses and service cost of sales Up to 18 months Forward contracts—current assets and liabilities Up to 3 months Forward contracts—net investments in foreign subsidiaries Up to 6 months Forward contracts—long-term customer financings Up to 2 years Forward contracts—investments Up to 2 years We do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for trading purposes. 76 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:09:27.202565

Total gross margin decreased by 0.2 percentage points primarily as a result of higher sales discounts and unfavorable product pricing as well as unfavorable product mix shifts. These negative impacts to gross margin were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs, higher volume, lower restructuring charges, and lower amortization and impairment charges from purchased intangible assets. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively declined by 2.7 percentage points due to the expense reductions we implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and in fiscal 2012. General and administrative expenses increased due primarily to impairment charges on real estate held for sale. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 4.1 percentage points, primarily as a result of our sales increase, lower restructuring charges, lower amortization of purchased intangible assets and operating expense management. Diluted earnings per share increased by 27% from the prior year, a result of both a 24% increase in net income and a decline in our diluted share count of 159 million shares. Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011—Business Summary Our solid fiscal 2012 performance reflects continued execution on our plan to deliver profitable growth. In a challenging global macroeconomic environment we grew profits faster than revenue as revenue increased by 7% while net income increased by 24%. Our net income increase was in part due to lower restructuring charges in the current fiscal year. In fiscal 2012, revenue increased by $2.8 billion. The Americas contributed $1.5 billion of the increase led by higher sales in the United States. APJC contributed $0.9 billion to the revenue increase led by strong sales growth in Japan. EMEA added $0.5 billion to the revenue increase in fiscal 2012. Both our product and service categories experienced revenue growth across each of our geographic segments. We encountered certain challenges from a geographic perspective, such as those we identified in fiscal 2012 related to macroeconomic challenges in much of Europe, which are expected to continue in fiscal 2013. Partially offsetting these challenges, we saw solid growth in fiscal 2012 in certain emerging countries such as Mexico and Brazil within the Americas, China within APJC, and Russia within EMEA. We believe our prospects in most emerging countries are strong and we plan to align more of our resources to meet expected further opportunities in these countries. From a customer markets standpoint, in fiscal 2012 we had solid revenue growth across the service provider, commercial, and enterprise markets. The public sector customer market experienced flat revenue growth in fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011. Global public sector spending was a challenge for us in fiscal 2012, particularly in the Americas, with lower U.S. federal government spending, and in parts of EMEA due to continued austerity measures taking place in parts of the region. We expect these challenges in the public sector to continue into fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2012, net product sales increased by $1.8 billion while service revenue increased by $1.0 billion. Data Center products provided $0.6 billion of the increase in net product sales, our core Switching and NGN Routing products collectively provided $0.6 billion, Service Provider Video provided $0.4 billion, and Wireless products contributed $0.3 billion of the increase. These are key product areas for us, which along with the Service revenue contribution reflect, in our view, the success we are experiencing with our technology architectures and our ability to deliver customer solutions, particularly in the enterprise and service provider data center and cloud environments. With regard to profitability, our profits grew faster than revenue during fiscal 2012. This was attributable to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue driven by the cost reduction efforts we began in fiscal 2011, and substantially completed in fiscal 2012, and lower restructuring charges in fiscal 2012, coupled with relative stability in our gross margin. Our product gross margin benefited from value engineering and other cost savings, such as savings generated from price negotiations with our component suppliers. In summary, we achieved solid and profitable growth in fiscal 2012, and did so while encountering a challenging global macroeconomic environment. We expect that we will continue to be impacted by some of the same 41 Table of Contents challenges in fiscal 2013. In particular, we expect to be impacted by continued weakness in the European economy, lower global public sector spending especially with regard to the U.S. federal government and European governments, and a continued conservative approach to IT-related capital spending as our customers respond to this difficult macroeconomic environment. Fourth Quarter Snapshot For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2011, net sales increased by 4%, with net product sales increasing by 3% and service revenue increasing by 12%. With regard to our geographic segment performance, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased by 7% in the Americas, decreased by 5% in EMEA, and increased by 9% in APJC. Total gross margin decreased by 0.7 percentage points, primarily as a result of higher sales discounts and unfavorable product pricing as well as unfavorable product mix shifts, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs and higher volume. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively declined by 1.6 percentage points. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, general and administrative expenses include $202 million of real estate charges, primarily related to impairment charges on real estate held for sale. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 7.3 percentage points, primarily as a result of lower restructuring and other charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and our sales increase. Diluted earnings per share increased by 64% from the prior year period, primarily as a result of a 56% increase in net income and also, to a lesser degree, from a decline of 142 million in our diluted share count. Strategy and Focus Areas We began in fiscal 2011, and had largely completed by the end of fiscal 2012, realigning our sales, services and engineering organizations in order to simplify our operating model, drive faster innovation, and focus on our five foundational priorities: • Leadership in our core business (routing, switching, and associated services) which includes comprehensive security and mobility solutions • Collaboration • Data center virtualization and cloud • Video • Architectures for business transformation We believe that focusing on these priorities best positions us to continue to expand our share of our customers’ information technology spending. For a full discussion of our strategy and focus areas, see Item 1. Business. Other Key Financial Measures The following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 (in millions, except days sales outstanding in accounts receivable (“DSO”) and annualized inventory turns): Fiscal2012 Fiscal2011 Cash and cash equivalents and investments $ 48,716 $ 44,585 Cash provided by operating activities $ 11,491 $ 10,079 Deferred revenue $ 12,880 $ 12,207 Repurchases of common stock--stock repurchase program $ 4,360 $ 6,791 Dividends $ 1,501 $ 658 DSO 34 days 38 days Inventories $ 1,663 $ 1,486 Annualized inventory turns 11.7 11.8 Our product backlog at the end of fiscal 2012 was $5.0 billion, or 11% of fiscal 2012 net sales, compared with $4.5 billion at the end of fiscal 2011, or 10% of fiscal 2011 net sales. 42 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met: • Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Contracts, Internet commerce agreements, and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement. • Delivery has occurred. Shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery. • The fee is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. • Collectibility is reasonably assured. We assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer’s payment history. In instances where final acceptance of the product, system, or solution is specified by the customer, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. When a sale involves multiple deliverables, such as sales of products that include services, the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting, and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price. Revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met. The amount of product and service revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and, if so, our valuation of the units of accounting for multiple deliverables. According to the accounting guidance prescribed in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 605, Revenue Recognition, we use vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (“VSOE”) for each of those units, when available. We determine VSOE based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the historical standalone transactions have the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range, generally evidenced by approximately 80% of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus 15% of the median rates. When VSOE does not exist, we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multiple-deliverable arrangements. Under the selling price hierarchy, third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”) will be considered if VSOE does not exist, and estimated selling price (“ESP”) will be used if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Generally, we are not able to determine TPE because our go-to-market strategy differs from that of others in our markets, and the extent of our proprietary technology varies among comparable products or services from those of our peers. In determining ESP, we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors, based on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement. We typically arrive at an ESP for a product or service that is not sold separately by considering company-specific factors such as geographies, competitive landscape, internal costs, profitability objectives, pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing, and existing portfolio pricing and discounting. Some of our sales arrangements have multiple deliverables containing software and related software support components. Such sales arrangements are subject to the accounting guidance in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition. 43 Table of Contents As our business and offerings evolve over time, our pricing practices may be required to be modified accordingly, which could result in changes in selling prices, including both VSOE and ESP, in subsequent periods. There were no material impacts during fiscal 2012, nor do we currently expect a material impact in fiscal 2013 on our revenue recognition due to any changes in our VSOE, TPE, or ESP. Revenue deferrals relate to the timing of revenue recognition for specific transactions based on financing arrangements, service, support, and other factors. Financing arrangements may include sales-type, direct-financing, and operating leases, loans, and guarantees of third-party financing. Our deferred revenue for products was $3.7 billion as of each July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011. Technical support services revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed, which typically is from one to three years. Advanced services revenue is recognized upon delivery or completion of performance. Our deferred revenue for services was $9.2 billion and $8.5 billion as of July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011, respectively. We make sales to distributors and retail partners which we refer to as two-tier systems of sales to the end customer. Revenue from distributors and retail partners is recognized based on a sell-through method using information provided by them. Our distributors and retail partners participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs. If actual credits received by our distributors and retail partners under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected. Allowances for Receivables and Sales Returns The allowances for receivables were as follows (in millions, except percentages): July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Allowance for doubtful accounts $ 207 $ 204 Percentage of gross accounts receivable 4.5 % 4.2 % Allowance for credit loss—lease receivables $ 247 $ 237 Percentage of gross lease receivables 7.2 % 7.6 % Allowance for credit loss—loan receivables $ 122 $ 103 Percentage of gross loan receivables 6.8 % 7.0 % The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience, credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay and expected default frequency rates, which are published by major third-party credit-rating agencies and are generally updated on a quarterly basis. We also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts. If a major customer’s creditworthiness deteriorates, if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, or if other circumstances arise, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, and additional allowances could be required, which could have an adverse impact on our revenue. The allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis. When evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis, we consider historical experience, credit quality and age of receivable balances, and economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. As discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2012 we refined our methodology for determining the portion of our allowance for credit loss that is evaluated on a collective basis. The refinement consists of more systematically giving effect to economic conditions, concentration of risk and correlation. We also began to use expected default frequency rates published by a major third-party credit-rating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default. Determination of expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk 44 Table of Contents ratings as well as assessing economic conditions, concentration of risk, and correlation are complex and subjective. Our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future, which could adversely affect our revenue. Both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible. A reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. The reserve for future sales returns as of July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011 was $129 million and $106 million, respectively, and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable. If the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established, our revenue could be adversely affected. Inventory Valuation and Liability for Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers Our inventory balance was $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion as of July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011, respectively. Inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of our cost of sales. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. As of July 28, 2012, the liability for these purchase commitments was $193 million, compared with $168 million as of July 30, 2011, and was included in other current liabilities. Our provision for inventory was $115 million, $196 million, and $94 million for fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was $151 million, $114 million, and $8 million in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. On a combined basis, the $44 million decline in our provisions for inventory and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the absence in the current fiscal year of charges we recorded in connection with the restructuring and realignment of our consumer business during fiscal 2011. If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we could be required to increase our inventory write-downs, and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and accordingly our profitability could be adversely affected. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments. Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence, particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainties and conditions and the resulting potential for changes in future demand forecast. Warranty Costs The liability for product warranties, included in other current liabilities, was $415 million as of July 28, 2012, compared with $342 million as of July 30, 2011. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years, and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty. We accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs, technical support labor costs, and associated overhead. Material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment. Technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period. Overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities. 45 Table of Contents The provision for product warranties issued during fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010 was $661 million, $456 million, and $469 million, respectively. The increase in the provision in fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, was primarily due to increased shipment volume of products with higher warranty costs and longer warranty lives, and also due to increased warranty charges related to specific products. If we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected, our profitability could be adversely affected. Share-Based Compensation Expense Share-based compensation expense is presented as follows (in millions): Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Share-based compensation expense $ 1,401 $ 1,620 $ 1,517 Prior to the initial declaration of a quarterly cash dividend on March 17, 2011, the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units was measured based on an expected dividend yield of 0% as we did not historically pay cash dividends on our common stock. For awards granted on or subsequent to March 17, 2011, we used an annualized dividend yield based on the per share dividends declared by our Board of Directors as of the grant date. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The determination of the fair value of employee stock options and employee stock purchase rights on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. For employee stock options and employee stock purchase rights, these variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends as of the grant date. For employee stock options, we have historically used the implied volatility for two-year traded options on our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the lattice-binomial model. For employee stock purchase rights, we used the implied volatility for traded options (with lives corresponding to the expected life of the employee stock purchase rights) on our stock. The selection of the implied volatility approach was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. The valuation of employee stock options is also impacted by kurtosis and skewness, which are technical measures of the distribution of stock price returns and the actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. Because share-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for forfeitures. If factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of our option-pricing model in future periods or if we experience different forfeiture rates, the compensation expense that is derived may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current year. Fair Value Measurements Our fixed income and publicly traded equity securities, collectively, are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at a fair value of $38.9 billion as of July 28, 2012, compared with $36.9 billion as of July 30, 2011. Our fixed income investment portfolio, as of July 28, 2012, consisted primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As described more fully in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a valuation hierarchy is based on the level of independent, objective evidence available regarding the value of the investments. It encompasses three classes of investments: Level 1 consists of securities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical securities; Level 2 consists of securities for which observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs are used, such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets and model-derived valuations for which the variables are derived from, or corroborated by, observable market data; and Level 3 consists of securities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value. 46 Table of Contents Our Level 2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. We use inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from independent pricing vendors, quoted market prices, or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities. We use such pricing data as the primary input, to which we have not made any material adjustments during fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio. We are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates. The inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness, may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information, and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to its estimate of fair value. The assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective. However, given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio, and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets, we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of subjectivity and judgment was material to the valuation of the investment portfolio as of July 28, 2012. We had no Level 3 investments in our total portfolio as of July 28, 2012. Other-than-Temporary Impairments We recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary. The ultimate value realized on these securities, to the extent unhedged, is subject to market price volatility until they are sold. If the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary. An impairment is considered other than temporary if (i) we have the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on (i) or (ii) described in the prior sentence, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (iii), the amount representing credit loss, defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security, will be recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). In estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected, we consider all available information, including past events, current conditions, the remaining payment terms of the security, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults, and the value of underlying collateral. For publicly traded equity securities, we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Impairment charges on our investments in publicly traded equity securities were not material in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010. There were no impairment charges on investments in fixed income securities in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. We also have investments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages. As of July 28, 2012, our investments in privately held companies were $858 million, compared with $796 million as of July 30, 2011, and were included in other assets. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment and will make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required, based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies. These investments are inherently risky 47 Table of Contents because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. Our impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were $23 million, $10 million, and $25 million in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Asset Impairments Our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets. The goodwill recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011 was $17.0 billion and $16.8 billion, respectively. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill resulting from our annual impairment testing in fiscal 2012, 2011 or 2010. For the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2012, the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was $17.3 billion for the Americas segment, $13.8 billion for the EMEA segment and $9.1 billion for the APJC segment. We performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit as of July 28, 2012 would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. As a result of the divestiture of our manufacturing operations in Juarez, Mexico, in fiscal 2011 we recorded an adjustment of $63 million to reduce goodwill associated with these operations. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were $12 million, $164 million, and $28 million during fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, research and development (“R&D”) tax credits, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, international realignments, and transfer pricing adjustments. Our effective tax rate was 20.8%, 17.1%, and 17.5% in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax 48 Table of Contents outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by expiration of or lapses in the R&D tax credit laws; by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany R&D cost-sharing arrangement and legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible U.S. changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. Loss Contingencies We are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 49 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010 were 52, 52, and 53-week fiscal years, respectively.

Our net sales, which include product and service revenue, for each segment are summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Variancein Dollars Variancein Percent July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Variancein Dollars Variancein Percent Net sales: Americas $ 26,501 $ 25,015 $ 1,486 5.9 % $ 25,015 $ 23,334 $ 1,681 7.2 % Percentage of net sales 57.5 % 57.9 % 57.9 % 58.3 % EMEA 12,075 11,604 471 4.1 % 11,604 10,825 779 7.2 % Percentage of net sales 26.2 % 26.8 % 26.8 % 27.0 % APJC 7,485 6,599 886 13.4 % 6,599 5,881 718 12.2 % Percentage of net sales 16.3 % 15.3 % 15.3 % 14.7 % Total $ 46,061 $ 43,218 $ 2,843 6.6 % $ 43,218 $ 40,040 $ 3,178 7.9 % Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, net sales increased by 7%. Within total net sales growth, net product sales increased by 5%, while service revenue increased by 12%. Our product and service revenue totals reflect sales growth across each of our geographic segments. The sales increase was primarily due to: the strong performance of our Service offerings; new product transitions taking place in Switching; and increased demand for our Data Center, Service Provider Video, and Wireless products. We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on sales has not been material because our sales are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our sales to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations. In addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced IT spending environment and budget-driven reductions in spending by government entities, net sales by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple-element arrangements; the mix of financing arrangements provided to our channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the net sales related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the net sales of the relevant segment. As has been the case in certain of our emerging countries from time to time, customers require greater levels of financing arrangements, service, and support and this may occur in future periods, which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue. 50 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, net sales increased by 8%. Within total net sales growth, net product sales increased by 6%, while service revenue increased by 14%. Our product and service revenue totals each reflected sales growth across each of our geographic segments. The sales increase was due to customer acceptance of the new product transitions taking place in our core switching and routing businesses, sales growth in our Collaboration, Data Center, Wireless, and Service Provider Video product categories and the strong performance of our services solutions. Net Product Sales by Segment The following table presents the breakdown of net product sales by segment (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Variancein Dollars Variancein Percent July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Variancein Dollars Variancein Percent Net product sales: Americas $ 20,168 $ 19,292 $ 876 4.5 % $ 19,292 $ 18,240 $ 1,052 5.8 % Percentage of net product sales 55.5 % 55.9 % 55.9 % 56.3 % EMEA 10,024 9,788 236 2.4 % 9,788 9,223 565 6.1 % Percentage of net product sales 27.6 % 28.3 % 28.3 % 28.4 % APJC 6,134 5,446 688 12.6 % 5,446 4,957 489 9.9 % Percentage of net product sales 16.9 % 15.8 % 15.8 % 15.3 % Total $ 36,326 $ 34,526 $ 1,800 5.2 % $ 34,526 $ 32,420 $ 2,106 6.5 % Americas Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, net product sales in the Americas segment increased by 5%. The increase in net product sales was across most of our customer markets in the Americas segment, led by growth in the enterprise, service provider and commercial markets. We experienced a net product sales decline in the public sector market for the fiscal year. Within the Americas segment, net product sales to the U.S. public sector were flat, as lower net product sales to the U.S. federal government were offset by higher net product sales to state and local government. From a country perspective, net product sales increased by 4% in the United States, 10% in Canada, 21% in Mexico, and 14% in Brazil. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, net product sales in the Americas segment increased by 6%. Net product sales increased 3% in the United States, 31% in Canada, 20% in Brazil, and 8% in Mexico. The increase in net product sales was across all of our customer markets in the Americas segment, led by the net product sales growth in our commercial market, followed by smaller increases in net product sales growth in the service provider, enterprise, and public sector markets. Net product sales to the U.S. public sector decreased due to a decrease in sales to the U.S. federal government, while sales to the state and local government market were flat. EMEA Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, net product sales in the EMEA segment increased by 2%. The increase in net product sales was across most of our customer markets in the EMEA segment, led by growth in the commercial, enterprise and public sector markets. We experienced a slight decline in net product sales in the service provider customer market during the fiscal year driven by lower revenue from this customer market in several of the large countries in the region. From a country perspective, net product sales increased by 11% in the United Kingdom, 15% in Russia, and 9% in the Netherlands. These increases were partially offset by net product sales declines of 23% in Italy, 21% in Spain, 2% in Germany, and 1% in France. 51 Table of Contents We believe that the slower growth we experienced in EMEA was a result of weak macroeconomic conditions attributable in large part to the austerity measures taking place in parts of the region. In particular, we experienced weakness in this segment during the second half of fiscal 2012, with a year-over-year decline in net product sales in this segment during the fourth quarter. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, net product sales in the EMEA segment increased by 6%. The increase in net product sales in the European Markets segment was primarily due to growth in the enterprise and service provider markets and to a lesser extent sales growth in the commercial market. For fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, sales to the public sector market were flat. From a country perspective, for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010, net product sales increased by approximately 17% in France, 13% in the Netherlands, 2% in Germany, 1% in the United Kingdom, and 63% in Russia and were flat in Italy. APJC Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, net product sales in the APJC segment increased by 13%. The increase was led by strong net product sales growth in the service provider market, and to a lesser degree, in the commercial, enterprise and public sector markets. From a country perspective, net product sales increased by 27% in Japan, 17% in China, and 12% in Australia. We experienced a year-over-year net product sales decline of 19% in South Korea, and 4% in India. Our sales decline in India was due to ongoing business momentum challenges in the public sector customer market. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, net product sales in our APJC segment increased by 10%. The increase was led by sales growth in the enterprise, commercial and service provider markets, and to a lesser extent sales growth in the public sector market. From a country perspective, net product sales increased by approximately 13% in India, 11% in China, 8% in Australia, and 7% in Japan. Net Product Sales by Groups of Similar Products In addition to the primary view on a geographic basis, we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes. Our product categories consist of the following categories (with subcategories in parentheses): Switching (fixed switching, modular switching, and storage); NGN Routing (high-end routers, mid-range and low-end routers, and optical); Collaboration (unified communications and Cisco TelePresence); Service Provider Video (cable and cable modem, video systems); Wireless; Security; Data Center; and Other Products. The Other Products category consists primarily of Linksys-related products, emerging technology products, and other networking products. 52 Table of Contents The following table presents net sales for groups of similar products (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Variancein Dollars Variancein Percent July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Variancein Dollars Variancein Percent Net product sales: Switching $ 14,531 $ 14,130 $ 401 2.8 % $ 14,130 $ 14,074 $ 56 0.4 % Percentage of net product sales 40.0 % 40.9 % 40.9 % 43.4 % NGN Routing 8,425 8,264 161 1.9 % 8,264 7,868 396 5.0 % Percentage of net product sales 23.2 % 24.0 % 24.0 % 24.3 % Collaboration 4,139 4,013 126 3.1 % 4,013 2,981 1,032 34.6 % Percentage of net product sales 11.4 % 11.6 % 11.6 % 9.2 % Service Provider Video 3,858 3,483 375 10.8 % 3,483 3,294 189 5.7 % Percentage of net product sales 10.6 % 10.1 % 10.1 % 10.2 % Wireless 1,699 1,427 272 19.1 % 1,427 1,134 293 25.8 % Percentage of net product sales 4.7 % 4.1 % 4.1 % 3.5 % Security 1,349 1,200 149 12.4 % 1,200 1,302 (102 ) (7.8 )% Percentage of net product sales 3.7 % 3.5 % 3.5 % 4.0 % Data Center 1,298 694 604 87.0 % 694 196 498 254.1 % Percentage of net product sales 3.6 % 2.0 % 2.0 % 0.6 % Other 1,027 1,315 (288 ) (21.9 )% 1,315 1,571 (256 ) (16.3 )% Percentage of net product sales 2.8 % 3.8 % 3.8 % 4.8 % Total $ 36,326 $ 34,526 $ 1,800 5.2 % $ 34,526 $ 32,420 $ 2,106 6.5 % Switching Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, net product sales in our Switching product category increased by 3% or $401 million. The increase was primarily due to growth from transitioning products taking place in our Switching product portfolio. The impact of competitive pressures moderated growth, primarily in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2012. Within our Switching product category, higher sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches and storage products were partially offset by lower sales of modular switches. Sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches increased by 11%, or $814 million, while sales of modular switches decreased by 8%, or approximately $469 million. The increase in sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches was primarily due to increased sales of Cisco Catalyst 2960 Series Switches, Cisco Nexus 2000 and 5000 Series Switches, and the Cisco Catalyst 3750 Series Switches, partially offset by decreased sales of Cisco Catalyst 3560 Series Switches. Net product sales in our Switching product category were positively impacted by a 11% increase in sales of storage products, primarily stemming from strong growth in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2012. Sales of modular switches decreased primarily due to lower sales of Cisco Catalyst 6500 and 4500 Series Switches, partially offset by increased sales of Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 Net product sales in our Switching product category were relatively flat in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010, which was due to the combined effect of continuing transitions taking place in our product portfolio, lower public sector spending, and the impact of increased competitive pressures. Within our Switches product category, higher sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches partially offset lower sales of modular switches. Sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches increased 5%, or $331 million, while sales of modular switches decreased 5%, or $306 million. The increase in LAN fixed-configuration switches was primarily due to increased sales of Cisco Catalyst 2960 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 2000 and 5000 Series Switches, partially offset by decreased sales of Cisco Catalyst 3560 and 3750 Series Switches. The decrease in sales of modular switches was primarily due to decreased sales of Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches, partially offset by increased sales of Cisco Nexus 7000 and Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series Switches. Net product sales increased 6%, or $31 million, in Storage, which was attributable to increased sales of our Cisco MDS 9000 product line. 53 Table of Contents NGN Routing Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, net product sales in our NGN Routing product category increased by 2%, or $161 million. The increase in sales of our NGN Routing product category was driven by a 6%, or $293 million, increase in sales of high-end router products, partially offset by a 3%, or $83 million, decline in sales of our midrange and low-end router products. Within the high-end router products category, the increase was driven by higher sales of Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System products and higher sales of the Cisco Aggregation Services Routers (“ASR”) 9000, 5000, and 1000 family of products. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of Cisco 7600 and 12000 Series Routers. Within the midrange and low-end router products category, the decrease was related to the product transition taking place within our Cisco Integrated Services Router (ISR) products, as the sales decline in our older generation products had a greater impact than the growth experienced with our Cisco ISR 1900, ISR 2900 and ISR 3900 router products in this category. Sales of other NGN Routing products decreased by 6%, compared with fiscal 2011, primarily due to decreased sales of other routing and optical networking products. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010, growth in sales of our NGN Routing product category was driven by a 7%, or $294 million, increase in sales of our high-end routers. Within high-end router products, the increase was driven by higher sales of Cisco ASR 5000 products from our December 2009 acquisition of Starent and higher sales of the Cisco ASR 1000 and 9000 products. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of Cisco 12000 and 7600 Series Routers. For fiscal 2011, midrange and low-end routers sales decreased sales by 3%, or $84 million compared with fiscal 2010. Sales of other NGN Routing products increased by 31%, compared with fiscal 2011, primarily due to increased sales of optical networking products. Collaboration Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, sales of Collaboration products increased by 3%, or $126 million. The increase was due to a 5% increase in sales of unified communications products, primarily IP phones and collaborative web-based offerings, partially offset by a 1% decrease in sales of Cisco TelePresence systems. Challenges in both the public sector and demand weakness in Europe, along with our execution challenges related to our sales coverage model, contributed to the decrease in sales of Cisco TelePresence systems in fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 Sales of Collaboration products increased by 35%, or $1.0 billion, primarily due to the inclusion of Tandberg sales within our Cisco TelePresence systems product line following our fiscal 2010 third quarter acquisition of Tandberg, and a 6% increase in sales of unified communications products, primarily IP phones and collaborative web-based offerings. Service Provider Video Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, sales of Service Provider Video products increased by 11%, or $375 million due to growth in our service provider customer market from increased sales of set-top boxes worldwide. Sales of video systems and other products increased by 13%, or $316 million, while sales of cable and cable modem products increased by 6%, or $59 million. 54 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 Sales of Service Provider Video products increased by 6%, or $189 million, due to increased sales of cable and cable modem products of 20% due to strong customer market demand, and increased sales of video systems products of 1%. Wireless Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, sales of Wireless products increased by 19%, or $272 million. These increases reflect the continued customer adoption of and migration to the Cisco Unified Wireless Network architecture and new product performance. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 Sales of Wireless products increased by 26%, or $293 million, which was primarily due to continued customer adoption of and migration to the Cisco Unified Wireless Network architecture. Security Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, sales of Security products increased by 12%, or $149 million. These increases were primarily due to growth in our network security products driven by the recent update of our firewall security product portfolio. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, sales of Security products decreased by 8%, or $102 million. Our decreased sales of Security products were the result of lower sales of module and line cards related to our routers and LAN switches, partially offset by increased sales of our web and email security products. Data Center Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, sales of Data Center products increased by 87%, or $604 million, due to increased sales of Cisco Unified Computing System products. The increase was due to the momentum we are experiencing with our products for the enterprise and service provider data center and cloud environments, as current customers increase their data center build out, and new customer product purchases. To the extent our data center business grows and further penetrates the market, we expect that, in comparison to what we experienced during the initial rapid growth of this business, the growth rates for our data center product sales will experience more normal seasonality consistent with the overall server market. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 Sales of Data Center products increased by 254%, or $498 million, due to sales growth of over 273%, or $496 million, of Cisco Unified Computing System products. Other Products The decrease in sales of Other Products for fiscal 2012 and 2011 as compared with the prior fiscal year compare periods was primarily due to lower sales of Flip Video camera products in connection with our decision in fiscal 2011 to exit this consumer product line. 55 Table of Contents Net Service Sales by Segment The following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Variancein Dollars Variancein Percent July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Variancein Dollars Variancein Percent Net service sales: Americas $ 6,333 $ 5,723 $ 610 10.7 % $ 5,723 $ 5,094 $ 629 12.3 % Percentage of net service sales 65.0 % 65.8 % 65.8 % 66.9 % EMEA 2,051 1,816 235 12.9 % 1,816 1,602 214 13.4 % Percentage of net service sales 21.1 % 20.9 % 20.9 % 21.0 % APJC 1,351 1,153 198 17.2 % 1,153 924 229 24.8 % Percentage of net service sales 13.9 % 13.3 % 13.3 % 12.1 % Total $ 9,735 $ 8,692 $ 1,043 12.0 % $ 8,692 $ 7,620 $ 1,072 14.1 % Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, service revenue experienced double-digit percentage growth across all of our geographic segments. Worldwide technical support services revenue increased by 10%, and worldwide advanced services, which relates to consulting support services for specific network needs, experienced 20% revenue growth. Technical support services revenue grew across all of our geographic segments, with strong revenue growth in our EMEA and APJC segments. Renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with recent product sales have resulted in a new installed base of equipment being serviced, which was the primary driver for these increases. Advanced services revenue also grew across all geographic segments, with particularly strong growth in APJC. The APJC revenue growth in advanced services was led by strength in the second half of fiscal 2012 and was driven by both subscription growth and transaction growth, which was in part the result of the completion of several large, multiyear projects in this region. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 Net service revenue increased across all of our geographic segments, with APJC reporting strong revenue growth. Technical support services revenue increased 12%, and advanced services experienced 21% revenue growth. Technical support service revenue increased across all of our geographic segments, with particular strength in APJC. Growth in each of our Americas and EMEA segments also contributed to the overall technical support service revenue growth. We experienced revenue growth in advanced services across each of our geographic segments, with strong growth in our APJC and EMEA segments, followed by growth in our Americas segment. Total service revenue growth also benefited from a full year of service revenue attributable to our acquisitions of Tandberg and Starent during fiscal 2010. Gross Margin The following table presents the gross margin for products and services (in millions, except percentages): AMOUNT PERCENTAGE Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Gross margin: Product $ 21,821 $ 20,879 $ 20,800 60.1 % 60.5 % 64.2 % Service 6,388 5,657 4,843 65.6 % 65.1 % 63.6 % Total $ 28,209 $ 26,536 $ 25,643 61.2 % 61.4 % 64.0 % 56 Table of Contents Product Gross Margin Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 The following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012: ProductGross MarginPercentage Fiscal 2011 60.5 % Sales discounts, rebates, and product pricing (2.8 )% Mix of products sold (0.6 )% Overall manufacturing costs 1.7 % Restructuring and other charges 0.5 % Shipment volume, net of certain variable costs 0.5 % Amortization of purchased intangible assets 0.3 % Fiscal 2012 60.1 % In fiscal 2012, product gross margin decreased by 0.4 percentage points compared with fiscal 2011. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of higher sales discounts, rebates, and unfavorable product pricing, which were driven by normal market factors and by the geographic mix of net product sales. These factors impacted most of our customer markets and all of our geographic segments. Additionally, our product gross margin for fiscal 2012 was negatively impacted by the shift in the mix of products sold, primarily as a result of sales increases in our relatively lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products and increased sales in other lower margin products. In fiscal 2012, we experienced a positive mix impact from the absence of the lower margin consumer related products due to our exit from the Flip Video camera product line in fiscal 2011. The negative impacts to product gross margin were partially offset by lower overall manufacturing costs, higher shipment volume, lower restructuring charges, the absence of significant impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets, and lower amortization expense in fiscal 2012. The lower overall manufacturing costs were in part due to increased benefits from our value engineering efforts, particularly in certain of our Switching products; favorable component pricing; and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations. Value engineering is the process by which production costs are reduced through component redesign, board configuration, test processes, and transformation processes. Our future gross margins could be impacted by our product mix and by further growth in sales of products that have lower gross margins, such as Cisco Unified Computing System products. Our gross margins may also be impacted by the geographic mix of our revenue or, as was the case in fiscal 2012 and 2011, by increased sales discounts, rebates, and product pricing, which may be attributable to competitive factors. Additionally, our manufacturing-related costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain. If any of the preceding factors that impact our gross margins are adversely affected in future periods, our product and service gross margins could continue to decline. 57 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 The following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011: ProductGross MarginPercentage Fiscal 2010 64.2 % Sales discounts, rebates, and product pricing (2.9 )% Mix of products sold (1.6 )% Amortization of purchased intangible assets (0.6 )% Restructuring and other charges (0.4 )% Overall manufacturing costs 1.4 % Shipment volume, net of certain variable costs 0.4 % Fiscal 2011 60.5 % In fiscal 2011, product gross margin decreased by 3.7 percentage points. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of higher sales discounts, rebates, and unfavorable product pricing, which were driven by normal market factors and by the geographic mix of product revenue. These factors impacted most of our customer markets and all of our geographic segments. Additionally, our product gross margin was negatively impacted by the shift in the mix of products sold as a result of revenue declines in our higher margin switching products coupled with revenue increases from our lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products. Higher year-over-year impairment charges related to acquisition-related intangible assets and higher restructuring and other charges, both primarily in the consumer business, also contributed to the decline in our product gross margin percentage. These negative factors were partially offset by lower overall manufacturing costs and by slightly higher shipment volume. The lower overall manufacturing costs were in part due to favorable component pricing, continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations, and value engineering. Service Gross Margin Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 Our service gross margin percentage increased by 0.5 percentage points for fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume for both technical support services and advanced services. The benefit to gross margin of increased volume was partially offset by increased headcount-related and partner delivery costs, and unfavorable mix. The mix impacts were due to our lower gross margin advanced services revenue contributing a higher proportion of service revenue for fiscal 2012, as compared with the prior year. Lower share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 also added to the increase in service gross margin. For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, gross margin from technical support services was flat as the benefits from a 10% increase in revenue combined with lower supply chain costs were offset by higher headcount-related costs. For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, gross margin in advanced services increased primarily due to a 20% increase in revenue in fiscal 2012. Partially offsetting the volume benefit were higher delivery team costs which were, in part headcount related, and higher partner delivery costs. Our revenue from advanced services may increase to a higher proportion of total service revenue due to our continued focus on providing comprehensive support to our customers’ networking devices, applications, and infrastructures. Our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. Other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services. 58 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 Our service gross margin percentage increased by 1.5 percentage points for fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, with both technical support services and advanced services experiencing higher gross margins. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume. Partially offsetting the volume increases were unfavorable mix impacts, primarily due to advanced services representing a higher proportion of service revenue in fiscal 2011 and due to increased service delivery costs. Gross margin in technical support services increased primarily as a result of increased sales volume and lower headcount-related cost impacts. These benefits were partially offset by increased support service delivery costs, particularly from outside services. Advanced services gross margin increased primarily due to strong volume growth partially offset by higher delivery team costs, which were partially headcount related. Gross Margin by Segment The following table presents the total gross margin for each segment (in millions, except percentages): AMOUNT PERCENTAGE Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Gross margin: Americas $ 16,639 $ 15,766 $ 15,042 62.8 % 63.0 % 64.5 % EMEA 7,605 7,452 7,235 63.0 % 64.2 % 66.8 % APJC 4,519 4,143 3,842 60.4 % 62.8 % 65.3 % Segment total 28,763 27,361 26,119 62.4 % 63.3 % 65.2 % Unallocated corporate items (1) (554 ) (825 ) (476 ) Total $ 28,209 $ 26,536 $ 25,643 61.2 % 61.4 % 64.0 % (1) The unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, and other asset impairments and restructuring. We do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments. The decrease in fiscal 2012 amounts is primarily due to the absence in fiscal 2012 of significant restructuring and acquisition-related intangible asset impairments that were recognized in fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, we experienced a gross margin percentage decline across all of our geographic segments as compared with fiscal 2011. The Americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage decline with the impact of higher sales discounts, rebates and unfavorable pricing being substantially offset by higher volume, higher service gross margin, lower overall manufacturing and delivery costs, and favorable mix impacts. Significantly lower sales to the consumer market resulted in a positive gross margin mix impact to the Americas segment for fiscal 2012. The gross margin percentage decline in our EMEA segment was primarily the result of unfavorable mix impacts; higher sales discounts, rebates and unfavorable pricing; and lower service gross margin due to increased headcount-related costs. These decreases were partially offset by lower overall manufacturing and delivery costs and increased volume in this segment. The APJC segment experienced the largest gross margin percentage decline of all of our geographic segments due primarily to the impact of higher sales discounts, rebates and unfavorable pricing, lower service gross margin, and unfavorable mix impacts. These decreases were partially offset by increased volume and lower overall manufacturing and delivery costs. 59 Table of Contents The gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment. Our product and service gross margins may be impacted by economic downturns or uncertain economic conditions as well as our movement into new market opportunities, and could decline if any of the factors that impact our gross margins are adversely affected in future periods. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, the gross margin percentage across all geographic segments declined primarily due to higher sales discounts, rebates, and unfavorable pricing, as well as due to a product mix shift. These declines were partially offset by the impacts from increased shipment volume and lower overall manufacturing costs across all geographic segments. Factors That May Impact Net Sales and Gross Margin Net product sales may continue to be affected by factors, including global economic downturns and related market uncertainty, that have resulted in reduced IT-related capital spending in our enterprise, service provider, public sector, and commercial markets; changes in the geopolitical environment and global economic conditions; competition, including price-focused competitors from Asia, especially from China; new product introductions; sales cycles and product implementation cycles; changes in the mix of our customers between service provider and enterprise markets; changes in the mix of direct sales and indirect sales; variations in sales channels; and final acceptance criteria of the product, system, or solution as specified by the customer. Sales to the service provider market have been and may be in the future characterized by large and sporadic purchases, especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain products within our Collaboration and Data Center product categories. In addition, service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader range of services, including network design services; and often have acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition. Certain of our customers in certain emerging countries also tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the net sales related to these transactions may similarly be affected by the timing of revenue recognition. As we focus on new market opportunities, customers may require greater levels of financing arrangements, service, and support, especially in certain emerging countries, which in turn may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition. To improve customer satisfaction, we continue to focus on managing our manufacturing lead-time performance, which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog. A decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quarter-to-quarter net sales and operating results. Net product sales may also be adversely affected by fluctuations in demand for our products, especially with respect to telecommunications service providers and Internet businesses, whether or not driven by any slowdown in capital expenditures in the service provider market; price and product competition in the communications and information technology industry; introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products; adoption of new networking standards; and financial difficulties experienced by our customers. We may, from time to time, experience manufacturing issues that create a delay in our suppliers’ ability to provide specific components, resulting in delayed shipments. To the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in periods when we and our suppliers are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters are not remediated within the same quarter. For additional factors that may impact net product sales, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Our distributors and retail partners participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs. Increased sales to our distributors and retail partners generally result in greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and, to a certain degree, the timing of orders from our customers. We recognize revenue for sales to our distributors and retail partners generally based on a sell-through method using information provided by them, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for all cooperative marketing and other programs. 60 Table of Contents Product gross margin may be adversely affected in the future by changes in the mix of products sold, including periods of increased growth of some of our lower margin products; introduction of new products, including products with price-performance advantages; our ability to reduce production costs; entry into new markets, including markets with different pricing structures and cost structures, as a result of internal development or through acquisitions; changes in distribution channels; price competition, including competitors from Asia, especially those from China; changes in geographic mix of our product sales; the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals; sales discounts; increases in material or labor costs, including share-based compensation expense; excess inventory and obsolescence charges; warranty costs; changes in shipment volume; loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing; effects of value engineering; inventory holding charges; and the extent to which we successfully execute on our strategy and operating plans. Additionally, our manufacturing-related costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain. Service gross margin may be impacted by various factors such as the change in mix between technical support services and advanced services; the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals; share-based compensation expense; and the timing of our strategic investments in headcount and resources to support this business. Research and Development (“R&D”), Sales and Marketing, and General and Administrative (“G&A”) Expenses R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses are summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Variancein Dollars Variancein Percent July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Variancein Dollars Variancein Percent Research and development $ 5,488 $ 5,823 $ (335 ) (5.8 )% $ 5,823 $ 5,273 $ 550 10.4 % Percentage of net sales 11.9 % 13.5 % 13.5 % 13.2 % Sales and marketing 9,647 9,812 (165 ) (1.7 )% 9,812 8,782 1,030 11.7 % Percentage of net sales 20.9 % 22.7 % 22.7 % 21.9 % General and administrative 2,322 1,908 414 21.7 % 1,908 1,933 (25 ) (1.3 )% Percentage of net sales 5.0 % 4.4 % 4.4 % 4.8 % Total $ 17,457 $ 17,543 $ (86 ) (0.5 )% $ 17,543 $ 15,988 $ 1,555 9.7 % Percentage of net sales 37.9 % 40.6 % 40.6 % 39.9 % Fiscal 2010 had an extra week compared with fiscal 2011. We estimate that the extra week contributed approximately $150 million of additional research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expense in fiscal 2010. R&D Expenses Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 The decrease in R&D expenses for fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, was primarily due to lower headcount-related expenses resulting from our restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and lower share-based compensation expense. Additionally, R&D expenses declined due to lower acquisition-related expenses, which was driven by the absence in fiscal 2012 of certain compensation payments that were paid in the prior year. We continue to invest in R&D in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. If we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal R&D. 61 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 The increase in R&D expenses for fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, was primarily due to higher headcount-related expenses, higher contracted services, and increased depreciation and equipment expenditures. The increase in depreciation expense was partially acquisition related. Sales and Marketing Expenses Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, sales and marketing expenses decreased by $165 million. Marketing expenses decreased by $204 million, which were partially offset by an increase of $39 million in sales expenses. The decrease in marketing expenses for the period was due to lower advertisement expenses, lower headcount-related expenses, and lower share-based compensation expense. The increase in sales expenses was due primarily to higher project related services, partially offset by lower headcount-related expenses and lower share-based compensation expense. The decline in headcount related expenses for both sales and marketing was in part attributable to our restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 Sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2011 increased compared with fiscal 2010 due to an increase of $851 million in sales expenses and an increase of $179 million in marketing expenses. Both the sales expense and the marketing expense components of the category increased for fiscal 2011 due to higher headcount-related expenses, as well as higher outside services costs, higher depreciation expense, and increased share-based compensation expense. Additionally, marketing expenses for fiscal 2011 increased due to higher advertisement expenses. G&A Expenses Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 G&A expenses increased in fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, primarily due to a net increase of approximately $300 million in real estate charges primarily for impairments on real estate held for sale, followed by other increased corporate-level expenses. The increase in real estate charges in fiscal 2012 was primarily due to charges of $202 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. These increased corporate-level expenses, which tend to vary from period to period, include increases related to our operational infrastructure such as real estate; IT project implementations, which include further investments in our global data center infrastructure, and investments related to operational and financial systems. Partially offsetting these increases were lower share-based compensation expense, and lower headcount-related expenses due to the restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 The decrease in G&A expenses in fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, was due to lower real estate charges in fiscal 2011 and the absence of non-income tax-related expenses (such as fees and licenses), which were included in fiscal 2010. Partially offsetting these items were higher headcount-related expenses, higher outside services costs for operational support areas, and increased equipment, depreciation, and rent expenses. Effect of Foreign Currency In fiscal 2012, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, increased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by $90 million, or approximately 0.5%, compared with fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2011, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, increased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by $53 million, or approximately 0.3%, compared with fiscal 2010. 62 Table of Contents Headcount Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 Our headcount decreased by 5,186 employees in fiscal 2012. The decrease was attributable to headcount reductions from the completion of the sale of our Juarez, Mexico manufacturing operations and from our restructuring actions initiated in July 2011. Partially offsetting these declines in headcount were headcount increases due to the growth of our service business and targeted hiring in engineering, which includes the hiring of recent university graduates. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, our headcount increased by 1,111 employees, the increase being attributable to targeted hiring as part of our investment in growth initiatives, partially offset by the impacts of our voluntary early retirement program and our restructuring activities, which began to reduce our headcount in late fiscal 2011. Share-Based Compensation Expense The following table presents share-based compensation expense (in millions): Years Ended July 28,2012 July 30,2011 July 31,2010 Cost of sales—product $ 53 $ 61 $ 57 Cost of sales—service 156 177 164 Share-based compensation expense in cost of sales 209 238 221 Research and development 401 481 450 Sales and marketing 588 651 602 General and administrative 203 250 244 Share-based compensation expense in operating expenses 1,192 1,382 1,296 Total share-based compensation expense $ 1,401 $ 1,620 $ 1,517 The year-over-year decrease in share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, was due primarily to a decrease in the aggregate value of share-based awards granted in recent periods, the timing of the annual grants to employees in fiscal 2012, and stock options awards from prior years becoming fully amortized and replaced with restricted stock units with a lower aggregate value. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, was due primarily to a change in vesting periods from five to four years for awards granted beginning in fiscal 2009, the timing of annual employee grants, and the overall growth in headcount and number of share-based awards granted on a year-over-year basis. Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets The following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses (in millions): Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Amortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses $ 383 $ 520 $ 491 The decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets for fiscal 2012, compared with fiscal 2011, was primarily due to the absence of significant impairment charges during fiscal 2012 and also due to certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized or impaired in fiscal 2011. For fiscal 2011, as 63 Table of Contents compared with fiscal 2010, the increase in the amortization of purchased intangible assets was due to impairment charges included in operating expenses of $92 million, partially offset by lower amortization due to certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized. The impairment charges in fiscal 2011 were primarily due to declines in estimated fair value as a result of reductions in expected future cash flows associated with certain of our consumer products. For additional information regarding purchased intangible assets, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. We consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets. Restructuring and Other Charges In fiscal 2012, we incurred within operating expenses net restructuring and other charges of approximately $304 million, consisting of $250 million of employee severance charges for employees subject to our workforce reduction and $54 million of other restructuring charges. In fiscal 2011, we incurred within operating expenses restructuring charges of $799 million. These charges included $453 million related to a voluntary early retirement program for eligible employees in the United States and Canada; $247 million related to employee severance for other employees subject to our reduction of our work force; and $71 million related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, primarily as a result of the sale of our Juarez, Mexico manufacturing operations. We also recorded charges within operating expenses of $28 million related to the consolidation of excess facilities and other activities. Operating Income The following table presents our operating income and our operating income as percentage of revenue (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Operating income $ 10,065 $ 7,674 $ 9,164 Operating income as a percentage of revenue 21.9 % 17.8 % 22.9 % In fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, our results reflect solid execution on delivering profitable growth, as we grew operating income faster than revenue. Operating income increased by 31%, as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 4.1 percentage points. The increase resulted from: revenue growth of 7%; effective expense management that resulted in lower total R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue; lower amortization of purchased intangible assets; lower restructuring and other charges; and lower share-based compensation expense. In fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 5.1 percentage points. The decrease was primarily the result of the following: a 2.6 percentage point decrease in gross margin; higher total R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue; and restructuring and other charges of $799 million. 64 Table of Contents Interest and Other Income, Net Interest Income (Expense), Net The following table summarizes interest income and interest expense (in millions): Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Variancein Dollars July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Variancein Dollars Interest income $ 650 $ 641 $ 9 $ 641 $ 635 $ 6 Interest expense (596 ) (628 ) 32 (628 ) (623 ) (5 ) Interest income (expense), net $ 54 $ 13 $ 41 $ 13 $ 12 $ 1 Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 Interest income increased slightly in fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011. The slight increase was due to increased income from financing receivables, partially offset by the effect of lower average interest rates on our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and fixed income investments. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, was attributable to the effect of lower average interest rates on our debt due to favorable hedging impacts. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 Interest income increased slightly in fiscal 2011 due to increased income from financing receivables, partially offset by the effect of lower average interest rates on our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and fixed income investments. The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, was due to higher average debt balances during fiscal 2011 attributable to our senior debt issuance in March 2011. Partially offsetting the impact of higher average debt balances during fiscal 2011 is the effect of lower average interest rates on our debt during fiscal 2011. Other Income, Net The components of other income, net, are summarized as follows (in millions): Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Variancein Dollars July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Variancein Dollars Gains (losses) on investments, net: Publicly traded equity securities $ 43 $ 88 $ (45 ) $ 88 $ 66 $ 22 Fixed income securities 58 91 (33 ) 91 103 (12 ) Total available-for-sale investments 101 179 (78 ) 179 169 10 Privately held companies (70 ) 34 (104 ) 34 54 (20 ) Net gains on investments 31 213 (182 ) 213 223 (10 ) Other gains (losses), net 9 (75 ) 84 (75 ) 16 (91 ) Other income, net $ 40 $ 138 $ (98 ) $ 138 $ 239 $ (101 ) Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 The decrease in total net gains on available-for-sale investments in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was attributable to lower gains on fixed income and publicly traded equity securities in fiscal 2012 as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the unrealized gains and losses on investments. For fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011, the change in net (losses) gains on investments in privately held companies was primarily due to equity method losses related to our proportional share of losses from our VCE joint venture increasing by $84 million for fiscal 2012. The change in other gains and (losses), net for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011, was primarily due to more favorable foreign exchange impacts in fiscal 2012. 65 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 The increase in total net gains on available-for-sale investments in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to higher gains on publicly traded equity securities, partially offset by lower gains on fixed income securities in fiscal 2011. These changes were the result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities. For fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010, the decline in net gains on investments in privately held companies was due to lower net equity method gains and lower gains on sales. The decline was partially offset by lower impairment charges on investments in privately held companies. Impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were $10 million and $25 million for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. The change in other gains and (losses), net for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010, was primarily due to fiscal 2011 experiencing lower gains from customer lease terminations, higher donations expense, and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates. Our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries. If these earnings were distributed to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 20.8% for fiscal 2012, compared with 17.1% for fiscal 2011. The net 3.7 percentage point increase in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was attributable to a smaller proportion of net income which was subject to foreign income tax rates that are lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and the expiration of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit on December 31, 2011, partially offset by other items including a reduction in state taxes. For a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 17.1% for fiscal 2011, compared with 17.5% for fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the “Ninth Circuit”) withdrew its prior holding and reaffirmed the 2005 U.S. Tax Court ruling in Xilinx, Inc. v. Commissioner. The net 0.4 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was attributable to the absence in fiscal 2011 of this tax benefit of $158 million, or 1.7 percentage points, offset by other items including the tax benefit of $188 million, or 2.5 percentage points, related to the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. federal R&D credit. 66 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, contractual obligations, other commitments, and the stock repurchase program on our liquidity and capital resources. Balance Sheet and Cash Flows Cash and Cash Equivalents and Investments The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments (in millions): July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Increase Cash and cash equivalents $ 9,799 $ 7,662 $ 2,137 Fixed income securities 37,297 35,562 1,735 Publicly traded equity securities 1,620 1,361 259 Total $ 48,716 $ 44,585 $ 4,131 The increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments was primarily the result of cash provided by operations of $11.5 billion, an increase from $10.1 billion in fiscal 2011. Significant uses of cash in fiscal 2012 included the repurchase of common stock (net of the issuance of common stock related to employee stock incentive plans) of $3.4 billion, cash dividends paid of $1.5 billion, capital expenditures of $1.1 billion, and the pay-down of short-term debt of $557 million. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 was primarily the result of an increase in net income and a smaller increase in financing receivables in fiscal 2012. Our total in cash and cash equivalents and investments held by various foreign subsidiaries was $42.5 billion and $39.8 billion as of July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011, respectively. Under current tax laws and regulations, if cash and cash equivalents and investments held outside the United States were to be distributed to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. The balance available in the United States as of July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011 was $6.2 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively. On July 30, 2012, subsequent to year end, we completed our acquisition of NDS Group Limited, which reduced our current balance of cash and cash equivalents and investments held by various foreign subsidiaries by approximately $5.0 billion. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our fixed income investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends. We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue, excess tax benefits resulting from share-based compensation, and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. For additional discussion, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report. 67 Table of Contents Accounts Receivable, Net The following table summarizes our accounts receivable, net (in millions), and DSO: July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Decrease Accounts receivable, net $ 4,369 $ 4,698 $ (329 ) DSO 34 38 (4 ) Our accounts receivable net, as of July 28, 2012 decreased by approximately 7% compared with the end of fiscal 2011. Our DSO as of July 28, 2012 was lower by 4 days compared with the end of fiscal 2011. The decrease in DSO was due to an improvement in shipment linearity during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Services billings have traditionally had the effect of increasing DSO due in part to the timing of billings, which in comparison to product billings, have a larger proportion billed in the latter part of the quarter. Given various factors such as our business mix, linearity, and the growth of our service business, going forward we expect DSO to continue to be in the range of 30 to 40 days. Inventory Supply Chain The following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in millions, except annualized inventory turns): July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Increase(Decrease) Inventories $ 1,663 $ 1,486 $ 177 Annualized inventory turns 11.7 11.8 (0.1 ) Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers $ 3,869 $ 4,313 $ (444 ) Inventory as of July 28, 2012 increased by 12% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2011, and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers declined by approximately 10%. On a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by 5% compared with the end of fiscal 2011. The inventory increase was due to higher levels of manufactured finished goods in support of current order activity. The decline in purchase commitments in fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, was due to the increased commitments we made in fiscal 2011 to secure our near-term supply needs as a result of supply constraints resulting from the earthquake in Japan. We believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts. Our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods. Distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers. Manufactured finished goods consist primarily of build-to-order and build-to-stock products. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. 68 Table of Contents We record a liability, included in other current liabilities, for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. The purchase commitments for inventory are expected to be primarily fulfilled within one year. Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels. Financing Receivables and Guarantees We measure our net balance sheet exposure position related to our financing receivables and financing guarantees by reducing the total of gross financing receivables and financing guarantees by the associated allowances for credit loss and deferred revenue. As of July 28, 2012, our net balance sheet exposure position related to financing receivables and financing guarantees was as follows (in millions): FINANCING RECEIVABLES FINANCINGGUARANTEES TOTAL July 28, 2012 LeaseReceivables LoanReceivables FinancedServiceContractsand Other Total ChannelPartner End-UserCustomers Total Gross amount less unearned income $ 3,179 $ 1,796 $ 2,651 $ 7,626 $ 277 $ 232 $ 509 $ 8,135 Allowance for credit loss (247 ) (122 ) (11 ) (380 ) — — — (380 ) Deferred revenue (71 ) (98 ) (1,838 ) (2,007 ) (193 ) (200 ) (393 ) (2,400 ) Net balance sheet exposure $ 2,861 $ 1,576 $ 802 $ 5,239 $ 84 $ 32 $ 116 $ 5,355 Financing Receivables Gross financing receivables less unearned income increased by 9% compared with the end of fiscal 2011. The change was primarily due to a 22% increase in loan receivables and an 11% increase in lease receivables. Gross financed service contracts and other increased by 1% compared with the end of fiscal 2011. We provide financing to certain end-user customers and channel partners to enable sales of our products, services, and networking solutions. These financing arrangements include leases, financed service contracts, and loans. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases. We also provide certain qualified customers financing for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services and advanced services. Our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term. Financing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are de-recognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. 69 Table of Contents Deferred Revenue Related to Financing Receivables and Guarantees The majority of the deferred revenue in the preceding table is related to financed service contracts. The majority of the revenue related to financed service contracts, which primarily relates to technical support services, is deferred as the revenue related to financed service contracts is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed. A portion of the revenue related to lease and loan receivables is also deferred and included in deferred product revenue based on revenue recognition criteria not currently having been met. Borrowings Senior Notes The following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes (in millions): July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Senior notes: Floating-rate notes, due 2014 $ 1,250 $ 1,250 1.625% fixed-rate notes, due 2014 2,000 2,000 2.90% fixed-rate notes, due 2014 500 500 5.50% fixed-rate notes, due 2016 3,000 3,000 3.15% fixed-rate notes, due 2017 750 750 4.95% fixed-rate notes, due 2019 2,000 2,000 4.45% fixed-rate notes, due 2020 2,500 2,500 5.90% fixed-rate notes, due 2039 2,000 2,000 5.50% fixed-rate notes, due 2040 2,000 2,000 Total $ 16,000 $ 16,000 Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable quarterly on the floating-rate notes. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of July 28, 2012. Commercial Paper In fiscal 2011 we established a short-term debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper notes. As of July 28, 2012, we had no commercial paper outstanding under this program. As of July 30, 2011, we had commercial paper notes of $500 million outstanding under this program. Other Notes and Borrowings Other notes and borrowings include notes and credit facilities with a number of financial institutions that are available to certain of our foreign subsidiaries. The amount of borrowings outstanding under these arrangements was $31 million and $88 million as of July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011, respectively. Credit Facility On February 17, 2012, we terminated our then-existing credit facility and entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on February 17, 2017. Any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the higher of the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, Bank of America’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time or one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%, or (ii) LIBOR plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement. As of July 28, 2012, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility. We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and/or extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to February 17, 2019. 70 Table of Contents Deferred Revenue The following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue (in millions): July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Increase(Decrease) Service $ 9,173 $ 8,521 $ 652 Product 3,707 3,686 21 Total $ 12,880 $ 12,207 $ 673 Reported as: Current $ 8,852 $ 8,025 $ 827 Noncurrent 4,028 4,182 (154 ) Total $ 12,880 $ 12,207 $ 673 The 8% increase in deferred service revenue in fiscal 2012 reflects the impact of new contract initiations and renewals, partially offset by the ongoing amortization of deferred service revenue. The slight increase in deferred product revenue was due to increased deferrals related to subscription revenue arrangements and, to a lesser extent, higher two-tier deferred revenue which was due to improved shipment linearity to two-tier partners during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. This increase was partially offset by decreased deferred revenue related to our financing arrangements. Contractual Obligations The impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. In addition, we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at July 28, 2012 (in millions): PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD July 28, 2012 Total Less than1 Year 1 to 3Years 3 to 5Years More than5 Years Operating leases $ 1,139 $ 328 $ 442 $ 167 $ 202 Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers 3,869 3,869 — — — Other purchase obligations 1,460 501 808 151 — Long-term debt 16,010 — 3,760 3,750 8,500 Other long-term liabilities 425 — 88 40 297 Total by period $ 22,903 $ 4,698 $ 5,098 $ 4,108 $ 8,999 Other long-term liabilities (uncertainty in the timing of future payments) 1,977 Total $ 24,880 Operating Leases For more information on our operating leases, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. A significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in “Inventory Supply Chain.” As of July 28, 2012, the liability for these purchase commitments was $193 million and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table. 71 Table of Contents Other Purchase Obligations Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations. Long-Term Debt The amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, noncurrent deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $1.8 billion and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of $133 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) partially offset by payments. Other Commitments In connection with our business combinations and asset purchases, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or continued employment with us of certain employees of acquired entities. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $120 million as of July 28, 2012, compared with $192 million as of July 30, 2011. Insieme Networks, Inc. In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we made an investment in Insieme Networks, Inc. (“Insieme”), an early-stage company focused on research and development in the data center market. This investment includes $100 million of funding and a license to certain of our technology. As a result of this investment, we own approximately 86% of Insieme and have consolidated the results of Insieme in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. In connection with this investment, Insieme and we have entered into a put/call option agreement that provides us with the right to purchase the remaining interests in Insieme. In addition, the noncontrolling interest holders can require us to purchase their shares upon the occurrence of certain events. If we acquire the remaining interests of Insieme, the noncontrolling interest holders are eligible to receive two milestone payments, which will be determined using agreed-upon formulas based on revenue for certain of Insieme’s products. We will begin recognizing the amounts due under the milestone payments when it is determined that such payments are probable of being earned, which we expect may be in fiscal 2014. When such a determination is made, the milestone payments will then be recorded as compensation expense by us based on an estimate of the fair value of the amounts probable of being earned, pursuant to a vesting schedule. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the amounts probable of being earned and the continued vesting will result in adjustments to the recorded compensation expense. The maximum amount that could be recorded as compensation expense by us is approximately $750 million. The milestone payments, if earned, are expected to be paid primarily during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017. 72 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements. In the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers. These privately held companies and customers may be considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings and we have determined that as of July 28, 2012 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities. VCE is a joint venture that we formed in fiscal 2010 with EMC Corporation (“EMC”), with investments from VMware, Inc. (“VMware”) and Intel Corporation. VCE helps organizations leverage best-in-class technologies and disciplines from Cisco, EMC, and VMware to enable the transformation to cloud computing. As of July 28, 2012, our cumulative gross investment in VCE was approximately $392 million, inclusive of accrued interest, and our ownership percentage was approximately 35%. During fiscal 2012, we invested approximately $276 million in VCE. We account for our investment in VCE under the equity method and our portion of VCE’s net loss is recognized in other income, net. As of July 28, 2012, we have recorded cumulative losses since inceptions from VCE of $239 million. Our carrying value in VCE as of July 28, 2012 was $153 million. Over the next 12 months, as VCE scales its operations, we expect that we will make additional investments in VCE and may incur additional losses proportionate with our share ownership. From time to time, EMC and Cisco may enter into guarantee agreements on behalf of VCE to indemnify third parties, such as customers, for monetary damages. Such guarantees were not material as of July 28, 2012. On an ongoing basis, we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events. We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing Receivables and Guarantees.” Securities Lending We periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale investments. These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. The average daily balance of securities lending for fiscal 2012 and 2011 was $0.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. As of July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011, we had no outstanding securities lending transactions. We believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements. 73 Table of Contents Stock Repurchase Program In September 2001, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program. As of July 28, 2012, our Board of Directors had authorized an aggregate repurchase of up to $82 billion of common stock under this program, and the remaining authorized repurchase amount was $5.9 billion with no termination date.

Any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for capital resources. 74 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our financial position is exposed to a variety of risks, including interest rate risk, equity price risk, and foreign currency exchange risk. Interest Rate Risk Fixed Income Securities We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk. At any time, a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates, including the impact from lower credit spreads, could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives. We had no outstanding hedging instruments for our fixed income securities as of July 28, 2012. Our fixed income investments are held for purposes other than trading. Our fixed income investments are not leveraged as of July 28, 2012. We monitor our interest rate and credit risks, including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers. As of July 28, 2012, approximately 80% of our fixed income securities balance consists of U.S. government and U.S. government agency securities. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong. The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our fixed income securities, including the hedging effects when applicable, as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates. The market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (“BPS”), plus 100 BPS, and plus 150 BPS. Due to the low interest rate environment at the end of each of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, we did not believe a parallel shift of minus 100 BPS or minus 150 BPS was relevant. The hypothetical fair values as of July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011 are as follows (in millions): VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTS FAIR VALUEAS OFJULY 28,2012 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Fixed income securities N/A N/A $ 37,483 $ 37,297 $ 37,111 $ 36,924 $ 36,737 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTS FAIR VALUEAS OFJULY 30, 2011 VALUATION OF SECURITIESGIVEN AN INTEREST RATEINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Fixed income securities N/A N/A $ 35,740 $ 35,562 $ 35,384 $ 35,206 $ 35,029 Impairment charges on our investments in fixed income securities were not material for fiscal 2012, 2011, or 2010. Debt As of July 28, 2012, we had $16.0 billion in principal amount of senior notes outstanding, which consisted of $1.25 billion floating-rate notes and $14.75 billion fixed-rate notes. The carrying amount of the senior notes was $16.3 billion, and the related fair value was $18.8 billion, which fair value is based on market prices. As of July 28, 2012, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed-rate debt, excluding the $4.25 billion of hedged debt, by a decrease or increase of $0.6 billion, respectively. However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed-rate debt, which is not hedged. 75 Table of Contents Equity Price Risk The fair value of our equity investments in publicly traded companies is subject to market price volatility. We may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio. Our equity portfolio consists of securities with characteristics that most closely match the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index or NASDAQ Composite Index. These equity securities are held for purposes other than trading. To manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain equity securities, we may enter into equity derivatives designated as hedging instruments. Publicly Traded Equity Securities The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of publicly traded equity securities as a result of selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each equity security in the portfolio, excluding hedged equity securities, if any. Potential fluctuations in the price of each equity security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 20%, and 30% were selected based on potential near-term changes in those security prices.

Investments in Privately Held Companies We have also invested in privately held companies. These investments are recorded in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are accounted for using primarily either the cost or the equity method. As of July 28, 2012, the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was $858 million, compared with $796 million at July 30, 2011. Some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including, among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return. Our impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were $23 million, $10 million, and $25 million for fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. 76 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign exchange forward and option contracts outstanding at fiscal year-end are summarized in U.S. dollar equivalents as follows (in millions): July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 NotionalAmount Fair Value NotionalAmount Fair Value Forward contracts: Purchased $ 3,336 $ (10 ) $ 3,722 $ 9 Sold $ 1,566 $ 5 $ 1,225 $ (10 ) Option contracts: Purchased $ 2,478 $ 31 $ 1,547 $ 63 Sold $ 2,239 $ (25 ) $ 1,577 $ (12 ) We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on sales has not been material because our sales are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our sales to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations. Approximately 70% of our operating expenses are U.S.-dollar denominated. In fiscal 2012, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, increased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by $90 million, or approximately 0.5%, compared with fiscal 2011, and 0.3% in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010. To reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by non-U.S.-dollar denominated operating expenses and costs, we hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts. These hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons. In designing a specific hedging approach, we consider several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of exposures, costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument, and potential effectiveness of the hedge. The gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales. We also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables, investments, and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities. The market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables, investments, and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances. Our forward and option contracts generally have the following maturities: Maturities Forward and option contracts—forecasted transactions related to operating expenses and service cost of sales Up to 18 months Forward contracts—current assets and liabilities Up to 3 months Forward contracts—net investments in foreign subsidiaries Up to 6 months Forward contracts—long-term customer financings Up to 2 years Forward contracts—investments Up to 2 years We do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for trading purposes. 77 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 17:09:28.231768
