Management's Discussion and Analysisof Financial Condition and Results of OperationsBusiness StrategyCintas helps more than 900,000 businesses of all types and sizes, primarily in North America, as well as Latin America, Europe and Asia, get Ready™ to open their doors with confidence every day by providing a wide range of products and services that enhance our customers’ image and help keep their facilities and employees clean, safe and looking their best. With products and services including uniforms, floor care, restroom supplies, first aid and safety products, fire extinguishers and testing, and safety and compliance training, Cintas helps customers get Ready for the Workday™.We are North America's leading provider of corporate identity uniforms through rental and sales programs, as well as a significant provider of related business services, including entrance mats, restroom cleaning services and supplies, carpet and tile cleaning services, first aid and safety services and fire protection products and services.Cintas' principal objective is ""to exceed customers' expectations in order to maximize the long-term value of Cintas for shareholders and working partners,"" and it provides the framework and focus for Cintas' business strategy. This strategy is to achieve revenue growth for all of our products and services by increasing our penetration at existing customers and by broadening our customer base to include business segments to which we have not historically served. We will also continue to identify additional product and service opportunities for our current and future customers.To pursue the strategy of increasing penetration, we have a highly talented and diverse team of service professionals visiting our customers on a regular basis. This frequent contact with our customers enables us to develop close personal relationships. The combination of our distribution system and these strong customer relationships provides a platform from which we launch additional products and services.We pursue the strategy of broadening our customer base in several ways. Cintas has a national sales organization introducing all of our products and services to prospects in all business segments. Our broad range of products and services allows our sales organization to consider any type of business a prospect. We also broaden our customer base through geographic expansion, especially in our first aid and safety and fire protection businesses. Finally, we evaluate strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise.Results of OperationsGAAP requires companies to evaluate their reportable operating segments periodically and when certain events occur. As a result of a recent evaluation, effective June 1, 2015, Cintas realigned its organizational structure and updated its reportable operating segments in light of certain changes in its business including the acquisition of ZEE in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Cintas’ updated reportable operating segments are Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing, mats, mops and shop towels and other ancillary items. In addition to these rental items, restroom cleaning services and supplies, carpet and tile cleaning services and the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route are included within this reportable operating segment. The First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment consists of first aid and safety products and services. The remainder of Cintas’ business, which consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and its Direct Sale business, is included in All Other. All prior fiscal year results presented in the table on page 15 have been recast to reflect these new reportable operating segments. Cintas evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and income before income taxes. Revenue and income before income taxes for each of these reportable operating segments for the years ended May 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 are presented in Note 14 entitled Operating Segment Information of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."" The Company regularly reviews its operating segments for reporting purposes based on the information its chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance and makes changes when appropriate.Prior to June 1, 2015, Cintas classified its business into the following three reportable operating segments: the Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consisted of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing, mats, mops and shop towels and other ancillary items. In addition to these rental items, restroom cleaning services and supplies and carpet and tile cleaning services were also provided within this operating segment. The Uniform Direct Sales operating segment consisted of the direct sale of uniforms and related items. The First Aid and Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment consisted of first aid and safety products and services, and fire protection products and services.14Shred-it and the results of Shredding are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented as a result of selling the investment during fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2015, Cintas sold Storage and, as a result, its operations are also classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Shredding and Storage were previously included in the former Document Management Services reportable operating segment. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets and discontinued operations, the results of Shredding and Storage have been excluded from both continuing operations and operating segment results for all periods presented. Please see Note 16 entitled Discontinued Operations of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for additional information.The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percent of revenue by reportable operating segment, All Other and in total for the fiscal years ended May 31: 2016(1) 2015(1)(2) 2014(1)(2) Revenue: Uniform Rental and Facility Services77.0% 79.1% 78.8%First Aid and Safety Services9.4% 7.3% 7.0%All Other13.6% 13.6% 14.2%Total revenue100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of sales: Uniform Rental and Facility Services55.8% 56.7% 58.2%First Aid and Safety Services57.3% 53.4% 53.8%All Other60.7% 61.2% 61.1%Total cost of sales56.6% 57.1% 58.3% Gross margin: Uniform Rental and Facility Services44.2% 43.3% 41.8%First Aid and Safety Services42.7% 46.6% 46.2%All Other39.3% 38.8% 38.9%Total gross margin43.4% 42.9% 41.7% Selling and administrative expenses: Uniform Rental and Facility Services26.4% 26.2% 26.0%First Aid and Safety Services31.9% 32.8% 32.6%All Other30.4% 31.4% 32.1%Total selling and administrative expenses27.5% 27.4% 27.4% Gain on sale of stock of an equity method investment—% 0.5% —% Interest expense, net1.3% 1.4% 1.5% Income from continuing operations before income taxes14.6% 14.6% 12.8%(1) The figures for all years presented reflect the change in classification of Shred-it, Shredding and Storage to discontinued operations within the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 16 entitled Discontinued Operations of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.""(2) Cintas' reportable operating segments changed effective June 1, 2015. All prior fiscal periods have been recast to reflect that change. 15Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015 Fiscal 2016 total revenue was $4.9 billion, an increase of 9.6% over the prior fiscal year. Revenue increased organically by 6.7% as a result of increased sales volume. Organic growth adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, workday differences and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Total revenue was positively impacted by 2.7% due to acquisitions and 0.9% due to two more workdays in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Revenue growth was also negatively impacted by 0.7% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.Organic growth by quarter is shown in the table below. Organic Growth First Quarter Ending August 31, 20156.8%Second Quarter Ending November 30, 20156.5%Third Quarter Ending February 29, 20166.8%Fourth Quarter Ending May 31, 20166.7% For the Fiscal Year Ending May 31, 20166.7%Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue consists predominantly of revenue derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms and other garments, including flame resistant clothing, and the rental and/or sale of mats, mops, shop towels, restroom supplies and other rental services. Revenue from the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment increased 6.7% compared to fiscal 2015. The increase resulted from an organic growth increase in revenue of 6.4%. The amount of new business grew, resulting from an increase in the number and productivity of sales representatives. Generally, sales productivity improvements are the result of increased tenure and improved training, which result in a higher number of products and services sold. Revenue growth was negatively impacted 0.8% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Revenue was positively impacted by 0.3% due to acquisitions and 0.8% due to two more workdays in fiscal 2016 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.Other revenue, consisting of revenue from the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other, increased 20.3% compared to fiscal 2015. Revenue increased organically by 8.0% due primarily to improved sales representative productivity. Revenue growth was negatively impacted by 0.4% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Cost of uniform rental and facility services increased 4.9% compared to fiscal 2015. Cost of uniform rental and facility services consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory, including uniforms, mats, shop towels and other ancillary items.

Cost of other services increased 22.1% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily related to the increased sales volumes in the First Aid and Safety Services segment and All Other.Selling and administrative expenses increased $123.2 million, or 10.1%, compared to fiscal 2015 due primarily to increases in labor and other employee-partner related expenses. During fiscal 2015, Cintas sold stock in an equity method investment. In conjunction with the sale of the equity method investment, the Company received a cash dividend. The sale resulted in the recording of a gain of $21.7 million in fiscal 2015. Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) was $63.6 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $64.8 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease in net interest expense is primarily due to the capitalization of $1.1 million of interest in fiscal year 2016 versus $0.6 million of interest in fiscal 2015. 16Income before income taxes was $718.1 million, an increase of $64.8 million, or 9.9%, compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in income before income taxes was due primarily to revenue growing at a faster rate than expenses. Cintas' effective tax rate on continuing operations was 36.4% for fiscal 2016 compared to 37.2% in fiscal 2015. The decrease in fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of the benefit derived from the closing of a prior-year Federal tax audit. See Note 8 entitled Income Taxes of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for more information.Net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2016 of $456.9 million was an 11.3% increase compared to fiscal 2015. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.09 was an 18.2% increase compared to fiscal 2015. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased due to an increase in earnings from continuing operations combined with a decrease in weighted average common shares outstanding. The decrease in weighted average common shares outstanding resulted from purchasing 8.7 million shares of common stock under the January 13, 2015 and August 4, 2015 share buyback programs since the beginning of the fiscal 2016. Uniform Rental and Facility Services Reportable Operating SegmentUniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue increased $238.0 million, or 6.7%, and the cost of uniform rental and facility services increased $99.2 million, or 4.9%. The reportable operating segment's fiscal 2016 gross margin was 44.2% of revenue compared to 43.3% in fiscal 2015. The 90 basis point improvement was driven by many factors, including new business sold by sales representatives, penetration of additional products and services into existing customers, and continuously improving the efficiency of internal processes. In addition, lower energy-related expenses increased gross margin 50 basis points.Selling and administrative expenses for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment increased $71.9 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to increases in labor and other employee-partner related expenses.

The gross margin as a percent of revenue was 42.7% for fiscal 2016 compared to 46.6% in fiscal 2015. ZEE integration costs and the lower efficiency of the acquired ZEE routes were primarily responsible for the decrease in gross margin.

These senior notes are comprised of $250.0 million of 30-year senior notes issued in fiscal 2007 at a rate of 6.15%, $300.0 million of 10-year senior notes issued in fiscal 2008 at a rate of 6.125%, $250.0 million of 5-year senior notes issued in fiscal 2011 at a rate of 2.85%, $250.0 million of 10-year senior notes issued in 2011 at a rate of 4.30% and $250.0 million of 10-year senior notes issued in fiscal 2012 at a rate of 3.25%. On June 1, 2016, Cintas paid the $250.0 million 5-year senior notes issued in fiscal 2011 with cash and $218.5 million proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper.Cintas' commercial paper program has a capacity of $300.0 million that is fully supported by a backup revolving credit facility through a credit agreement with its banking group. This revolving credit facility has an accordion feature that allows for a maximum borrowing capacity of $450.0 million. The revolving credit facility was amended on May 29, 2014 to extend that maturity date from October 6, 2016 to May 28, 2019, to adjust the applicable margin used to calculate the interest payable on any outstanding loans, and to adjust the facility fee payable under the agreement. In June 2016, the revolving credit facility was amended to extend the maturity date from May 28, 2019 to June 22, 2021, increase the capacity to $450.0 million, and add an accordion feature that allows for a maximum borrowing capacity of $600.0 million. We believe that this program, along with cash generated from operations, will be adequate to provide necessary funding for our future cash requirements. No commercial paper or borrowings on our revolving credit facility were outstanding at May 31, 2016 or 2015. Cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements. These covenants limit our ability to incur certain liens, to engage in sale-leaseback transactions and to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of Cintas' assets. These covenants also require Cintas to maintain certain debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and interest coverage ratios. Cross-default provisions exist between certain debt instruments. If a default of a significant covenant were to occur, the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness, impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital. As of May 31, 2016, Cintas was in compliance with all debt covenants.Our access to the commercial paper and long-term debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity. We do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past. Our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend, to a significant degree, on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness. As of May 31, 2016, our ratings were as follows:Rating Agency Outlook Commercial Paper Long-term Debt Standard & Poor's Stable A-2 A-Moody's Investors Service Stable P-1 A2In the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding long-term debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason, or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of long-term debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above, particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings, our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected. In addition, in such a case, our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and long-term debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.To monitor our credit rating and our capacity for long-term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. One such factor is the ratio of our total debt to EBITDA. For the purpose of this calculation, debt is defined as the sum of short-term borrowings, long-term debt due within one year, obligations under capital leases due in one year, long-term debt and long-term obligations under capital leases. 21Long-Term Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period(In thousands)Total One yearor less Two tothree years Four tofive years After fiveyears Long-term debt (1)$1,300,000 $250,000 $300,000 $— $750,000Operating leases (2)134,044 30,540 47,592 29,015 26,897Interest payments (3)467,438 56,188 86,875 68,500 255,875Unconditional purchase obligations— — — — —Total long-term contractual cash obligations$1,901,482 $336,728 $434,467 $97,515 $1,032,772Cintas also makes payments to defined contribution plans. The amount of contributions made to the defined contribution plans are at the discretion of the Board of Directors of Cintas. Future contributions are expected to be $46.9 million in the next year, $100.9 million in the next two to three years, and $111.2 million in the next four to five years.(1) Long-term debt consists of $1,300.0 million in senior notes (reference Note 6 entitled Long-Term Debt and Derivatives of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for a detailed discussion of long-term debt).(2) Operating leases consist primarily of operational facility leases.(3) Interest payments could include interest on both fixed and variable rate debt.

Management believes inflation has not had a material impact on Cintas' consolidated financial condition or a negative impact on consolidated results of operations.Litigation and Other ContingenciesCintas is subject to legal proceedings, insurance receipts, legal settlements and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary course of business actions will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows of Cintas. New Accounting StandardsIn February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2013-02, ""Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income."" ASU 2013-02 requires an entity to present (either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes) the effects on the line items of net income of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income if the item reclassified is required under GAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. For reclassification items not required under GAAP to be reclassified directly to net income in their entirety in the same reporting period, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures currently required under GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts. The Company adopted 22ASU 2013-02 effective June 1, 2013. See Note 13 entitled Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for details of the required disclosure.In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, “Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity,” which amended accounting guidance related to the reporting of discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity. The amended guidance changes the thresholds for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations and requires additional disclosures. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014 and is required to be applied prospectively. Cintas adopted ASU 2014-08 during the quarter ended August 31, 2015 and applied the amended accounting guidance to Shred-it and will apply it to future transactions, as appropriate.In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),"" to clarify revenue recognition principles. This guidance is intended to improve disclosure requirements and enhance the comparability of revenue recognition practices. Improved disclosures under the amended guidance relate to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized from contracts with customers. This guidance will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and will be required to be applied retrospectively. Early application of the amendments in this update is not permitted. Cintas is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, “Balance Sheet Classifications of Deferred Taxes,” which amended accounting guidance related to the presentation of deferred tax liabilities and assets. The amended guidance requires that all deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016; however, early adoption is permitted. This guidance can also be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. Cintas adopted ASU 2015-17 during the quarter ended November 30, 2015 and has applied this amended accounting guidance to its deferred tax liabilities and assets for all periods presented. The impact of this change in accounting principle on balances previously reported as of May 31, 2015 was a reclassification of $112.4 million from current liabilities to long term liabilities.In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. Topic 842 supersedes the previous leases standard, ASC 840, ""Leases"". This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. However, early adoption is permitted. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. Cintas is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements.In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, ""Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting."" ASU 2016-09 is intended to simplify accounting for share-based payments. Upon adoption, ASU 2016-09 will require that excess tax benefits for share-based payments be recorded as a reduction of income tax expense and reflected within operating cash flows rather than being recorded within equity and reflected within financing cash flows. The standard also permits the repurchase of more of an employee’s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting, clarifies that all cash payments made on an employee’s behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on our cash flows statement, and provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. This update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016; however, early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the effect that adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements.No other new accounting pronouncement recently issued or newly effective had or is expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.23Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of Cintas' consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with Note 1 entitled Significant Accounting Policies of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."" Significant changes, estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.Revenue recognitionRental revenue, which is recorded in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, is recognized when services are performed. Other revenue, which is recorded in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segments and All Other, is recognized when either services are performed or when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer. Allowance for doubtful accountsCintas establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts. This allowance includes an estimate based on historical rates of collections and allowances for specific accounts identified as uncollectible. The allowance that is an estimate based on the Company's historical rates of collections is recorded for overdue amounts, beginning with a nominal percentage and increasing substantially as the account ages. The amount provided as the account ages will differ slightly between the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other because of differences in customers served and the nature of each business. When an account is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts.InventoriesInventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. Cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual and standard costs to the inventory balances. The judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventories at the lower of cost or market. An inventory obsolescence reserve is determined by specific identification, as well as an estimate based on the Company's historical rates of obsolescence.Uniforms and other rental items in serviceUniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization, calculated using the straight-line method. Uniforms in service (other than cleanroom and flame resistant clothing) are amortized over their useful life of 18 months. Other rental items, including shop towels, mats, mops, cleanroom garments, flame resistant clothing, linens and restroom dispensers, are amortized over their useful lives, which range from 8 to 60 months. The amortization rates used are based on industry experience, Cintas' specific experience and wear tests performed by Cintas. These factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory and related cost of uniforms and ancillary products that are presented in the consolidated financial statements.Property and equipmentDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets based on industry and Company specific experience, which is typically 30 to 40 years for buildings, 5 to 20 years for building improvements, 3 to 10 years for equipment and 2 to 15 years for leasehold improvements. When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the carrying amount of the assets. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss is recorded based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is generally determined by discounted cash flows or based on prices of similar assets, as appropriate. InvestmentsInvestments consists primarily of the cash surrender value of life insurance policies and equity method investments. The equity method is used to account for an investment if our investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. In general, equity method investments are initially measured at cost. However, an equity method investment resulting from a transaction in which a controlled group of assets that constitutes a business is deconsolidated is initially measured at fair value. Cintas recognizes its share of the investee’s earnings or losses in income. Cintas also adjusts its share of the investee's earnings for intra-entity 24transactions, basis differences, investee capital transactions and other comprehensive income through income or other comprehensive income as appropriate. Equity method investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. GoodwillGoodwill, obtained through acquisitions of businesses, is valued at cost less any impairment. Cintas completes an annual impairment test, which may include an assessment of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance. The test may also include the determination of the estimated fair value of Cintas' reporting units via comparisons to current market values, where available, and discounted cash flow analyses. Significant assumptions may include growth rates based on historical trends and margin improvement leveraged from such growth, as well as discount rates. We determine discount rates separately for each reporting unit using the weighted average cost of capital, which includes a calculation of cost of equity, which is developed using the capital asset pricing model and comparable company betas (a measure of systemic risk), and cost of debt. We also use comparable market earnings multiple data and our market capitalization to corroborate our reporting unit valuations. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. As a result of Cintas’ operating segment realignment, the composition of Cintas’ reporting units for the evaluation of goodwill impairment has changed. Historically, Cintas’ reporting units were the same as the reportable operating segments, Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services. Effective June 1, 2015, Cintas identified five reporting units for purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment, Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services, and three reporting units within All Other. As a result of the change in reporting units, Cintas was required to perform an interim impairment test on Goodwill at June 1, 2015. There was no impairment recorded as a result of the interim impairment test. Based on the results of the annual impairment tests, Cintas was not required to recognize an impairment of goodwill for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014. Cintas will continue to perform impairment tests as of March 1 in future years or when indicators of impairment exist.Service contracts and other assetsService contracts and other assets, which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses, are amortized by use of the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the agreements, which are generally 5 to 10 years. Certain noncompete agreements, as well as all service contracts, require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model. The assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates, among other factors. Because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets, actual results over time could vary from original estimates. Impairment of service contracts and other assets is accomplished through specific identification. No impairment has been recognized by Cintas for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014.General insurance liabilities General insurance liabilities represent the estimated ultimate cost of all asserted and unasserted claims incurred, primarily related to worker's compensation, auto liability and other general liability exposure through the consolidated balance sheet dates. Our reserves are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for specific expectations based on our claims history. Cintas records an increase or decrease in selling and administrative expenses related to development of prior claims, higher claims activity and other environmental factors in the period in which it becomes known. These changes in estimates may be material to the consolidated financial statements.Stock-based compensationCompensation expense is recognized for all share-based payments to employees, including stock options and restricted stock awards, in the consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of the awards that are granted. The fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Measured compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the related share-based compensation award. See Note 12 entitled Stock-Based Compensation of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for further information.Litigation and other contingenciesCintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. GAAP requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. 25Significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. While a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities, Cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements.Income taxesDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. See Note 8 entitled Income Taxes of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes. Cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets, as adjusted for valuation allowances, will be realized. Accounting for uncertain tax positions requires the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Companies may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.Cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions, Cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate. Based on Cintas' evaluation of current tax positions, Cintas believes its tax related accruals are appropriate.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskEarnings are affected by changes in short-term interest rates due to investments in marketable securities and money market accounts and periodic issuances of commercial paper. If short-term rates changed by one-half percent (or 50 basis points), Cintas' income before income taxes would change by approximately $0.3 million. This estimated exposure considers the effects on investments. This analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in Cintas' capital structure.Through its foreign operations, Cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk. Foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into U.S. dollars. Foreign denominated revenue and profit represents less than 10% of Cintas' consolidated revenue and profit. Cintas periodically uses foreign currency hedges such as average rate options and forward contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements resulting from foreign currency revenue and from international cash flows. The primary foreign currency to which Cintas is exposed is the Canadian dollar.26",2023-12-30 21:41:54.851167

This strategy is to achieve revenue growth for all of our products and services by increasing our penetration at existing customers and by broadening our customer base to include business segments to which we have not historically served. We will also continue to identify additional product and service opportunities for our current and future customers.To pursue the strategy of increasing penetration, we have a highly talented and diverse team of service professionals visiting our customers on a regular basis. This frequent contact with our customers enables us to develop close personal relationships. The combination of our distribution system and these strong customer relationships provides a platform from which we launch additional products and services.We pursue the strategy of broadening our customer base in several ways. Cintas has a national sales organization introducing all of our products and services to prospects in all business segments. Our broad range of products and services allows our sales organization to consider any type of business a prospect. We also broaden our customer base through geographic expansion, especially in our first aid and safety and fire protection businesses. Finally, we evaluate strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise.Results of OperationsOn March 21, 2017, Cintas completed the acquisition of G&K Services, Inc. (G&K) for consideration of approximately $2.1 billion. G&K is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cintas that will operate within the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment. To finance the G&K acquisition, Cintas used a combination of new senior notes, a term loan, other borrowings under its existing credit facility and cash on hand. G&K's results of operations are included in Cintas' consolidated financial statements as of and from the date of acquisition. U. S. GAAP requires companies to evaluate their reportable operating segments periodically and when certain events occur. As a result of our evaluation in fiscal 2016, effective June 1, 2015, Cintas realigned its organizational structure and updated its reportable operating segments in light of certain changes in its business, including the acquisition of ZEE Medical Inc. (ZEE) in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Cintas’ updated reportable operating segments are Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, which includes G&K, consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing, mats, mops and shop towels and other ancillary items. In addition to these rental items, restroom cleaning services and supplies, carpet and tile cleaning services and the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route are included within this reportable operating segment. The First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment, which includes ZEE, consists of first aid and safety products and services. The remainder of Cintas’ business, which consists of Fire Protection Services and its Uniform Direct Sale business, is included in All Other. Cintas evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and income before income taxes. Revenue and income before income taxes for each of these reportable operating segments for the years ended May 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are presented in Note 14 entitled Operating Segment Information of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."" The Company regularly reviews its operating segments for reporting purposes based on the information its chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance and makes changes when appropriate.15At May 31, 2017, Cintas has classified a significant business, referred to as Discontinued Services, as held for sale. Prior to meeting the held for sale criteria, Discontinued Services was primarily included in All Other. In fiscal 2014, Cintas completed its partnership transaction with the shareholders of Shred-it International Inc. to combine Shredding with the shredding business of Shred-it International Inc. Pursuant to the Shredding Transaction, the Shred-it Partnership was owned 42% by Cintas and 58% by the shareholders of Shred-it International Inc. Cintas' investment in Shred-it and the results of Shredding are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented as a result of selling the investment during fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2015, Cintas sold Storage and, as a result, its operations are also classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets and discontinued operations, the results of Discontinued Services, Shredding and Storage have been excluded from both continuing operations and operating segment results for all periods presented. Please see Note 16 entitled Discontinued Operations of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for additional information.The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percent of revenue by reportable operating segment, All Other and in total for the fiscal years ended May 31: 2017(1) 2016(1) 2015(1) Revenue: Uniform Rental and Facility Services79.0% 78.4% 80.5%First Aid and Safety Services9.5% 9.6% 7.5%All Other11.5% 12.0% 12.0%Total revenue100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of sales: Uniform Rental and Facility Services54.9% 55.7% 56.6%First Aid and Safety Services54.7% 57.3% 53.4%All Other58.3% 58.6% 59.1%Total cost of sales55.3% 56.2% 56.6% Gross margin: Uniform Rental and Facility Services45.1% 44.3% 43.4%First Aid and Safety Services45.3% 42.7% 46.6%All Other41.7% 41.4% 40.9%Total gross margin44.7% 43.8% 43.4% Selling and administrative expenses: Uniform Rental and Facility Services27.1% 26.5% 26.2%First Aid and Safety Services34.9% 31.9% 32.8%All Other34.5% 33.1% 34.3%Total selling and administrative expenses28.7% 27.8% 27.7% G&K Services, Inc. transaction and integration expenses1.5% —% —% Gain on sale of stock of an equity method investment—% —% 0.5% Interest expense, net1.6% 1.3% 1.5% Income from continuing operations before income taxes12.9%14.7%14.7%(1) The figures presented reflect the change in classification of Discontinued Services, Shredding and Storage to discontinued operations within the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 16 entitled Discontinued Operations of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.""16Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2017 total revenue was $5.3 billion, an increase of 11.0% over the prior fiscal year. Revenue increased organically by 6.7% as a result of increased sales volume. Organic growth adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, workday differences and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Total revenue was positively impacted by 4.8% due to acquisitions, primarily through the acquisition of G&K. Revenue growth was negatively impacted by 0.1% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and 0.4% due to one less workday in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Organic growth by quarter is shown in the table below. Organic Growth First Quarter Ending August 31, 20166.0%Second Quarter Ending November 30, 20166.0%Third Quarter Ending February 28, 20176.6%Fourth Quarter Ending May 31, 20178.1% For the Fiscal Year Ending May 31, 20176.7%Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue consists predominantly of revenue derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms and other garments, including flame resistant clothing, and the rental and/or sale of mats, mops, shop towels, restroom supplies and other rental services. Revenue from the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment increased 11.8% compared to fiscal 2016. The increase resulted from an organic growth increase in revenue of 6.9%. The amount of new business grew, resulting from an increase in the number and productivity of sales representatives. Generally, sales productivity improvements are the result of increased tenure and improved training, which result in a higher number of products and services sold. Revenue growth was negatively impacted by 0.1% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and 0.4% due to one less workday in fiscal 2017 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Revenue was positively impacted by 5.4% due to acquisitions, primarily G&K. Other revenue, consisting of revenue from the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other, increased 8.2% compared to fiscal 2016. Revenue increased organically by 6.1% due primarily to improved sales representative productivity. Revenue growth was negatively impacted by 0.1% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and 0.4% due to one less workday in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Acquisitions positively impacted revenue by 2.6%.Cost of uniform rental and facility services increased 10.3% compared to fiscal 2016. Cost of uniform rental and facility services consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory, including uniforms, mats, shop towels and other ancillary items. The cost of uniform rental and facility services increase compared to fiscal 2016 was due to increased Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment sales volume from internal growth and the acquired G&K sales volume.Cost of other consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly first aid and safety products, uniforms and fire protection products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other. Cost of other increased 5.6% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily related to the increased sales volumes in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other.Selling and administrative expenses increased $195.0 million, or 14.6%, compared to fiscal 2016 due primarily to increases in labor and other employee-partner related expenses. As a result of the acquisition of G&K in fiscal 2017, the Company incurred various transaction and integration expenses which relate primarily to asset impairment charges, legal and professional fees, employee termination expenses, the write-off of excess inventory and other miscellaneous expenses. In fiscal 2017, G&K transaction and integration expenses were $79.2 million or 1.5% of total revenue. Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) was $86.3 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $63.6 million in fiscal 2016. The increase in net interest expense is primarily due to the additional debt issued to finance the G&K acquisition and $17.1 million of short-term debt financing fees incurred in connection with the acquisition. 17Income before income taxes was $687.4 million, a decrease of $17.9 million, or 2.5%, compared to fiscal 2016. The decrease in income before income taxes was due to the G&K transaction and integration expenses and the increase in interest expense previously mentioned. These impacts were partially offset by the increase in gross margin. Cintas' effective tax rate on continuing operations was 33.5% for fiscal 2017 compared to 36.4% in fiscal 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the adoption of Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2016-09, ""Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting."" The effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 included a benefit of $29.4 million as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09. This benefit was partially offset by the election to recognize forfeitures as they occur, which resulted in additional stock compensation expense of $8.3 million when compared to our historical practice of estimating forfeiture for expense purposes. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 also resulted in an increase in the effect of dilutive securities in fiscal 2017 of 0.8 million shares. For fiscal 2017, the net impact on diluted earnings per share from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 was an increase of $0.19 per share over what diluted earnings per share would have been if ASU 2016-09 was not adopted in the current year. Net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2017 of $457.3 million was a 1.9% increase compared to fiscal 2016. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.17 was a 3.7% increase compared to fiscal 2016. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased due to the lower effective tax rate combined with the decrease in weighted average common shares outstanding. The decrease in weighted average common shares outstanding resulted from purchasing 8.8 million shares of common stock under the January 13, 2015 and August 4, 2015 share buyback programs since the beginning of fiscal 2016. Uniform Rental and Facility Services Reportable Operating SegmentUniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue increased $443.0 million, or 11.8%, and the cost of uniform rental and facility services increased $214.9 million, or 10.3%, as previously discussed. The reportable operating segment's fiscal 2017 gross margin was 45.1% of revenue compared to 44.3% in fiscal 2016. The 80 basis point improvement was driven by many factors, including new business sold by sales representatives, penetration of additional products and services into existing customers and continuously improving the efficiency of internal processes. Selling and administrative expenses for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment increased $143.8 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue for fiscal 2017 was 27.1% compared to 26.5% in fiscal 2016. The increase in selling and administrative expenses for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment is primarily related to the G&K acquisition.As a result of the G&K acquisition, the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment incurred $79.2 million of transaction and integration expenses. These expenses consisted of the following: asset impairment charges of $23.3 million, legal and professional fees directly related to the acquisition of $17.4 million, employee termination expenses recognized under ASC Topic 712, ""Compensation - Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits"" of $31.0 million, write-off of excess inventory of $5.5 million and $2.0 million of other miscellaneous integration expenses. Income before income taxes increased $5.0 million to $677.1 million for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Income before income taxes as a percent of revenue, at 16.1%, decreased 180 basis points from 17.9% in fiscal 2016. The decrease is primarily due to the G&K transaction and integration expenses mentioned above. First Aid and Safety Services Reportable Operating SegmentFirst Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment revenue increased $46.5 million in fiscal 2017, a 10.1% increase compared to fiscal 2016. Revenue increased organically by 5.9% as a result of increased sales volume. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 4.6% due to acquisitions. One less workday in fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year negatively impacted growth by 0.4%. Cost of first aid and safety services increased $13.3 million, or 5.0%, in fiscal 2017, due primarily to increased First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment volume. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment is defined as revenue less cost of goods, warehouse expenses, service expenses and training expenses. The gross margin as a percent of revenue was 45.3% for fiscal 2017 compared to 42.7% in fiscal 2016. The increase in gross margin was due to the benefits realized as a result of the integration of ZEE. These benefits included improved delivery efficiencies and improved sourcing of goods.Selling and administrative expenses for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment increased by $29.9 million, or 20.3%, in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of 18revenue were 34.9% in fiscal 2017 compared to 31.9% in fiscal 2016. The increase in selling and administrative expenses is primarily the result of the investment in selling resources to grow the acquired ZEE customer base and increases in various employee-partner related expenses. Income before income taxes was $52.8 million in fiscal 2017, an increase of $3.3 million, or 6.6%, compared to fiscal 2016. Income before income taxes as a percent of revenue, at 10.4%, decreased from 10.7% in fiscal 2016, due primarily to the investment in selling resources mentioned above.Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015Fiscal 2016 total revenue was $4.8 billion, an increase of 9.8% over the prior fiscal year. Revenue increased organically by 6.8% as a result of increased sales volume. Organic growth excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and workday differences. Total revenue was positively impacted by 2.9% due to acquisitions and 0.8% due to two more workdays in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Revenue growth was negatively impacted by 0.7% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Organic growth by quarter is shown in the table below. Organic Growth First Quarter Ending August 31, 20156.9%Second Quarter Ending November 30, 20156.6%Third Quarter Ending February 28, 20167.1%Fourth Quarter Ending May 31, 20166.8% For the Fiscal Year Ending May 31, 20166.8%Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue consists predominantly of revenue derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms and other garments, including flame resistant clothing, and the rental and/or sale of mats, mops, shop towels, restroom supplies and other rental services. Revenue from the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment increased 6.8% compared to fiscal 2015. The increase resulted from an organic growth increase in revenue of 6.5%. The amount of new business grew, resulting from an increase in the number and productivity of sales representatives. Generally, sales productivity improvements are the result of increased tenure and improved training, which result in a higher number of products and services sold. Revenue was positively impacted by 0.3% due to acquisitions, 0.8% due to two more workdays in fiscal 2016 compared to 2015 and negatively impacted by 0.8% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.Other revenue, consisting of revenue from the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other, increased 21.8% compared to fiscal 2015. The increase primarily resulted from an organic growth increase of 8.3%, which was largely due to improved sales representative productivity. Revenue in fiscal 2016 was negatively impacted by 0.5% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Acquisitions positively impacted the growth rate by 13.0%, and two more workdays in fiscal 2016 contributed an additional 1.0%. Cost of uniform rental and facility services increased 5.0% compared to fiscal 2015. Cost of uniform rental and facility services consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory, including uniforms, mats, shop towels and other ancillary items. The increase in the cost of uniform rental and facility services compared to fiscal 2015 was due to increased Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment sales volume. Cost of other increased 24.3% compared to fiscal 2015. Cost of other consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly first aid and safety products, uniforms and fire protection products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other. The increase from fiscal 2015 was primarily due to increased First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment sales volume. Selling and administrative expenses increased $123.1 million, or 10.2%, compared to fiscal 2015 due primarily to increases in labor and other employee-partner related expenses.During fiscal 2015, Cintas sold stock in an equity method investment. In conjunction with the sale of the equity method investment, the Company received a cash dividend. The sale resulted in the recording of a gain of $21.7 million in fiscal 2015. 19Operating income of $768.9 million in fiscal 2016 increased $85.3 million, or 12.5%, compared to fiscal 2015.Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) was $63.6 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $64.8 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease in net interest expense is primarily due to the capitalization of $1.1 million of interest in fiscal year 2016 versus $0.6 million of interest capitalized in fiscal 2015.Income before income taxes was $705.3 million, an increase of $64.8 million, or 10.1%, compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in income before income taxes was primarily due to revenue growing at a faster rate than expenses. Cintas' effective tax rate in fiscal 2016 was 36.4%, which was comparable to the effective tax rate of 37.2% in fiscal 2015. See Note 8 entitled Income Taxes of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for more information on income taxes.Net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2016 of $448.6 million was a 11.4% increase compared to fiscal 2015. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.02 was a 18.6% increase compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in diluted earnings per share is higher than the increase in net income due to a decrease in weighted average common stock outstanding as a result of Cintas purchasing 8.7 million shares of common stock under the January 13, 2015 share buyback program since the beginning of fiscal 2016.Uniform Rental and Facility Services Reportable Operating SegmentUniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue increased $240.3 million, or 6.8%, and the cost of uniform rental and facility services increased $100.2 million, or 5.0%. Revenue in fiscal 2016 was negatively affected by 0.8% due to foreign currency exchange rate changes compared to fiscal 2015 and positively affected by 0.3% due to acquisitions and 0.8% due to two more workdays in fiscal 2016 compared to 2015. The reportable operating segment's fiscal 2016 gross margin was 44.3% of revenue compared to 43.4% in fiscal 2015. The increase in gross margin as a percent of revenue over fiscal 2015 was due to new business sold by sales representatives, penetration of additional products and services into existing customers, and continuously improving the efficiency of internal processes. In addition, lower energy-related expenses increased gross margin 50 basis points.Selling and administrative expenses for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment increased $72.0 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to increases in labor and other employee-partner related expenses. Selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue for fiscal 2016 was 26.5% compared to 26.2% in fiscal 2015. Income before income taxes increased $68.1 million to $672.1 million for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Income before income taxes as a percent of revenue, at 17.9%, increased from 17.2% in fiscal 2015. This increase is primarily due to the increase in gross margin.First Aid and Safety Services Reportable Operating SegmentFirst Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment revenue increased $135.2 million in fiscal 2016, a 41.4% increase compared to fiscal 2015. Revenue increased organically by 9.7% as a result of increased sales volume. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 1.1% due to two more workdays in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The remaining 30.6% increase in growth represents growth derived through acquisitions, primarily the ZEE acquisition. Cost of first aid and safety services increased $90.5 million, or 51.9%, in fiscal 2016, due primarily to increased First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment volume. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment is defined as revenue less cost of goods, warehouse expenses, service expenses and training expenses. The gross margin as a percent of revenue was 42.7% for fiscal 2016 compared to 46.6% in fiscal 2015. ZEE integration costs and the lower efficiency of the acquired ZEE routes were primarily responsible for the decrease in gross margin. Selling and administrative expenses increased by $40.3 million, or 37.6%, in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to an increase in labor and other employee-partner related expenses and costs associated with the integration of ZEE. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue, at 31.9%, decreased from 32.8% in fiscal 2015. Income before income taxes was $49.5 million in fiscal 2016, an increase of $4.4 million, or 9.7%, compared to fiscal 2015. Income before income taxes as a percent of revenue, at 10.7%, decreased from 13.8% in fiscal 2015, due to the decrease in gross margin discussed above.20Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe following is a summary of our cash flows and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of and for the fiscal years ending May 31:(In thousands)2017 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities$763,887 $465,845Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities$(2,310,349) $128,381Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$1,578,502 $(866,724) Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period$169,266 $139,357Marketable securities at the end of the period$22,219 $70,405Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of May 31, 2017 and 2016 include $125.5 million and $96.5 million, respectively, that is located outside of the United States. We expect to use these amounts to fund our international operations and international expansion activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. We generally use these cash flows to fund most, if not all, of our operations and dividends on our common stock. We may also use cash flows provided by operating activities, as well as proceeds from long-term debt and short-term borrowings, to fund growth and expansion opportunities, as well as other cash requirements such as the repurchase of our common stock.Net cash provided by operating activities was $763.9 million for fiscal 2017, which was an increase of $298.0 million compared to fiscal 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 was negatively impacted by the $229.5 million payment of taxes due on the gain on the sale of Shred-it. Net cash used in investing activities was $2,310.3 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $128.4 million of net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2016. Capital expenditures were $273.3 million and $275.4 million for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 included $232.8 million for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment and $26.9 million for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment. Cash paid for acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired was $2,102.4 million and $156.6 million for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. The acquisitions in both fiscal 2017 and 2016 occurred in our Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, which includes G&K, our First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and our Fire Protection business, which is included in All Other. Net cash provided by investing activities included proceeds related to the sale of Shred-it and Storage of $28.3 million and $616.2 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2017 also included net proceeds of $37.3 million from purchases and redemptions of marketable securities and investments compared to net purchases of $60.0 million in fiscal 2016. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,578.5 million for fiscal 2017, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $866.7 million for fiscal 2016. The increase from fiscal 2017 over fiscal 2016 is primarily due to the net issuance of $1,732.7 million of debt and the decrease in stock buybacks. To finance the G&K acquisition, Cintas issued various forms of debt, totaling $2,091.2 million, net. In addition, on June 1, 2016, Cintas paid the $250.0 million five-year senior notes that matured on that date with cash on hand and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper.On August 4, 2015, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $500.0 million share buyback program, which does not have an expiration date. During fiscal 2017, we purchased 0.1 million shares at an average price of $94.09 per share for a total purchase price of $3.7 million. This completed the August 4, 2015 program through which Cintas purchased a total of 5.7 million shares of Cintas common stock at an average price of $87.89 for a total purchase price of $500.0 million. During fiscal 2016, we purchased $759.2 million of common stock under previously authorized share buyback programs. On August 2, 2016, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a new $500.0 million share buyback program, which does not have an expiration date. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017, Cintas acquired 0.2 million shares of Cintas common stock in satisfaction of employee payroll taxes due on restricted stock awards that vested during the fiscal year. These shares were acquired at an average price of $101.37 per share for a total purchase price of $17.0 million.21On October 18, 2016, Cintas declared an annual cash dividend of $1.33 per share on outstanding common stock, a26.7% increase over the annual dividend paid in the prior year. The dividend was paid on December 2, 2016 to shareholders of record as of November 4, 2016. This marked the 34th consecutive year that Cintas has increased its annual dividend, every year since going public in 1983.On March 21, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of G&K. To finance the G&K acquisition, Cintas used a combination of new senior notes, a term loan, other borrowings under its existing credit facility and cash on hand. The following table summarizes Cintas' outstanding debt at May 31:(In thousands)Interest Rate Fiscal Year Issued Fiscal Year Maturity 2017 2016 Debt due within one year Senior notes2.85% 2007 2017 $— $250,000Senior notes6.13% 2008 2018 300,000 —Commercial paper1.24%(1) Various Various 50,500 —Current portion of term loan2.00%(1) 2017 2018 12,500 —Debt issuance costs (100) —Total debt due within one year $362,900 $250,000 Debt due after one year Senior notes6.13% 2008 2018 $— $300,000Senior notes4.30% 2012 2022 250,000 250,000Senior notes2.90% 2017 2022 650,000 —Senior notes3.25% 2013 2023 300,000 250,000Senior notes (2)2.78% 2013 2023 52,554 —Senior notes (3)3.11% 2015 2025 52,645 —Senior notes3.70% 2017 2027 1,000,000 —Senior notes6.15% 2007 2037 250,000 250,000Long-term portion of term loan2.00%(1) 2017 2022 237,500 —Debt issuance costs (22,075) (5,578) Total debt due after one year $2,770,624 $1,044,422(1) Variable rate debt instrument. The rate presented is the variable borrowing rate at May 31, 2017. (2) Cintas assumed these senior notes with the acquisition of G&K, and they were recorded at fair value. The interest rate shown above is the effective interest rate. The principal amount of these notes is $50.0 million with a stated interest rate of 3.73%. (3) Cintas assumed these senior notes with the acquisition of G&K, and they were recorded at fair value. The interest rate shown above is the effective interest rate. The principal amount of these notes is $50.0 million with a stated interest rate of 3.88%. The credit agreement that supports our commercial paper program was amended on September 16, 2016. The amendment increased the capacity of the revolving credit facility from $450.0 million to $600.0 million and added a $250.0 million term loan facility. The $150.0 million increase in the revolving credit facility took effect upon the consummation of the merger (Merger) contemplated by the Merger Agreement among the Cintas, G&K and Bravo Merger Sub, Inc. (Merger Sub), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cintas. The term loan was funded upon the consummation of the Merger. The credit agreement has an accordion feature that provides Cintas the ability to request increases to the borrowing commitments under either the revolving credit facility or the term loan of up to $250.0 million in the aggregate, subject to customary conditions. The maturity date of the agreement is September 15, 2021. As of May 31, 2017, there was $50.5 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 1.24% and maturity dates less than 30 days and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility. No commercial paper or borrowings on our revolving credit facility were outstanding at May 31, 2016. Cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements. These covenants limit Cintas' ability to incur certain liens, to engage in sale-leaseback transactions and to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of Cintas' assets. These covenants also require Cintas to maintain certain debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and interest coverage ratios. Cross-default provisions exist between certain debt instruments. If a default of a significant covenant were to occur, the default could result in an acceleration of the 22maturity of the indebtedness, impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital. Cintas was in compliance with all of the debt covenants for all periods presented. Our access to the commercial paper and long-term debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity. We do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past. Our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend, to a significant degree, on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness. As of May 31, 2017, our ratings were as follows:Rating Agency Outlook Commercial Paper Long-term Debt Standard & Poor’s Stable A-2 BBB+Moody’s Investors Service Stable P-2 A3 In the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding long-term debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason, or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of long-term debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above, particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings, our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected. In addition, in such a case, our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and long-term debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies. To monitor our credit rating and our capacity for long-term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. One such factor is the ratio of our total debt to EBITDA. For the purpose of this calculation, debt is defined as the sum of short-term borrowings, long-term debt due within one year, obligations under capital leases due in one year, long-term debt and long-term obligations under capital leases.

The amount of contributions made to the defined contribution plans are at the discretion of the Board of Directors of Cintas. Future contributions are expected to be $51.7 million in the next year, $111.2 million in the next two to three years, and $122.6 million in the next four to five years. Cintas may make payments to defined benefit plans to satisfy minimum funding requirements. Currently, Cintas does not expect to make any such payments during the next five years. (1) See Note 6 entitled Debt and Derivatives of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for a detailed presentation of Cintas' debt.(2) Operating leases consist primarily of operational facility leases.(3) Interest payments include interest on both fixed and variable rate debt. As of May 31, 2017, Cintas had approximately $300.5 million of variable rate debt outstanding, which consisted of $50.5 million of commercial paper and a $250.0 million term loan. The interest payments for variable rate debt were estimated using forecasted rates in future years.23Other Commitments Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period(In thousands)Total One yearor less Two tothree years Four tofive years After fiveYears Lines of credit (1)$549,399 $— $549,399 $— $—Standby letters of credit and surety bonds (2)110,893 110,893 — — —Total other commitments$660,292 $110,893 $549,399 $— $—(1) Back-up facility for the commercial paper program (reference Note 6 entitled Debt and Derivatives of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for further discussion).(2) These standby letters of credit support certain outstanding debt (reference Note 6 entitled Debt and Derivatives of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements""), self-insured workers' compensation and general liability insurance programs.Inflation and Changing PricesChanges in wages, benefits and energy costs have the potential to materially impact Cintas' consolidated financial results. Management believes inflation has not had a material impact on Cintas' consolidated financial condition or a negative impact on consolidated results of operations.Litigation and Other ContingenciesCintas is subject to legal proceedings, insurance receipts, legal settlements and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary course of business actions will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows of Cintas. New Accounting StandardsIn April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2014-08, “Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity,” which amended accounting guidance related to the reporting of discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity. The amended guidance changes the thresholds for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations and requires additional disclosures. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014 and is required to be applied prospectively. Cintas adopted ASU 2014-08 during the quarter ended August 31, 2015 and applied the amended accounting guidance to Shred-it and will apply it to future transactions, as appropriate.In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),"" to clarify revenue recognition principles. This guidance is intended to improve disclosure requirements and enhance the comparability of revenue recognition practices. Improved disclosures under the amended guidance relate to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized from contracts with customers. This guidance will be effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and will be required to be applied retrospectively. Early application of the amendments in this update is not permitted. A cross-functional implementation team has been established consisting of representatives from all of our operating segments. The implementation team is working to analyze the impact of the standard on the Cintas' contract portfolio by reviewing current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that would result from applying the requirements of the new standard to revenue contracts. In addition, we are in the process of identifying and implementing the appropriate changes to business processes and controls to support recognition and disclosure under the new standard. Cintas plans to adopt the standard as of the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 using the modified retrospective approach and will record a cumulative adjustment to equity for open contracts as of June 1, 2018. Cintas is continuing to evaluate the impact of ASU 2014-09 and an estimate of the impact to the consolidated financial statements cannot be made at this time.In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, “Balance Sheet Classifications of Deferred Taxes,” which amended accounting guidance related to the presentation of deferred tax liabilities and assets. The amended guidance requires that all deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016; however, early adoption is permitted. This guidance can also be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. Cintas adopted ASU 2015-17 during the quarter ended November 30, 2015 and has applied this amended accounting guidance to its deferred tax liabilities and assets for all periods presented. 24In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, ""Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30), Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs."" ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the consolidated condensed balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The guidance is applied retrospectively and early adoption is permitted. Cintas adopted ASU 2015-03 during the quarter ended August 31, 2016 and has applied this amended accounting guidance to its long-term debt and other assets for all periods presented. The impact of this change in accounting principle on balances previously reported as of May 31, 2016 was a reclassification of $5.6 million from other assets to debt due after one year within long-term liabilities. In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, “Business Combinations (Topic 805), Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.” This amendment eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. This amendment became effective for Cintas beginning June 1, 2016, and was adopted prospectively in accordance with the standard. The adoption of this amendment did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017.In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. Topic 842 supersedes the previous leases standard, ASC 840, Leases. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018; however, early adoption is permitted. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. Cintas is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements.In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, ""Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting."" ASU 2016-09 is intended to simplify accounting for share-based payments. Upon adoption, ASU 2016-09 requires that excess tax benefits for share-based payments be recorded as a reduction of income tax expense and reflected within operating cash flows rather than being recorded within equity and reflected within financing cash flows. The standard also permits the repurchase of more of an employee’s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting, clarifies that all cash payments made on an employee’s behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on our cash flows statement, and provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. This update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016; however, early adoption is permitted. Cintas adopted ASU 2016-09 during the quarter ended August 31, 2016 and elected to make an accounting policy change to recognize forfeitures as they occur. The adoption impact on the consolidated balance sheet was a cumulative-effect adjustment of $26.7 million, increasing opening retained earnings and decreasing paid-in capital. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, “Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Costs.” ASU 2017-07 continues to require the service component of pension and other postretirement benefit costs to be presented in the same line item as other employee compensation costs on the consolidated statement of income and changes the presentation of other components of net benefit cost so that these items will be presented outside of operating income within the consolidated statements of income. Cintas plans to adopt ASU 2017-07 in fiscal 2018 and apply it prospectively. Cintas does not expect the adoption of ASU 2017-07 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.No other new accounting pronouncement recently issued or newly effective had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.25Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of Cintas' consolidated financial statements in conformity with U. S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with Note 1 entitled Significant Accounting Policies of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."" Significant changes, estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.Revenue recognitionRental revenue, which is recorded in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, is recognized when services are performed. Other revenue, which is recorded in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segments and All Other, is recognized when either services are performed or when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer. InventoriesInventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. Cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual and standard costs to the inventory balances. The judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventories at the lower of cost or market. An inventory obsolescence reserve is determined by specific identification, as well as an estimate based on the Company's historical rates of obsolescence.Uniforms and other rental items in serviceUniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization, calculated using the straight-line method. Uniforms in service (other than cleanroom and flame resistant clothing) are amortized over their useful life of 18 months. Uniforms acquired in the G&K acquisition will be amortized over 12 months. Other rental items, including shop towels, mats, mops, cleanroom garments, flame resistant clothing, linens and restroom dispensers, are amortized over their useful lives, which range from 8 to 60 months. The amortization rates used are based on industry experience, Cintas' specific experience and wear tests performed by Cintas. These factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory and related cost of uniforms and ancillary products that are presented in the consolidated financial statements.Property and equipmentDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets based on industry and Cintas specific experience, which is typically 30 to 40 years for buildings, 5 to 20 years for building improvements, 3 to 10 years for equipment and 2 to 15 years for leasehold improvements. When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the carrying amount of the assets. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss is recorded based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is generally determined by discounted cash flows or based on prices of similar assets, as appropriate. As a result of the identification of certain G&K plants and branches for future closure, an indicator of potential impairment was identified. Cintas recognized an impairment loss of $23.3 million during the year ended May 31, 2017, based on the excess of the carrying amount of asset over their respective fair values. The undiscounted cash flows were estimated, using Level 2 inputs based on both the cost and market approaches, at the lowest discernible level, which is at the location level. Cintas did not identify any indicators of impairment for the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015. GoodwillGoodwill, obtained through acquisitions of businesses, is valued at cost less any impairment. Cintas completes an annual impairment test, which may include an assessment of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance. The test may also include the determination of the estimated fair value of Cintas' reporting units via comparisons to current market values, where available, and discounted cash flow analyses. Significant assumptions may include growth rates based on historical trends and margin improvement leveraged from such growth, as well as discount rates. We determine discount rates separately for each reporting unit using the weighted average cost of capital, which includes a calculation of cost of equity, which is developed using the capital asset pricing model and comparable company betas (a measure of systemic risk), and cost of debt. We also use comparable market earnings 26multiple data and our market capitalization to corroborate our reporting unit valuations. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. As a result of Cintas’ operating segment realignment in fiscal 2016 and the acquisition of G&K in fiscal 2017, the composition of Cintas’ reporting units for the evaluation of goodwill impairment has changed. Cintas has identified six reporting units for purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment: Uniform Rental and Facility Services, G&K Services Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services, and three reporting units within All Other. Given the proximity of the G&K acquisition date to the consolidated balance sheet date, the Company performed a high level qualitative analysis for its G&K reporting unit, which considered indicators of impairment to evaluate whether the fair value was more-likely-than-not in excess of its carrying value. The key indicators considered include macroeconomic conditions, industry/market considerations, financial performance, cash flow, changes in management, and composition of net assets. Based on the results of the annual impairment tests, Cintas was not required to recognize an impairment of goodwill for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015. Cintas will continue to perform impairment tests as of March 1 in future years and when indicators of impairment exist.Service contracts and other assetsService contracts and other assets, which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses, are amortized by use of the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the agreements, which are generally 5 to 10 years. The G&K service contract asset will be amortized over a period of 15 years, which represents the estimated life of the economic benefit and the asset amortization is based on the annual economic value of the underlying asset which generally decreases over the 15-year term. Certain noncompete agreements, as well as all service contracts, require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model. The assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates, among other factors. Because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets, actual results over time could vary from original estimates. Impairment of service contracts and other assets is accomplished through specific identification. No impairment has been recognized by Cintas for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.Business Combinations Accounting for acquisitions requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income. See Note 9 entitled Acquisitions and Divestitures of the ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for a discussion of the G&K and ZEE Acquisitions.General insurance liabilities General insurance liabilities represent the estimated ultimate cost of all asserted and unasserted claims incurred, primarily related to worker's compensation, auto liability and other general liability exposure through the consolidated balance sheet dates. Our reserves are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for specific expectations based on our claims history. Cintas records an increase or decrease in selling and administrative expenses related to development of prior claims, higher claims activity and other environmental factors in the period in which it becomes known. These changes in estimates may be material to the consolidated financial statements.Stock-based compensationCompensation expense is recognized for all share-based payments to employees, including stock options and restricted stock awards, in the consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of the awards that are granted. The fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Measured compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the related share-based compensation award. See Note 12 entitled Stock-Based Compensation of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for further information.27Litigation and other contingenciesCintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. U.S. GAAP requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. While a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities, Cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements.Income taxesDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. See Note 8 entitled Income Taxes of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes. Cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets, as adjusted for valuation allowances, will be realized. Accounting for uncertain tax positions requires the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Companies may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.Cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions, Cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate. Based on Cintas' evaluation of current tax positions, Cintas believes its tax related accruals are appropriate.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskEarnings are affected by changes in short-term interest rates due to investments in marketable securities and money market accounts and periodic issuances of commercial paper. If short-term rates changed by one-half percent (or 50 basis points), Cintas' income before income taxes would change by approximately $1.1 million. This estimated exposure considers the effects on investments. This analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in Cintas' capital structure.Through its foreign operations, Cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk. Foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into U.S. dollars. Foreign denominated revenue and profit represents less than 10% of Cintas' consolidated revenue and profit. Cintas periodically uses foreign currency hedges such as average rate options and forward contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements resulting from foreign currency revenue and from international cash flows. The primary foreign currency to which Cintas is exposed is the Canadian dollar.28",2023-12-30 21:41:58.165635

Finally, we evaluate strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise.Results of OperationsOn March 21, 2017, Cintas completed the acquisition of G&K for consideration of approximately $2.1 billion. G&K is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cintas that operates within the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment. To finance the G&K acquisition, Cintas used a combination of new senior notes, a term loan, other borrowings under its existing credit facility and cash on hand. G&K's results of operations are included in Cintas' consolidated financial statements as of and from the date of acquisition. Cintas’ reportable operating segments are Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing, mats, mops and shop towels and other ancillary items. In addition to these rental items, restroom cleaning services and supplies, carpet and tile cleaning services and the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route are included within this reportable operating segment. The First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment consists of first aid and safety products and services. The remainder of Cintas’ business, which consists of Fire Protection Services and its Uniform Direct Sale business, is included in All Other. Cintas evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and income before income taxes. Revenue and income before income taxes for each of these reportable operating segments for the years ended May 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are presented in Note 14 entitled Operating Segment Information of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."" The Company regularly reviews its operating segments for reporting purposes based on the information its chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance and makes changes when appropriate.15In fiscal 2018, Cintas sold a significant business referred to as Discontinued Services. Prior to the sale, Discontinued Services was primarily included in All Other and classified as held for sale. In fiscal 2014, Cintas completed its partnership transaction with the shareholders of Shred-it International Inc. to combine Shredding with the shredding business of Shred-it International Inc. Pursuant to the Shredding Transaction, the Shred-it Partnership was owned 42% by Cintas and 58% by the shareholders of Shred-it International Inc. Cintas' investment in Shred-it and the results of Shredding are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented as a result of selling the investment during fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2015, Cintas sold Storage and, as a result, its operations are also classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets and discontinued operations, the results of Discontinued Services, Shredding and Storage have been excluded from both continuing operations and operating segment results for all periods presented. Please see Note 16 entitled Discontinued Operations of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for additional information.The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percent of revenue by reportable operating segment, All Other and in total for the fiscal years ended May 31: 2018 2017 2016 Revenue: Uniform Rental and Facility Services81.0% 79.0% 78.4%First Aid and Safety Services8.7% 9.5% 9.6%All Other10.3% 11.5% 12.0%Total revenue100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of sales: Uniform Rental and Facility Services55.0% 54.9% 55.7%First Aid and Safety Services52.9% 54.7% 57.3%All Other57.5% 58.3% 58.6%Total cost of sales55.1% 55.3% 56.2% Gross margin: Uniform Rental and Facility Services45.0% 45.1% 44.3%First Aid and Safety Services47.1% 45.3% 42.7%All Other42.5% 41.7% 41.4%Total gross margin44.9% 44.7% 43.8% Selling and administrative expenses: Uniform Rental and Facility Services28.6% 27.1% 26.5%First Aid and Safety Services33.7% 34.9% 31.9%All Other33.9% 34.5% 33.1%Total selling and administrative expenses29.6% 28.7% 27.8% G&K Services, Inc. transaction and integration expenses0.6% 1.5% —% Interest expense, net1.7% 1.6% 1.3% Income from continuing operations before income taxes13.0%12.9%14.7%16Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2018 total revenue was $6.5 billion, an increase of 21.7% over the prior fiscal year. Revenue increased organically by 7.1% as a result of increased sales volume. Organic growth adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, workday differences and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Total revenue was positively impacted by 14.3% due to acquisitions, primarily G&K. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 0.3% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Organic growth by quarter is shown in the table below. Organic Growth First Quarter Ended August 31, 20178.3%Second Quarter Ended November 30, 20177.7%Third Quarter Ended February 28, 20187.8%Fourth Quarter Ended May 31, 20185.1% For the Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 20187.1%Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue consists predominantly of revenue derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms and other garments, including flame resistant clothing, and the rental and/or sale of mats, mops, shop towels, restroom supplies and other rental services. Revenue from the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment increased 24.9% compared to fiscal 2017. Revenue was positively impacted by 17.9% due to acquisitions, primarily G&K. The remaining increase primarily resulted from an organic growth increase in revenue of 6.7%. The amount of new business grew, resulting from an increase in the number and productivity of sales representatives. Generally, sales productivity improvements are the result of increased tenure and improved training, which result in a higher number of products and services sold. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 0.3% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.Other revenue, consisting of revenue from the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other, increased 9.7% compared to fiscal 2017. Revenue increased organically by 8.6% due primarily to improved sales representative productivity. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 0.1% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Acquisitions positively impacted revenue by 1.0%.Cost of uniform rental and facility services increased 25.1% compared to fiscal 2017. Cost of uniform rental and facility services consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory, including uniforms, mats, shop towels and other ancillary items. The cost of uniform rental and facility services increase compared to fiscal 2017 was due to increased Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment sales volume from organic growth and the acquired G&K sales volume.Cost of other consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly first aid and safety products, uniforms and fire protection products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other. Cost of other increased 7.2% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily related to the increased sales volumes in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other.Selling and administrative expenses increased $389.4 million, or 25.5%, compared to fiscal 2017 due primarily to a one-time cash payment to employee-partners, increased labor and other employee-partner related expenses as a result of the acquisition of G&K, increased amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired as a result of the G&K acquisition and increased costs related to investments in a new enterprise resource planning system. The one-time cash payment to employee-partners was made following the enactment of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) which was signed into legislation by the President on December 22, 2017. The one-time cash payment to employee-partners amounted to an expense of approximately $40 million, or 0.6% of total revenue. Operating income for fiscal 2018 was negatively impacted by $41.9 million, or 0.6% of total revenue, from transaction and integration expenses incurred in connection with the G&K acquisition and $79.2 million, or 1.5% of total revenue, in fiscal 2017. Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) was $108.8 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $86.3 million in fiscal 2017. The increase in net interest expense is primarily due to the additional debt issued to finance the G&K acquisition. 17Income before income taxes was $841.0 million, an increase of $153.6 million, or 22.3%, compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in income before income taxes was primarily due to revenue growing at a faster pace than expenses. Cintas' effective tax rate on continuing operations was 6.8% for fiscal 2018 compared to 33.5% in fiscal 2017. The decrease was due to the impact of the Tax Act. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 was impacted by certain discrete items (primarily the tax accounting for stock-based compensation).Net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2018 of $783.9 million was a 71.4% increase compared to fiscal 2017. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $7.03 was a 68.6% increase compared to fiscal 2017. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased primarily due to the lower effective tax rate as a result of the Tax Act, the gain on the sale of Discontinued Services and higher gross margin. Uniform Rental and Facility Services Reportable Operating SegmentUniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue increased $1,044.6 million, or 24.9%, and the cost of uniform rental and facility services increased $579.2 million, or 25.1%, as previously discussed. The reportable operating segment's fiscal 2018 gross margin was 45.0% of revenue compared to 45.1% in fiscal 2017. The slight decrease in gross margin was driven by the G&K acquisition, which had lower margins than the legacy Cintas margins. In addition, we incurred expected integration inefficiencies which impacted margins in the short-term. Selling and administrative expenses for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment increased $362.3 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. Selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue for fiscal 2018 was 28.6% compared to 27.1% in fiscal 2017. The increase in selling and administrative expenses for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment was primarily related to a one-time cash payment to employee-partners, increased labor and employee-partner related expenses as a result of the G&K acquisition, increased amortization expense related to intangibles acquired as a result of the G&K acquisition and an investment in an enterprise resource planning system. As a result of the G&K acquisition, the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment incurred $41.9 million of transaction and integration expenses directly related to the acquisition. The expenses incurred in fiscal 2018 consisted of lease cancellation costs, facility closure expenses and other integration related expenses. Income before income taxes increased $140.5 million to $817.6 million for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. Income before income taxes as a percent of revenue at 15.6% decreased 50 basis points from 16.1% in fiscal 2017. The decrease is primarily due to the increase in selling and administrative expenses as previously discussed. First Aid and Safety Services Reportable Operating SegmentFirst Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment revenue increased $56.5 million in fiscal 2018, an 11.1% increase compared to fiscal 2017. Revenue increased organically by 10.5% as a result of increased sales volume. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 0.5% due to acquisitions. Cost of first aid and safety services increased $20.9 million, or 7.5%, in fiscal 2018, due primarily to higher sales volume. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment is defined as revenue less cost of goods, warehouse expenses, service expenses and training expenses. The gross margin as a percent of revenue was 47.1% for fiscal 2018 compared to 45.3% in fiscal 2017. The increase was driven primarily by improved sourcing, leveraging of existing warehouses and optimization of delivery routes. Selling and administrative expenses for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment increased by $13.2 million, or 7.4%, in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was due primarily to increased labor, including a one-time cash payment to employee-partners. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were 33.7% in fiscal 2018 compared to 34.9% in fiscal 2017. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue was due to revenue growing at a faster pace than labor and employee-partner related expenses. Income before income taxes was $75.2 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of $22.4 million, or 42.5%, compared to fiscal 2017. Income before income taxes as a percent of revenue at 13.3%, increased from 10.4% in fiscal 2017 due to the previously discussed growth in revenue, improvement in the gross margin percentage and improvement in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue. 18Fiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2017 total revenue was $5.3 billion, an increase of 11.0% over the prior fiscal year. Revenue increased organically by 6.7% as a result of increased sales volume. Organic growth adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, workday differences and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Total revenue was positively impacted by 4.8% due to acquisitions, primarily through the acquisition of G&K. Revenue growth was negatively impacted by 0.1% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and 0.4% due to one less workday in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Organic growth by quarter is shown in the table below. Organic Growth First Quarter Ended August 31, 20166.0%Second Quarter Ended November 30, 20166.0%Third Quarter Ended February 28, 20176.6%Fourth Quarter Ended May 31, 20178.1% For the Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 20176.7%Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue consists predominantly of revenue derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms and other garments, including flame resistant clothing, and the rental and/or sale of mats, mops, shop towels, restroom supplies and other rental services. Revenue from the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment increased 11.8% compared to fiscal 2016. The increase resulted from an organic growth increase in revenue of 6.9%. The amount of new business grew, resulting from an increase in the number and productivity of sales representatives. Generally, sales productivity improvements are the result of increased tenure and improved training, which result in a higher number of products and services sold. Revenue growth was negatively impacted by 0.1% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and 0.4% due to one less workday in fiscal 2017 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Revenue was positively impacted by 5.4% due to acquisitions, primarily G&K. Other revenue, consisting of revenue from the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other, increased 8.2% compared to fiscal 2016. Revenue increased organically by 6.1% due primarily to improved sales representative productivity. Revenue growth was negatively impacted by 0.1% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and 0.4% due to one less workday in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Acquisitions positively impacted revenue by 2.6%.Cost of uniform rental and facility services increased 10.3% compared to fiscal 2016. Cost of uniform rental and facility services consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory, including uniforms, mats, shop towels and other ancillary items. The cost of uniform rental and facility services increase compared to fiscal 2016 was due to increased Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment sales volume from internal growth and the acquired G&K sales volume.Cost of other consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly first aid and safety products, uniforms and fire protection products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other. Cost of other increased 5.6% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily related to the increased sales volumes in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other.Selling and administrative expenses increased $195.0 million, or 14.6%, compared to fiscal 2016 due primarily to increases in labor and other employee-partner related expenses. As a result of the acquisition of G&K in fiscal 2017, the Company incurred various transaction and integration expenses, which related primarily to asset impairment charges, legal and professional fees, employee termination expenses, the write-off of excess inventory and other miscellaneous expenses. In fiscal 2017, G&K transaction and integration expenses were $79.2 million or 1.5% of total revenue. Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) was $86.3 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $63.6 million in fiscal 2016. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to the additional debt issued to finance the G&K acquisition and $17.1 million of short-term debt financing fees incurred in connection with the acquisition. 19Income before income taxes was $687.4 million, a decrease of $17.9 million, or 2.5%, compared to fiscal 2016. The decrease in income before income taxes was due to the G&K transaction and integration expenses and the increase in interest expense previously mentioned. These impacts were partially offset by the increase in gross margin. Cintas' effective tax rate on continuing operations was 33.5% for fiscal 2017 compared to 36.4% in fiscal 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the adoption of Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2016-09, ""Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting."" The effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 included a benefit of $29.4 million as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09. This benefit was partially offset by the election to recognize forfeitures as they occur, which resulted in additional stock compensation expense of $8.3 million when compared to our historical practice of estimating forfeiture for expense purposes. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 also resulted in an increase in the effect of dilutive securities in fiscal 2017 of 0.8 million shares. For fiscal 2017, the net impact on diluted earnings per share from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 was an increase of $0.19 per share over what diluted earnings per share would have been if ASU 2016-09 was not adopted in fiscal 2017. Net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2017 of $457.3 million was a 1.9% increase compared to fiscal 2016. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.17 was a 3.7% increase compared to fiscal 2016. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased due to the lower effective tax rate combined with the decrease in weighted average common shares outstanding. The decrease in weighted average common shares outstanding resulted from purchasing 8.8 million shares of common stock under the January 13, 2015 and August 4, 2015 share buyback programs since the beginning of fiscal 2016. Uniform Rental and Facility Services Reportable Operating SegmentUniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue increased $443.0 million, or 11.8%, and the cost of uniform rental and facility services increased $214.9 million, or 10.3%, as previously discussed. The reportable operating segment's fiscal 2017 gross margin was 45.1% of revenue compared to 44.3% in fiscal 2016. The 80 basis point improvement was driven by many factors, including new business sold by sales representatives, penetration of additional products and services into existing customers and continuously improving the efficiency of internal processes. Selling and administrative expenses for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment increased $143.8 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue for fiscal 2017 was 27.1% compared to 26.5% in fiscal 2016. The increase in selling and administrative expenses for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment was primarily related to the G&K acquisition.As a result of the G&K acquisition, the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment incurred $79.2 million of transaction and integration expenses. These expenses consisted of the following: asset impairment charges of $23.3 million, legal and professional fees directly related to the acquisition of $17.4 million, employee termination expenses recognized under Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 712, ""Compensation - Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits"" of $31.0 million, write-off of excess inventory of $5.5 million and $2.0 million of other miscellaneous integration expenses. Income before income taxes increased $5.0 million to $677.1 million for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Income before income taxes as a percent of revenue at 16.1%, decreased 180 basis points from 17.9% in fiscal 2016. The decrease is primarily due to the G&K transaction and integration expenses mentioned above. First Aid and Safety Services Reportable Operating SegmentFirst Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment revenue increased $46.5 million in fiscal 2017, a 10.1% increase compared to fiscal 2016. Revenue increased organically by 5.9% as a result of increased sales volume. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 4.6% due to acquisitions. One less workday in fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year negatively impacted growth by 0.4%. Cost of first aid and safety services increased $13.3 million, or 5.0%, in fiscal 2017, due primarily to increased First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment volume. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment is defined as revenue less cost of goods, warehouse expenses, service expenses and training expenses. The gross margin as a percent of revenue was 45.3% for fiscal 2017 compared to 42.7% in fiscal 2016. The increase in gross margin was due to the benefits realized as a result of the integration of ZEE Medical Inc. (ZEE). These benefits included improved delivery efficiencies and improved sourcing of goods.20Selling and administrative expenses for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment increased by $29.9 million, or 20.3%, in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were 34.9% in fiscal 2017 compared to 31.9% in fiscal 2016. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily the result of the investment in selling resources to grow the acquired ZEE customer base and increases in various employee-partner related expenses. Income before income taxes was $52.8 million in fiscal 2017, an increase of $3.3 million, or 6.6%, compared to fiscal 2016. Income before income taxes as a percent of revenue at 10.4%, decreased from 10.7% in fiscal 2016, due primarily to the investment in selling resources mentioned above.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe following is a summary of our cash flows and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of and for the fiscal years ending May 31:(In thousands)2018 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities$964,160 $763,887Net cash used in investing activities$(135,698) $(2,310,349)Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities$(864,140) $1,578,502 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period$138,724 $169,266Marketable securities at the end of the period$— $22,219Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of May 31, 2018 and 2017 include $33.9 million and $125.5 million, respectively, that is located outside of the United States. Cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. We generally use these cash flows to fund most, if not all, of our operations and dividends on our common stock. We may also use cash flows provided by operating activities, as well as proceeds from long-term debt and short-term borrowings, to fund growth and expansion opportunities, as well as other cash requirements such as the repurchase of our common stock.Net cash provided by operating activities was $964.2 million for fiscal 2018, which was an increase of $200.3 million compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was the result of higher net income offset by the $96.4 million gain on the sale of Discontinued Services, changes in deferred taxes as a result of the Tax Act and changes in working capital.Net cash used in investing activities was $135.7 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $2,310.3 million in fiscal 2017. Capital expenditures were $271.7 million and $273.3 million for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 included $225.7 million for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment and $27.9 million for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment. Cash paid for acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, was $19.3 million and $2,102.4 million for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. The acquisitions in both fiscal 2018 and 2017 occurred in our Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, which included G&K in fiscal 2017, our First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and our Fire Protection business, which is included in All Other. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 included proceeds of $127.8 million related to the sale of Discontinued Services and $28.3 million related to the Storage and Shredding transactions. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2018 and 2017 also included net proceeds of $26.1 million and $37.3 million, respectively, from purchases and redemptions of marketable securities and investments. Net cash used in financing activities was $864.1 million for fiscal 2018, compared to $1,578.5 million of net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2017. The decrease in fiscal 2018 from fiscal 2017 is primarily due to the net payment of $600.5 million of debt compared to a net issuance of $1,732.7 million of debt in fiscal 2017. To finance the G&K acquisition in fiscal 2017, Cintas issued various forms of debt, totaling $2,091.2 million, net. 21On August 2, 2016, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $500.0 million share buyback program, which does not have an expiration date. During fiscal 2018, under the August 2, 2016 share buyback program, we purchased 0.5 million shares at an average price of $173.51 per share for a total purchase price of $90.0 million. During fiscal 2017, we purchased 0.1 million shares at an average price of $94.09 per share for a total purchase price of $3.7 million under a previously authorized share buyback program. Subsequent to May 31, 2018 through July 27, 2018, Cintas purchased 0.3 million shares at an average price of $199.15 per share for a total purchase price of $60.0 million. Under the August 2, 2016 program through July 27, 2018, Cintas has purchased a total of 0.8 million shares of Cintas common stock at an average price of $182.93 per share for a total purchase price of $150.0 million. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018, Cintas acquired 0.3 million shares of Cintas common stock in satisfaction of employee payroll taxes due on restricted stock awards that vested during the fiscal year. These shares were acquired at an average price of $130.30 per share for a total purchase price of $37.3 million.On October 17, 2017, Cintas declared an annual cash dividend of $1.62 per share on outstanding common stock, a21.8% increase over the annual dividend paid in the prior year. The dividend was paid on December 8, 2017 to shareholders of record as of November 10, 2017. This marked the 35th consecutive year that Cintas has increased its annual dividend, every year since going public in 1983.On March 21, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of G&K. To finance the G&K acquisition, Cintas used a combination of new senior notes, a term loan, other borrowings under its existing credit facility and cash on hand. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018, Cintas paid a net total of $50.5 million of commercial paper and paid off the term loan balance of $250.0 million with cash on hand. On December 1, 2017, Cintas paid the $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.13% 10-year senior notes that matured on that date with cash on hand and $265.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. On June 1, 2016, Cintas paid the $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of five-year senior notes that matured on that date with cash on hand and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper.The following table summarizes Cintas' outstanding debt at May 31:(In thousands)Interest Rate Fiscal YearIssued Fiscal YearMaturity 2018 2017 Debt due within one year Senior notes6.13% 2008 2018 $— $300,000Commercial paper1.24%(1) Various Various — 50,500Current portion of term loan2.00%(1) 2017 2018 — 12,500Debt issuance costs — (100)Total debt due within one year $— $362,900 Debt due after one year Senior notes4.30% 2012 2022 $250,000 $250,000Senior notes2.90% 2017 2022 650,000 650,000Senior notes3.25% 2013 2023 300,000 300,000Senior notes (2)2.78% 2013 2023 52,119 52,554Senior notes (3)3.11% 2015 2025 52,309 52,645Senior notes3.70% 2017 2027 1,000,000 1,000,000Senior notes6.15% 2007 2037 250,000 250,000Long-term portion of term loan2.00%(1) 2017 2022 — 237,500Debt issuance costs (19,119) (22,075) Total debt due after one year $2,535,309 $2,770,624(1) Variable rate debt instrument.

The interest rate shown above is the effective interest rate. The principal amount of these notes is $50.0 million with a stated interest rate of 3.73%. (3) Cintas assumed these senior notes with the acquisition of G&K, and they were recorded at fair value. The interest rate shown above is the effective interest rate. The principal amount of these notes is $50.0 million with a stated interest rate of 3.88%. 22The credit agreement that supports our commercial paper program was amended on September 16, 2016. The amendment increased the capacity of the revolving credit facility from $450.0 million to $600.0 million and added a $250.0 million term loan facility. The existing term loan facility was paid in full during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The credit agreement has an accordion feature that provides Cintas the ability to request increases to the borrowing commitments under either the revolving credit facility or the term loan of up to $250.0 million in the aggregate, subject to customary conditions. The maturity date of the agreement is September 15, 2021. No commercial paper or borrowings on our revolving credit facility were outstanding at May 31, 2018. As of May 31, 2017, there was $50.5 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 1.24% and maturity dates less than 30 days and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements. These covenants limit Cintas' ability to incur certain liens, to engage in sale-leaseback transactions and to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of Cintas' assets. These covenants also require Cintas to maintain certain debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and interest coverage ratios. Cross-default provisions exist between certain debt instruments. If a default of a significant covenant were to occur, the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness, impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital. Cintas was in compliance with all of the debt covenants for all periods presented. Our access to the commercial paper and long-term debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity. We do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past. Our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend, to a significant degree, on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness. As of May 31, 2018, our ratings were as follows:Rating Agency Outlook Commercial Paper Long-term Debt Standard & Poor’s Stable A-2 BBB+Moody’s Investors Service Stable P-2 A3 On June 11, 2018, Standard & Poor's rating agency updated their ratings as follows: Rating Agency Outlook Commercial Paper Long-term Debt Standard & Poor’s Positive A-2 BBB+In the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding long-term debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason, or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of long-term debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above, particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings, our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected. In addition, in such a case, our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and long-term debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies. To monitor our credit rating and our capacity for long-term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. One such factor is the ratio of our total debt to EBITDA. For the purpose of this calculation, debt is defined as the sum of short-term borrowings, long-term debt due within one year, obligations under capital leases due in one year, long-term debt and long-term obligations under capital leases. On December 22, 2017, the United States adopted tax reform legislation commonly known as the Tax Act, which is generally effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Act includes a number of changes to U.S. tax law, including lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to 21% and changing or limiting certain tax deductions. In addition, the Tax Act alters the landscape of taxation of non-U.S. operations and provides immediate deductions for certain new investments, among other provisions.23Cintas has reasonably estimated the effects of the Tax Act to be a net income tax benefit of $161.4 million for fiscal 2018. The significant components of this income tax benefit include (i) the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities at the lower enacted U.S. corporate tax rate, which resulted in a net $175.6 million decrease in income tax expense; (ii) a $4.4 million net tax expense comprised of foreign withholding taxes related to certain non-U.S. earnings subject to repatriation; and (iii) $9.8 million in transition tax related to certain non-U.S. earnings subject to repatriation that were previously tax deferred.The overall net impact of the Tax Act resulted in a net decrease in Cintas’ effective tax rates in fiscal 2018, and we anticipate the net impact of the Tax Act on future periods to also be a net decrease in our effective tax rates. While the reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21% in fiscal 2018 and beyond will result in lower income tax expense, other elements of the Tax Act will partially offset this reduction. Elements of the Tax Act that will cause an increase in future income tax expense include:• The Tax Act expands the limitation on the deduction of certain executive compensation. This expansion is subject to transition rules that provide relief for previously awarded compensation. We estimate that this deduction limitation will adversely impact our effective rate in future periods.• The Tax Act limits certain entertainment deductions.• The Tax Act eliminates the Section 199 deduction.The estimated impacts of the Tax Act recorded during fiscal 2018 as well as the forward-looking estimates are provisional in nature, and Cintas will continue to assess the impact of the Tax Act and provide additional information and record adjustments through the income tax provision in the relevant period as amounts are known and reasonably estimable during the measurement period. Accordingly, the impact of the Tax Act may differ from our provisional estimates due to, among other factors, information currently not available, changes in interpretations and the issuance of additional guidance, as well as changes in assumptions Cintas has made, including actions Cintas may take in fiscal 2019 as a result of the Tax Act.Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period(In thousands)Total One yearor less Two tothree years Four tofive years After fiveyears Debt (1)$2,550,000 $— $— $1,250,000 $1,300,000Operating leases (2)196,774 49,313 75,336 44,409 27,716Interest payments (3)797,243 95,530 191,060 151,210 359,443Unconditional purchase obligations— — — — —Total contractual cash obligations$3,544,017 $144,843 $266,396 $1,445,619 $1,687,159(1) See Note 6 entitled Debt and Derivatives of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for a detailed presentation of Cintas' debt.(2) Operating leases consist primarily of operational facility leases.(3) Interest payments could include interest on both fixed and variable rate debt. As of May 31, 2018, Cintas did not have commercial paper outstanding, and therefore did not have any variable rate debt. Cintas also makes payments to defined contribution plans and may make payments to defined benefit plans to satisfy minimum funding requirements. The amount of contributions made to the defined contribution plans are at the discretion of the Board of Directors of Cintas. Future contributions to the defined contribution plans are expected to be $62.5 million in the next year, $134.5 million in the next two to three years and $148.3 million in the next four to five years. Future contributions to the defined benefit plans are expected to be $4.3 million in the next year, $5.6 million in the next two to three years and $5.6 million in the next four to five years. 24Other Commitments Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period(In thousands)Total One yearor less Two tothree years Four tofive years After fiveyears Lines of credit (1)$599,876 $— $— $599,876 $—Standby letters of credit and surety bonds (2)143,035 143,035 — — —Total other commitments$742,911 $143,035 $— $599,876 $—(1) Back-up facility for the commercial paper program (reference Note 6 entitled Debt and Derivatives of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for further discussion).(2) These standby letters of credit and surety bonds support certain outstanding debt (reference Note 6 entitled Debt and Derivatives of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements""), self-insured workers' compensation and general liability insurance programs.Inflation and Changing PricesChanges in wages, benefits and energy costs have the potential to materially impact Cintas' consolidated financial results. Management believes inflation has not had a material impact on Cintas' consolidated financial condition or a negative impact on consolidated results of operations.Litigation and Other ContingenciesCintas is subject to legal proceedings, insurance receipts, legal settlements and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary course of business actions will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows of Cintas. New Accounting StandardsIn April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-08, “Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity,” which amended accounting guidance related to the reporting of discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity. The amended guidance changes the thresholds for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations and requires additional disclosures. Cintas adopted ASU 2014-08 during the quarter ended August 31, 2015 and applied the amended accounting guidance to Shred-it and all subsequent transactions, as appropriate.In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),"" to clarify revenue recognition principles. The standard applies one comprehensive revenue recognition model across all contracts, entities and sectors. The core principal of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard includes cost guidance, whereby all direct and incremental costs to obtain or fulfill a contract will be capitalized and amortized over the corresponding period of benefit, determined on a contract by contract basis. This guidance is also intended to improve disclosure requirements and enhance the comparability of revenue recognition practices. Improved disclosures under the amended guidance relate to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized from contracts with customers. Cintas adopted this standard on June 1, 2018. The largest impacts to the Company’s financial statements will result from the new qualitative and quantitative disclosures that will be required upon adoption of the new standard. There will be two implementation adjustments upon adoption of the new standard related to the capitalization of certain direct and incremental contract costs and the timing of revenue recognition for certain contracts with customers that create an asset with no alternative use to the Company. The Company will apply the modified retrospective adoption alternative for this standard and anticipates recognizing a cumulative effect adjustment in the range of approximately $185.0 million to $215.0 million of an increase to retained earnings as of June 1, 2018, which primarily reflects the deferral of contract costs. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, ""Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30), Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs."" ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the consolidated condensed balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of 25that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The guidance is applied retrospectively and early adoption is permitted. Cintas adopted ASU 2015-03 during the quarter ended August 31, 2016 and has applied this amended accounting guidance to its long-term debt and other assets for all periods presented. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. Topic 842 supersedes the previous leases standard, ASC 840, ""Leases."" This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018; however, early adoption is permitted. Entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements. Cintas is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements. The Company currently expects the adoption of this standard to result in a material increase to the assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, ""Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting."" ASU 2016-09 is intended to simplify accounting for share-based payments. Upon adoption, ASU 2016-09 requires excess tax benefits for share-based payments to be recorded as a reduction of income tax expense and reflected within operating cash flows rather than being recorded within equity and reflected within financing cash flows. The standard also permits the repurchase of more of an employee’s shares for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting, clarifies that all cash payments made on an employee’s behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on our cash flows statement, and provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. This update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016; however, early adoption is permitted. Cintas adopted ASU 2016-09 during the quarter ended August 31, 2016 and elected to make an accounting policy change to recognize forfeitures as they occur. The adoption impact on the consolidated balance sheet was a cumulative-effect adjustment of $26.7 million, increasing opening retained earnings and decreasing paid-in capital. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.” ASU 2017-04 eliminates the two-step process that required identification of potential impairment and a separate measure of the actual impairment. Goodwill impairment charges, if any, would be determined by the difference between a reporting unit's carrying value and its fair value (impairment loss is limited to the carrying value). This standard is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, “Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Costs.” ASU 2017-07 continues to require the service component of pension and other postretirement benefit costs to be presented in the same line item as other employee compensation costs on the consolidated statement of income and changes the presentation of other components of net benefit cost so that these items will be presented outside of operating income within the consolidated statements of income. Cintas retrospectively adopted ASU 2017-07 on June 1, 2017. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, ""Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income."" ASU 2018-02 allows entities to elect to reclassify the income tax effects of the Tax Act on items within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings and requires additional related disclosures. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Cintas is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2018-02 will have on its consolidated condensed financial statements.No other new accounting pronouncement recently issued or newly effective had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.26Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of Cintas' consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with Note 1 entitled Significant Accounting Policies of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."" Significant changes, estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.Revenue recognitionRental revenue, which is recorded in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, is recognized when services are performed. Other revenue, which is recorded in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segments and All Other, is recognized when either services are performed or when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer. InventoriesInventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value. Cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual and standard costs to the inventory balances. The judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. An inventory obsolescence reserve is determined by specific identification, as well as an estimate based on the Company's historical rates of obsolescence.Uniforms and other rental items in serviceUniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization, calculated using the straight-line method. Uniforms in service (other than cleanroom and flame resistant clothing) are amortized over their useful life of 18 months. Uniforms acquired in the G&K acquisition were amortized over 12 months. Other rental items, including shop towels, mats, mops, cleanroom garments, flame resistant clothing, linens and restroom dispensers, are amortized over their useful lives, which range from 8 to 60 months. The amortization rates used are based on industry experience, Cintas' specific experience and wear tests performed by Cintas. These factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory and related cost of uniforms and ancillary products that are presented in the consolidated financial statements.Property and equipmentDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets based on industry and Cintas specific experience, which is typically 30 to 40 years for buildings, 5 to 20 years for building improvements, 3 to 10 years for equipment and 2 to 15 years for leasehold improvements. When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the carrying amount of the assets. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss is recorded based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is generally determined by discounted cash flows or based on prices of similar assets, as appropriate. As a result of the identification of certain G&K plants and branches for future closure, an indicator of potential impairment was identified. Cintas recognized an impairment loss of $23.3 million during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017, based on the excess of the carrying amount of asset over their respective fair values. The undiscounted cash flows were estimated, using Level 2 inputs based on both the cost and market approaches, at the lowest discernible level, which is at the location level. Cintas did not identify any indicators of impairment for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2018 and 2016. GoodwillGoodwill, obtained through acquisitions of businesses, is valued at cost less any impairment. Cintas completes an annual impairment test, which may include an assessment of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance. The test may also include the determination of the estimated fair value of Cintas' reporting units via comparisons to current market values, where available, and discounted cash flow analyses. Significant assumptions may include growth rates based on historical trends and margin improvement leveraged from such growth, as well as discount rates. We determine discount rates separately for each reporting unit using the weighted average cost of capital, which includes a calculation of cost of equity, which is developed using the capital asset pricing model and comparable company betas (a measure of systemic risk), and cost of debt. We also use comparable market earnings 27multiple data and our market capitalization to corroborate our reporting unit valuations. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. Cintas has identified four reporting units for purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment: Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services, and two reporting units within All Other. Based on the results of the annual impairment tests, Cintas was not required to recognize an impairment of goodwill for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. Cintas will continue to perform impairment tests as of March 1 in future years and when indicators of impairment exist.Service contracts and other assetsService contracts and other assets, which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses, are amortized by use of the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the agreements, which are generally 5 to 10 years. The G&K service contract asset is being amortized over a period of 15 years, which represents the estimated life of the economic benefit and the asset amortization is based on the annual economic value of the underlying asset which generally decreases over the 15-year term. Certain noncompete agreements, as well as all service contracts, require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model. The assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates, among other factors. Because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets, actual results over time could vary from original estimates. Impairment of service contracts and other assets is accomplished through specific identification. No impairment has been recognized by Cintas for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016.Business Combinations Accounting for acquisitions requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income. See Note 9 entitled Acquisitions and Divestitures of the ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for a discussion of the G&K acquisition.General insurance liabilities General insurance liabilities represent the estimated ultimate cost of all asserted and unasserted claims incurred, primarily related to worker's compensation, auto liability and other general liability exposure through the consolidated balance sheet dates. Our reserves are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for specific expectations based on our claims history. Cintas records an increase or decrease in selling and administrative expenses related to development of prior claims, higher claims activity and other environmental factors in the period in which it becomes known. These changes in estimates may be material to the consolidated financial statements.Stock-based compensationCompensation expense is recognized for all share-based payments to employees, including stock options and restricted stock awards, in the consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of the awards that are granted. The fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Generally, measured compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the related share-based compensation award. See Note 12 entitled Stock-Based Compensation of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for further information.Litigation and other contingenciesCintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. U.S. GAAP requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. While a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities, Cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements.28Income taxesDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. See Note 8 entitled Income Taxes of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes. Cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets, as adjusted for valuation allowances, will be realized. Accounting for uncertain tax positions requires the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Companies may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.Cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions, Cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate. Based on Cintas' evaluation of current tax positions, Cintas believes its tax related accruals are appropriate.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskEarnings are affected by changes in short-term interest rates due to investments in marketable securities and money market accounts and periodic issuances of commercial paper. If short-term rates changed by one-half percent (or 50 basis points), Cintas' income before income taxes would not be impacted because we had no variable rate debt as of May 31, 2018. This estimated exposure considers the effects on investments. This analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in Cintas' capital structure.Through its foreign operations, Cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk. Foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into U.S. dollars. Foreign denominated revenue and profit represents less than 10% of Cintas' consolidated revenue and profit. Cintas periodically uses foreign currency hedges such as average rate options and forward contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements resulting from foreign currency revenue and from international cash flows. The primary foreign currency to which Cintas is exposed is the Canadian dollar.29",2023-12-30 21:41:56.119601

This strategy is to achieve revenue growth for all our products and services by increasing our penetration at existing customers and by broadening our customer base to include business segments to which we have not historically served. We will also continue to identify additional product and service opportunities for our current and future customers.To pursue the strategy of increasing penetration, we have a highly talented and diverse team of service professionals visiting our customers on a regular basis. This frequent contact with our customers enables us to develop close personal relationships. The combination of our distribution system and these strong customer relationships provides a platform from which we launch additional products and services.We pursue the strategy of broadening our customer base in several ways. Cintas has a national sales organization introducing all our products and services to prospects in all business segments. Our broad range of products and services allows our sales organization to consider any type of business a prospect. We also broaden our customer base through geographic expansion, especially in our first aid and safety and fire protection businesses. Finally, we evaluate strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise.Results of OperationsCintas classifies its business into two reportable operating segments and places the remainder of its operating segments in an All Other category. Cintas’ two reportable operating segments are Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing, mats, mops and shop towels and other ancillary items. In addition to these rental items, restroom cleaning services and supplies, carpet and tile cleaning services and the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route are included within this reportable operating segment. The First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment consists of first aid and safety products and services. The remainder of Cintas’ business, which consists of Fire Protection Services and its Uniform Direct Sale business, is included in All Other. These operating segments consist of fire protection products and services and the direct sale of uniforms and related items. Cintas evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and income before income taxes. Revenue and income before income taxes for each of these reportable operating segments for the years ended May 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are presented in Note 15 entitled Operating Segment Information of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."" The Company regularly reviews its operating segments for reporting purposes based on the information its chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance and makes changes when appropriate.On March 21, 2017, Cintas completed the acquisition of G&K Services, Inc. (G&K). G&K is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cintas that operates within the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment. In fiscal 2018, Cintas sold a significant business referred to as ""Discontinued Services."" Prior to the sale of Discontinued Services, the operations were primarily included in All Other and classified as held for sale. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the disposal of long-lived assets and discontinued operations, the results of Discontinued Services have been excluded from both continuing operations and operating segment results for all periods presented. See Note 17 entitled Discontinued Operations of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for additional information.15In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),"" to clarify revenue recognition principles. This guidance is intended to improve disclosure requirements and enhance the comparability of revenue recognition practices. Cintas adopted this ASU, and all the related amendments, effective June 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. See Note 1 entitled Significant Accounting Policies and Note 2 entitled Revenue Recognition of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for more information.The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percent of revenue by reportable operating segment, All Other and in total for the fiscal years ended May 31: 2019 2018 2017 Revenue: Uniform Rental and Facility Services80.6% 81.0% 79.0%First Aid and Safety Services9.0% 8.7% 9.5%All Other10.4% 10.3% 11.5%Total revenue100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of sales: Uniform Rental and Facility Services54.5% 55.0% 54.9%First Aid and Safety Services52.0% 52.9% 54.7%All Other57.4% 57.5% 58.3%Total cost of sales54.6% 55.1% 55.3% Gross margin: Uniform Rental and Facility Services45.5% 45.0% 45.1%First Aid and Safety Services48.0% 47.1% 45.3%All Other42.6% 42.5% 41.7%Total gross margin45.4% 44.9% 44.7% Selling and administrative expenses: Uniform Rental and Facility Services27.6% 28.6% 27.1%First Aid and Safety Services33.4% 33.7% 34.9%All Other33.3% 33.9% 34.5%Total selling and administrative expenses28.7% 29.6% 28.7% G&K Services, Inc. transaction and integration expenses0.2% 0.6% 1.5% Gain on sale of a cost method investment1.0% —% —% Interest expense, net1.5% 1.7% 1.6% Income from continuing operations before income taxes16.0%13.0%12.9%16Fiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2019 total revenue was $6.9 billion, an increase of 6.4% over the prior fiscal year. Revenue increased organically by 6.5% as a result of increased sales volume. Organic growth adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Total revenue was positively impacted by 0.2% due to acquisitions and negatively impacted by 0.3% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Organic growth by quarter for fiscal 2019 is as follows: Organic Growth First Quarter Ended August 31, 20185.2%Second Quarter Ended November 30, 20187.0%Third Quarter Ended February 28, 20196.0%Fourth Quarter Ended May 31, 20197.6% For the Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 20196.5%Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue consists predominantly of revenue derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms and other garments, including flame resistant clothing, and the rental and/or sale of mats, mops, shop towels, restroom supplies and other rental services. Revenue from the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment increased 5.8% compared to fiscal 2018 due to an organic growth increase of 6.1%. Revenue growth was negatively impacted by 0.3% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Revenue growth was a result of new business, the penetration of additional products and services into existing customers and price increases, partially offset by lost business. New business growth resulted from an increase in the number and productivity of sales representatives. Generally, sales productivity improvements are due to increased tenure and improved training, which produce a higher number of products and services sold. Other revenue, consisting of revenue from the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other, increased 9.0% compared to fiscal 2018. Revenue increased organically by 7.8% primarily due to improved sales representative productivity. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 1.2% due to acquisitions.Cost of uniform rental and facility services increased 4.9% compared to fiscal 2018. Cost of uniform rental and facility services consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory, including uniforms, mats, shop towels and other ancillary items. The cost of uniform rental and facility services increase compared to fiscal 2018 was due to increased Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment sales volume from organic growth.Cost of other consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly first aid and safety products, uniforms and fire protection products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other. Cost of other increased 8.1% in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily related to the increased sales volumes in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other.Selling and administrative expenses increased $63.9 million, or 3.3%, compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to increases in labor and other employee-partner related expenses. Operating income in both fiscal 2019 and 2018 was negatively impacted by $14.4 million and $41.9 million, respectively, of integration expenses incurred in connection with the G&K acquisition. The after-tax effect of these integration expenses represents a negative impact on diluted earnings per share of $0.10 per share in fiscal 2019 and $0.26 per share in fiscal 2018.During fiscal 2019, Cintas sold a cost method investment for $73.3 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $69.4 million. The after-tax effect of the gain represents a positive impact on diluted earnings per share of $0.47 per share. Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) was $100.5 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $108.8 million in fiscal 2018. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to lower debt outstanding during the fiscal 2019 as a result of the payment of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.13% 10-year senior notes 17that matured on December 1, 2017. Also, during fiscal 2018, Cintas paid off the term loan balance of $250.0 million with cash on hand. Income before income taxes was $1,102.4 million, an increase of $261.4 million, or 31.1%, compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in income before income taxes was primarily due to revenue growing at a faster pace than expenses, the gain on sale of a cost method investment and the decrease in integration expenses. Cintas' effective tax rate on continuing operations was 19.9% for fiscal 2019 compared to 6.8% in fiscal 2018. The effective tax rate in both periods was impacted by certain discrete items (primarily the tax accounting for stock-based compensation). The effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was also largely impacted by the one-time revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). Net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2019 of $882.6 million was a 12.6% increase compared to fiscal 2018. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $7.97 was a 13.4% increase compared to fiscal 2018. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased primarily due to the increase in earnings from continuing operations explained above. Uniform Rental and Facility Services Reportable Operating SegmentUniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue increased $305.3 million, or 5.8%, and the cost of uniform rental and facility services increased $140.6 million, or 4.9%, due to the reasons previously discussed. The reportable operating segment's fiscal 2019 gross margin was 45.5% of revenue compared to 45.0% in fiscal 2018. The increase in gross margin was driven by new business sold by sales representatives, penetration of additional products and services into existing customers and continuous improvements in process efficiency.Selling and administrative expenses for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment increased $33.1 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. Selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue for fiscal 2019 was 27.6% compared to 28.6% in fiscal 2018. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue was due to revenue growing at a faster pace than labor and employee-partner related expenses and a one-time cash payment to employee-partners during fiscal 2018 following the enactment of the Tax Act. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment incurred $14.4 million and $41.9 million of integration expenses directly related to the G&K acquisition in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. The expenses incurred in fiscal 2019 consisted primarily of facility closure expenses. Income before income taxes increased $159.1 million to $976.7 million for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. Income before income taxes as a percent of revenue at 17.6% increased 200 basis points from 15.6% in fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily due to the increase in sales, the one-time cash payment to employee-partners in the prior year and the reduction in G&K integration expenses.First Aid and Safety Services Reportable Operating SegmentFirst Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment revenue increased $54.8 million in fiscal 2019, an 9.7% increase compared to fiscal 2018. Revenue increased organically by 9.7% as a result of increased sales volume. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 0.1% due to acquisitions and negatively impacted by 0.1% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.Cost of sales for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment increased $23.5 million, or 7.9%, in fiscal 2019, primarily due to higher sales volume. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment is defined as revenue less cost of goods, warehouse expenses, service expenses and training expenses. The gross margin as a percent of revenue was 48.0% for fiscal 2019 compared to 47.1% in fiscal 2018. The increase was primarily driven by improved sourcing, leveraging of existing warehouses and optimization of delivery routes. Selling and administrative expenses for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment increased by $16.4 million, or 8.6%, in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were 33.4% in fiscal 2019 compared to 33.7% in fiscal 2018. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue was due to revenue growing at a faster pace than labor and employee-partner related expenses and the one-time cash payment to employee-partners during fiscal 2018. 18Income before income taxes for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment was $90.1 million in fiscal 2019, an increase of $14.9 million, or 19.8%, compared to fiscal 2018. Income before income taxes as a percent of revenue at 14.5%, increased from 13.3% in fiscal 2018 due to the previously discussed growth in revenue, improvement in the gross margin percentage and improvement in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue. Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2018 total revenue was $6.5 billion, an increase of 21.7% over the prior fiscal year. Revenue increased organically by 7.1% as a result of increased sales volume. Organic growth adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Total revenue was positively impacted by 14.3% due to acquisitions, primarily G&K. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 0.3% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Organic growth by quarter for fiscal 2018 is as follows: Organic Growth First Quarter Ended August 31, 20178.3%Second Quarter Ended November 30, 20177.7%Third Quarter Ended February 28, 20187.8%Fourth Quarter Ended May 31, 20185.1% For the Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 20187.1%Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue consists predominantly of revenue derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms and other garments, including flame resistant clothing, and the rental and/or sale of mats, mops, shop towels, restroom supplies and other rental services. Revenue from the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment increased 24.9% compared to fiscal 2017. Revenue was positively impacted by 17.9% due to acquisitions, primarily G&K. The remaining increase primarily resulted from an organic growth increase in revenue of 6.7%. The amount of new business grew, resulting from an increase in the number and productivity of sales representatives. Generally, sales productivity improvements are the result of increased tenure and improved training, which result in a higher number of products and services sold. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 0.3% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.Other revenue, consisting of revenue from the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other, increased 9.7% compared to fiscal 2017. Revenue increased organically by 8.6% due primarily to improved sales representative productivity. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 0.1% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Acquisitions positively impacted revenue by 1.0%.Cost of uniform rental and facility services increased 25.1% compared to fiscal 2017. Cost of uniform rental and facility services consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory, including uniforms, mats, shop towels and other ancillary items. The cost of uniform rental and facility services increase compared to fiscal 2017 was due to increased Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment sales volume from organic growth and the acquired G&K sales volume.Cost of other consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly first aid and safety products, uniforms and fire protection products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other. Cost of other increased 7.2% in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily related to the increased sales volumes in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other.Selling and administrative expenses increased $389.4 million, or 25.5%, compared to fiscal 2017 due primarily to a one-time cash payment to employee-partners, increased labor and other employee-partner related expenses as a result of the acquisition of G&K, increased amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired as a result of the G&K acquisition and increased costs related to investments in a new enterprise resource planning system. The one-time cash payment to employee-partners was made following the enactment of the Tax Act, which was signed into legislation by the President on December 22, 2017. The one-time cash payment to employee-partners amounted to an expense of approximately $40 million, or 0.6% of total revenue. Operating income for fiscal 2018 was negatively impacted by $41.9 millio19n, or 0.6% of total revenue, from transaction and integration expenses incurred in connection with the G&K acquisition and $79.2 million, or 1.5% of total revenue, in fiscal 2017.Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) was $108.8 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $86.3 million in fiscal 2017. The increase in net interest expense is primarily due to the additional debt issued to finance the G&K acquisition.Income before income taxes was $841.0 million, an increase of $153.6 million, or 22.3%, compared to fiscal 2017. The increase in income before income taxes was primarily due to revenue growing at a faster pace than expenses. Cintas' effective tax rate on continuing operations was 6.8% for fiscal 2018 compared to 33.5% in fiscal 2017. The decrease was due to the impact of the Tax Act. The effective tax rate in fiscal 2017 was impacted by certain discrete items (primarily the tax accounting for stock-based compensation).Net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2018 of $783.9 million was a 71.4% increase compared to fiscal 2017. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $7.03 was a 68.6% increase compared to fiscal 2017. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased primarily due to the lower effective tax rate as a result of the Tax Act, the gain on the sale of Discontinued Services and higher gross margin.Uniform Rental and Facility Services Reportable Operating SegmentUniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue increased $1,044.6 million, or 24.9%, and the cost of uniform rental and facility services increased $579.2 million, or 25.1%, as previously discussed. The reportable operating segment's fiscal 2018 gross margin was 45.0% of revenue compared to 45.1% in fiscal 2017. The slight decrease in gross margin was driven by the G&K acquisition, which had lower margins than the legacy Cintas margins. In addition, we incurred expected integration inefficiencies which impacted margins in the short-term.Selling and administrative expenses for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment increased $362.3 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. Selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue for fiscal 2018 was 28.6% compared to 27.1% in fiscal 2017. The increase in selling and administrative expenses for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment was primarily related to a onetime cash payment to employee-partners, increased labor and employee-partner related expenses as a result of the G&K acquisition, increased amortization expense related to intangibles acquired as a result of the G&K acquisition and an investment in an enterprise resource planning system.As a result of the G&K acquisition, the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment incurred $41.9 million of transaction and integration expenses directly related to the acquisition. The expenses incurred in fiscal 2018 consisted of lease cancellation costs, facility closure expenses and other integration related expenses. Income before income taxes increased $140.5 million to $817.6 million for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. Income before income taxes as a percent of revenue at 15.6% decreased 50 basis points from 16.1% in fiscal 2017. The decrease is primarily due to the increase in selling and administrative expenses as previously discussed.First Aid and Safety Services Reportable Operating SegmentFirst Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment revenue increased $56.5 million in fiscal 2018, an 11.1% increase compared to fiscal 2017. Revenue increased organically by 10.5% as a result of increased sales volume. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 0.5% due to acquisitions. Cost of first aid and safety services increased $20.9 million, or 7.5%, in fiscal 2018, due primarily to higher sales volume. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment is defined as revenue less cost of goods, warehouse expenses, service expenses and training expenses. The gross margin as a percent of revenue was 47.1% for fiscal 2018 compared to 45.3% in fiscal 2017. The increase was driven primarily by improved sourcing, leveraging of existing warehouses and optimization of delivery routes. Selling and administrative expenses for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment increased by $13.2 million, or 7.4%, in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017. The increase was due primarily to increased labor, including a one-time cash payment to employee-partners. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue 20were 33.7% in fiscal 2018 compared to 34.9% in fiscal 2017. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue was due to revenue growing at a faster pace than labor and employee-partner related expenses.Income before income taxes was $75.2 million in fiscal 2018, an increase of $22.4 million, or 42.5%, compared to fiscal 2017. Income before income taxes as a percent of revenue at 13.3%, increased from 10.4% in fiscal 2017 due to the previously discussed growth in revenue, improvement in the gross margin percentage and improvement in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe following table summarizes our cash flows and cash and cash equivalents as of and for the fiscal years ended May 31:(In thousands)2019 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities$1,067,862 $964,160Net cash used in investing activities$(235,638) $(135,698)Net cash used in financing activities$(873,305) $(864,140) Cash and cash equivalents at end of year$96,645 $138,724Cash and cash equivalents as of May 31, 2019 and 2018 include $28.5 million and $33.9 million, respectively, that is located outside of the United States. Cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. We generally use these cash flows to fund most, if not all, of our operations and expansion activities and dividends on our common stock. We may also use cash flows provided by operating activities, as well as proceeds from long-term debt and short-term borrowings, to fund growth and expansion opportunities, as well as other cash requirements such as the repurchase of our common stock and payment of long-term debt. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.1 billion for fiscal 2019, which was an increase of $103.7 million compared to fiscal 2018. The increase was the result of higher net income and favorable changes in deferred taxes, partially offset by changes in working capital.Net cash used in investing activities was $235.6 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $135.7 million in fiscal 2018. Capital expenditures were $276.7 million and $271.7 million for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 included $220.4 million for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment and $36.8 million for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment. Cash paid for acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, was $9.8 million and $19.3 million for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. The acquisitions in both fiscal 2019 and 2018 occurred in our Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, our First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and our Fire Protection business, which is included in All Other. In fiscal 2019, investing activities included proceeds of $73.3 million from the sale of a cost method investment and $3.2 million from the sale of a business included in discontinued operations, and during fiscal 2018, included proceeds of $127.8 million related to the sale of Discontinued Services. Net cash used in investing activities also included $17.8 million of investment purchases during fiscal 2019 and net proceeds of $26.1 million from purchases and redemptions of marketable securities and investments during fiscal 2018. Net cash used in financing activities was $873.3 million for fiscal 2019, compared to $864.1 million in fiscal 2018. The increase in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018 is primarily due to the repurchase of common stock in fiscal 2019. On August 2, 2016, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $500.0 million share buyback program. During fiscal 2019, under the August 2, 2016 share buyback program, we purchased a total of 2.1 million shares of Cintas common stock at an average price of $192.55 per share for a total purchase price of $410.0 million to complete the August 2, 2016 share buyback program. On October 30, 2018, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a new $1.0 billion share buyback program, which does not have an expiration date. During fiscal 2019, under this new program, we purchased 2.7 million shares of Cintas common stock at an average price of $203.30 for a total purchase price of $543.4 million. During fiscal 2018, under the August 2, 2016 share buyback program, we purchased 0.5 million shares of Cintas common at an average price of $173.51 per share for a total purchase price of $90.0 million. Subsequent to May 31, 2019 through July 26, 2019, under the new share buyback program, Cintas purchased 0.8 million shares at an average price of $230.66 per share for a total purchase price of $193.1 million. From the inception of the October 30, 2018 share buyba21ck program through July 26, 2019, Cintas has purchased a total of 3.5 million shares of Cintas common stock at an average price of $209.82 for a total purchase price of $736.5 million. Also, for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019, Cintas acquired 0.3 million shares of Cintas common stock in satisfaction of employee payroll taxes due on restricted stock awards that vested during the fiscal year. These shares were acquired at an average price of $204.50 per share for a total purchase price of $62.9 million.On October 30, 2018, Cintas declared an annual cash dividend of $2.05 per share on outstanding common stock, a26.5% increase over the annual dividend paid in the prior year. The dividend was paid on December 7, 2018 to shareholders of record as of November 9, 2018. This marked the 36th consecutive year that Cintas has increased its annual dividend, every year since going public in 1983.During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019, Cintas issued a net total of $112.5 million of commercial paper and received proceeds of $200.0 million as a result of a new term loan. During fiscal 2018, Cintas paid a net total of $50.5 million of commercial paper and paid off the term loan balance of $250.0 million with cash on hand. On December 1, 2017, Cintas paid the $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.13% 10-year senior notes that matured on that date with cash on hand and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. The following table summarizes Cintas' outstanding debt at May 31:(In thousands)Interest Rate Fiscal YearIssued Fiscal YearMaturity 2019 2018 Debt due within one year Commercial paper2.68%(1) 2019 2020 $112,500 $—Term loan3.06%(1) 2019 2020 200,000 —Debt issuance costs (236) —Total debt due within one year $312,264 $— Debt due after one year Senior notes4.30% 2012 2022 $250,000 $250,000Senior notes2.90% 2017 2022 650,000 650,000Senior notes3.25% 2013 2023 300,000 300,000Senior notes (2)2.78% 2013 2023 51,684 52,119Senior notes (3)3.11% 2015 2025 51,973 52,309Senior notes3.70% 2017 2027 1,000,000 1,000,000Senior notes6.15% 2007 2037 250,000 250,000Debt issuance costs (16,150) (19,119) Total debt due after one year $2,537,507 $2,535,309(1) Variable rate debt instrument.

The interest rate shown above is the effective interest rate. The principal amount of these notes is $50.0 million with a stated interest rate of 3.73%. (3) Cintas assumed these senior notes with the acquisition of G&K in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and they were recorded at fair value. The interest rate shown above is the effective interest rate. The principal amount of these notes is $50.0 million with a stated interest rate of 3.88%. The credit agreement that supports our commercial paper program was amended and restated on May 24, 2019. The amendment increased the capacity of the revolving credit facility from $600.0 million to $1.0 billion and created a new term loan of $200.0 million. The credit agreement has an accordion feature that provides Cintas the ability to request increases to the borrowing commitments under either the revolving credit facility or the term loan of up to $250.0 million in the aggregate, subject to customary conditions. The maturity date of the revolving credit facility is May 22, 2024, and the maturity date of the term loan is May 22, 2020, which can be extended 12 months, annually, for up to four years. As of May 31, 2019, there was $112.5 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 2.7% and maturity dates less than 30 days and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility. No commercial paper or borrowings on our revolving credit facility were outstanding at May 31, 2018. 22Cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements. These covenants limit Cintas' ability to incur certain liens, to engage in sale-leaseback transactions and to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of Cintas' assets. These covenants also require Cintas to maintain certain debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and interest coverage ratios. Cross-default provisions exist between certain debt instruments. If a default of a significant covenant were to occur, the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness, impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital. Cintas was in compliance with all of the debt covenants for all periods presented. Our access to the commercial paper and long-term debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity. We do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past. Our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend, to a significant degree, on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness. As of May 31, 2019, our ratings were as follows:Rating Agency Outlook Commercial Paper Long-term Debt Standard & Poor’s Stable A-2 A-Moody’s Investors Service Stable P-2 A3In the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding long-term debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason, or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of long-term debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above, particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings, our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected. In addition, in such a case, our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and long-term debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies. To monitor our credit rating and our capacity for long-term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. One such factor is the ratio of our total debt to EBITDA. For the purpose of this calculation, debt is defined as the sum of short-term borrowings, long-term debt due within one year, obligations under capital leases due in one year, long-term debt, long-term obligations under capital leases and standby letters of credit.

As of May 31, 2019, Cintas had approximately $312.5 million of variable rate debt outstanding, which consisted of $112.5 million of commercial paper and a $200.0 million term loan. The interest payments for variable rate debt were estimated using forecasted rates in future years.Cintas also makes payments to defined contribution plans and may make payments to defined benefit plans to satisfy minimum funding requirements. The amount of contributions made to the defined contribution plans are at the discretion of the Board of Directors of Cintas. Future contributions to the defined contribution plans are expected to be $73.6 million in the next year, $158.4 million in the next two to three years and $174.7 million in the next four to five years. Future contributions to the defined benefit plans are expected to be $3.1 million in the next year, $6.1 million in the next two to three years and $6.1 million in the next four to five years. 23Other Commitments Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period(In thousands)Total One yearor less Two tothree years Four tofive years After fiveyears Lines of credit (1)$887,377 $— $— $887,377 $—Standby letters of credit and surety bonds (2)120,637 120,637 — — —Total other commitments$1,008,014 $120,637 $— $887,377 $—(1) Back-up facility for the commercial paper program (reference Note 7 entitled Debt and Derivatives of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for further discussion).(2) These standby letters of credit and surety bonds support certain outstanding debt (reference Note 7 entitled Debt and Derivatives of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements""), self-insured workers' compensation and general liability insurance programs.Inflation and Changing PricesChanges in wages, benefits and energy costs have the potential to materially impact Cintas' consolidated financial results. Management believes inflation has not had a material impact on Cintas' consolidated financial condition or a negative impact on consolidated results of operations.Litigation and Other ContingenciesCintas is subject to legal proceedings, insurance receipts, legal settlements and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary course of business actions will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows of Cintas. New Accounting StandardsIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),"" to clarify revenue recognition principles. This guidance is intended to improve disclosure requirements and enhance the comparability of revenue recognition practices. Improved disclosures under the amended guidance relate to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized from contracts with customers. We adopted ASU 2014-09, and all the related amendments, effective June 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. ASU 2014-09 requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Upon adoption of ASU 2014-09, we recorded an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of June 1, 2018. The adjustment to retained earnings primarily relates to the capitalization of certain direct and incremental contract costs required by the new guidance. Capitalized costs are amortized ratably over the anticipated period of benefit. We applied ASU 2014-09 only to contracts that were not completed prior to fiscal 2019. Results for reporting periods beginning after May 31, 2018 are presented under ASU 2014-09, while comparative prior period amounts have not been restated and continue to be presented under accounting standards in effect in those periods.There were two implementation adjustments upon adoption of ASU 2014-09: (1) capitalization of certain direct and incremental contract costs and (2) the timing of revenue recognition for certain contracts with customers that create an asset with no alternative use to the Company and an enforceable right of payment from the customer upon termination. Adoption of ASU 2014-09 impacted the Company's previously reported results as of May 31, 2018 as follows:Capitalization of Contract Costs. The Company has elected to apply the guidance, as a practical expedient, to a portfolio of contracts (or performance obligations) with similar characteristics because the Company reasonably expects that the effects on the consolidated financial statements of applying this guidance to the portfolio would not differ materially from applying this guidance to the individual contracts within the portfolio. The Company also continues to expense certain costs to obtain a contract if those costs do not meet the criteria of the new standard or the amortization period of the asset would have been one year or less.24Assets With No Alternative Use. For our Uniform Direct Sale business, our revenue, prior to the adoption of ASU 2014-09, was primarily generated from the sale of finished products to customers as products are shipped and title passes to the customers. For certain contracts with customers, the Company creates an asset with no alternative use to the Company, and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. For these contracts, we have moved from a point-in-time model to an over-time model in which our measure of progress is finished goods with no alternative use in accordance with the provisions of ASU 2014-09. We expect ASU 2014-09 will have no cash impact and will not affect the economics of our underlying customer contracts.

The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Topic 842 provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition, and we have determined to use certain of these practical expedients. The Company plans to elect the package of practical expedients permitted under Topic 842, which allows a lessee to carryforward their population of existing leases, the classification of each lease, as well as the treatment of initial direct costs as of the period of adoption. The Company also plans to elect the practical expedient related to lease and non-lease components, as an accounting policy election for all asset classes, which allows a lessee to not separate non-lease from lease components and instead account for consideration paid in a contract as a single lease component. In addition, the Company plans to elect the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases with a term of 12 months or less, which means it will not recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for these leases. The Company does not expect to elect the use-of-hindsight practical expedient. This guidance will be adopted by the Company on June 1, 2019. In accordance with Topic 842, a registrant can elect not to present comparative financial information under Topic 842 if it recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption. The Company intends to make this transition election. The Company has implemented a new lease system in connection with the adoption of Topic 842. The majority of our lease spend relates to certain real estate with the remaining lease spend primarily related to vehicles and equipment. Based on the Company's portfolio of leases at May 31, 2019, approximately $160.0 million to $185.0 million of lease assets and liabilities will be recognized on the balance sheet upon adoption. We do not expect a material impact on the consolidated statements of income or consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company is substantially complete with its implementation efforts. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.” ASU 2016-15 makes eight targeted changes to how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company’s adoption of this standard on June 1, 2018 did not have a material impact on its consolidated statements of cash flows.26In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.” ASU 2017-04 eliminates the two-step process that required identification of potential impairment and a separate measure of the actual impairment. Goodwill impairment charges, if any, would be determined by the difference between a reporting unit's carrying value and its fair value (impairment loss is limited to the carrying value). This standard is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, “Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Costs.” ASU 2017-07 continues to require the service component of pension and other postretirement benefit costs to be presented in the same line item as other employee compensation costs on the consolidated statement of income and changes the presentation of other components of net benefit cost so that these items will be presented outside of operating income within the consolidated statements of income. Cintas retrospectively adopted ASU 2017-07 on June 1, 2017. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, “Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.” ASU 2017-12 better aligns an entity’s risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results. Among other amendments, the update allows entities to designate the variability in cash flows attributable to changes in a contractually specified component stated in the contract as the hedged risk in a cash flow hedge of a forecasted purchase or sale of a nonfinancial asset. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. We adopted the standard effective as of June 1, 2018, and the effect of adoption of this standard did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, ""Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income."" ASU 2018-02 allows entities to elect to reclassify the income tax effects of the Tax Act on items within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings and requires additional related disclosures. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Cintas is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2018-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements.In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” ASU 2016-13 will replace the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. In connection with recognizing credit losses on receivables and other financial instruments, Cintas will be required to use a forward-looking expected loss model rather than the incurred loss model. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard will be through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. Cintas is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statements. No other new accounting pronouncement recently issued or newly effective had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.27Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of Cintas' consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with Note 1 entitled Significant Accounting Policies of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."" Significant changes, estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.Revenue recognitionRental revenue, which is recorded in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, is recognized when services are performed. Other revenue, which is recorded in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segments and All Other, is recognized when either services are performed or the obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. See Note 2 entitled Revenue Recognition of the ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for more information on Cintas' revenue. Uniforms and other rental items in serviceUniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization, calculated using the straight-line method. Uniforms in service (other than cleanroom and flame resistant clothing) are amortized over their useful life of 18 months. Other rental items, including shop towels, mats, mops, cleanroom garments, flame resistant clothing, linens and restroom dispensers, are amortized over their useful lives, which range from 8 to 60 months. The amortization rates used are based on industry experience, Cintas' specific experience and wear tests performed by Cintas. These factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory and related cost of uniforms and ancillary products that are presented in the consolidated financial statements.Property and equipmentDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets based on industry and Cintas specific experience, which is typically 30 to 40 years for buildings, 5 to 20 years for building improvements, 3 to 10 years for equipment and 2 to 15 years for leasehold improvements. When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the carrying amount of the assets. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss is recorded based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is generally determined by discounted cash flows or based on prices of similar assets, as appropriate. Cintas did not identify any indicators of impairment for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2019 and 2018. GoodwillGoodwill, obtained through acquisitions of businesses, is valued at cost less any impairment. Cintas completes an annual impairment test, that includes an assessment of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. Cintas has identified four reporting units for purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment: Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services and two reporting units within All Other. Based on the results of the annual impairment tests, Cintas was not required to recognize an impairment of goodwill for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017. Cintas will continue to perform impairment tests as of March 1 in future years and when indicators of impairment exist.Service contracts and other assetsService contracts and other assets, which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses, are amortized by use of the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the agreements, which are generally 5 to 10 years. The G&K service contract asset is being amortized over a period of 15 years, which represents the estimated life of the economic benefit and the asset amortization is based on the annual economic value of the underlying asset, which generally decreases over the 15-year term. Certain noncompete agreements, as well as all service contracts, require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model. The assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates, among other factors. Because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets, actual results over time could vary from original estimates. Impairment of service contracts and other assets is accomplished through specific identification. No impairment has been recognized by Cintas for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017.28Business Combinations Accounting for acquisitions requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income. General insurance liabilities General insurance liabilities represent the estimated ultimate cost of all asserted and unasserted claims incurred, primarily related to worker's compensation, auto liability and other general liability exposure through the consolidated balance sheet dates. Our reserves are estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for specific expectations based on our claims history. Cintas records an increase or decrease in selling and administrative expenses related to development of prior claims, higher claims activity and other environmental factors in the period in which it becomes known. These changes in estimates may be material to the consolidated financial statements.Stock-based compensationCompensation expense is recognized for all share-based payments to employees, including stock options and restricted stock awards, in the consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of the awards that are granted. The fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Generally, measured compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the related share-based compensation award. See Note 13 entitled Stock-Based Compensation of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for further information.Litigation and other contingenciesCintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. U.S. GAAP requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. While a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities, Cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements.Income taxesDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. See Note 9 entitled Income Taxes of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes. Cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets, as adjusted for valuation allowances, will be realized. Accounting for uncertain tax positions requires the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Companies may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.Cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions, Cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate. Based on Cintas' evaluation of current tax positions, Cintas believes its tax related accruals are appropriate.29Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskEarnings may be affected by changes in short-term interest rates due to investments, if any, in marketable securities and money market accounts and periodic issuances of commercial paper. If short-term rates changed by one-half percent (or 50 basis points), Cintas' income before income taxes would change by approximately $1.1 million. This estimated exposure considers the effects on investments. This analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in Cintas' capital structure.Through its foreign operations, Cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk. Foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into U.S. dollars. Foreign denominated revenue and profit represents less than 10% of Cintas' consolidated revenue and profit. Cintas periodically uses foreign currency hedges such as average rate options and forward contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements resulting from foreign currency revenue and from international cash flows. The primary foreign currency to which Cintas is exposed is the Canadian dollar.30",2023-12-30 21:41:58.295768

Our broad range of products and services allows our sales organization to consider any type of business a prospect. We also broaden our customer base through geographic expansion, especially in our first aid and safety and fire protection businesses. Finally, we evaluate strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise.Results of OperationsThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations focuses on discussion of fiscal 2020 results compared to 2019 results. For discussion of fiscal 2019 results compared to fiscal 2018 results, see the ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on July 26, 2019.Cintas classifies its business into two reportable operating segments and places the remainder of its operating segments in an All Other category. Cintas’ two reportable operating segments are the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment and the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing, mats, mops and shop towels and other ancillary items. In addition to these rental items, restroom cleaning services and supplies, carpet and tile cleaning services and the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route are included within this reportable operating segment. The First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment consists of first aid and safety products and services. The remainder of Cintas’ business, which consists of Fire Protection Services operating segment and the Uniform Direct Sale operating segment, is included in All Other. These operating segments consist of fire protection products and services and the direct sale of uniforms and related items. Cintas evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and income before income taxes. Revenue and income before income taxes for each of these reportable operating segments for the years ended May 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are presented in Note 14 entitled Operating Segment Information of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."" The Company regularly reviews its operating segments for reporting purposes based on the information its chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance and makes changes when appropriate.16In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic. Through the first three quarters of fiscal 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a significant impact on our business. However, efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 intensified during our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter. Most states and municipalities within the U.S. enacted temporary closures of businesses, issued quarantine orders and took other restrictive measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Within the U.S., our business was designated an essential business, which allowed us to continue to serve customers that remained open.We have operations throughout the U.S. and participate in a global supply chain. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the existence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the fear associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the reactions of governments around the world in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to regulate the flow of labor and products and impede the business of our customers, impacted our ability to conduct normal business operations, which had an adverse effect on our business. In response to the impact of COVID-19, Cintas put in place health and safety measures to keep Cintas employees, contractors and customers safe. These health and safety measures have not materially impacted our ability to service our customers. Many of Cintas' customers were also impacted by COVID-19 and we did see an impact on some customer's ability to pay. While there was minimal disruption to our supply chain, Cintas did experience an increase in inventory caused by the impact of COVID-19. See Note 1 entitled Significant Accounting Policies of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for additional detail on steps taken to assess the higher collection risk related to our customers and the additional reserve placed on inventory. Cintas also initiated certain activities to reduce operating costs and better align its workforce with the needs of its ongoing business. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, Cintas recorded $24.5 million in employee termination costs and $9.2 million in long-lived asset impairment costs. See Note 1 entitled Significant Accounting Policies of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."" The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve, and therefore, we cannot predict the extent to which our business, consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial condition or liquidity will ultimately be impacted.17The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percent of revenue by reportable operating segment, All Other and in total for the fiscal years ended May 31:202020192018Revenue: Uniform Rental and Facility Services79.7%80.6%81.0%First Aid and Safety Services10.0%9.0%8.7%All Other10.3%10.4%10.3%Total revenue100.0%100.0%100.0%Cost of sales: Uniform Rental and Facility Services54.1%54.5%55.0%First Aid and Safety Services52.2%52.0%52.9%All Other58.2%57.4%57.5%Total cost of sales54.4%54.6%55.1%Gross margin: Uniform Rental and Facility Services45.9%45.5%45.0%First Aid and Safety Services47.8%48.0%47.1%All Other41.8%42.6%42.5%Total gross margin45.6%45.4%44.9%Selling and administrative expenses:Uniform Rental and Facility Services28.1%27.6%28.6%First Aid and Safety Services32.7%33.4%33.7%All Other34.9%33.3%33.9%Total selling and administrative expenses29.2%28.7%29.6%G&K Services, Inc. integration expenses—%0.2%0.6%Gain on sale of a cost method investment—%1.0%—%Interest expense, net1.5%1.5%1.7%Income from continuing operations before income taxes14.9%16.0%13.0%18Fiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019 Fiscal 2020 total revenue was $7.1 billion, an increase of 2.8% over the prior fiscal year. Revenue increased organically by 3.1% as a result of increased sales volume. Organic growth adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and workday differences. Total revenue was positively impacted by 0.2% due to acquisitions, negatively impacted by 0.1% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and negatively impacted by 0.4% due to one less workday in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. As previously discussed, the government enactment of temporary closures of certain businesses in response to COVID-19 impacted our ability to service some of our customers during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. As a result, revenue in the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by COVID-19. Due to the constantly changing impact of COVID-19, uncertainty remains about the pace of the economic recovery and about its impact on future Cintas consolidated financial results.Organic growth by quarter for fiscal 2020 is as follows: Organic GrowthFirst quarter ended August 31, 20198.3%Second quarter ended November 30, 20197.3%Third quarter ended February 29, 20205.7%Fourth quarter ended May 31, 2020-8.4%For the fiscal year ended May 31, 20203.1%Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue consists predominantly of revenue derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms and other garments, including flame resistant clothing, and the rental and/or sale of mats, mops, shop towels, restroom supplies and other rental services. Revenue from the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment increased 1.6% compared to fiscal 2019 due to an organic growth increase of 2.0%. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 0.1% due to acquisitions, negatively impacted by 0.1% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and negatively impacted by 0.4% due to one less workday in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. Revenue growth was a result of new business, the penetration of additional products and services into existing customers and price increases, partially offset by lost business. New business growth resulted from an increase in the number and productivity of sales representatives. Generally, sales productivity improvements are due to increased tenure and improved training, which produce a higher number of products and services sold. Other revenue, consisting of revenue from the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other, increased 7.6% compared to fiscal 2019. Revenue increased organically by 7.5% primarily due to improved sales representative productivity and the increased sales of personal protective equipment, offset by a decrease in sales related to customers in All Other as a result of the impact from COVID-19. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 0.5% due to acquisitions and negatively impacted by 0.4% due to one less workday in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019.Cost of uniform rental and facility services increased 0.9% compared to fiscal 2019. Cost of uniform rental and facility services consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory, including uniforms, mats, shop towels and other ancillary items. The cost of uniform rental and facility services increase compared to fiscal 2019 was due to increased Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment sales volume from organic growth, partially offset by fewer inventory purchases and a reduced amount of inventory put in service during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.Cost of other consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly first aid and safety products, uniforms and fire protection products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other. Cost of other increased 8.2% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily related to the increased sales volumes in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and an increase in the proportion of sales from personal protective equipment.Selling and administrative expenses increased $90.4 million, or 4.6%, compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to increases in labor and other employee-partner related expenses. In addition, as previously discussed, Cintas 19initiated certain activities to reduce operating costs and better align its workforce with the needs of its ongoing business. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, Cintas recorded $24.5 million in employee termination costs and $9.2 million in long-lived asset impairment costs. Operating income in fiscal 2019 was negatively impacted by $14.4 million of integration expenses incurred in connection with the G&K Services, Inc. (G&K) acquisition. The after-tax effect of these integration expenses represents a negative impact on diluted earnings per share of $0.10 per share in fiscal 2019. No material integration expenses were recorded in fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2019, Cintas sold a cost method investment for $73.3 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $69.4 million. The after-tax effect of the one-time gain represents a positive impact on diluted earnings per share of $0.47 per share. Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) was $104.4 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $100.5 million in fiscal 2019. The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2020 was due to the timing of interest being incurred on our term loan in the current year (twelve months as opposed to one month in fiscal 2019), partially offset by lower commercial paper borrowings in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. Income before income taxes was $1,058.3 million, a decrease of $44.1 million, or 4.0%, compared to fiscal 2019. The decrease in income before income taxes was primarily due to the negative impact of COVID-19, as previously discussed, as well as the fiscal 2019 one-time gain on sale of a cost method investment. Cintas' effective tax rate on continuing operations was 17.2% for fiscal 2020 compared to 19.9% in fiscal 2019. The effective tax rate in both periods was impacted by certain permanent differences (primarily the tax accounting for stock-based compensation). Net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2020 of $876.4 million was a 0.7% decrease compared to fiscal 2019. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $8.11 was a 1.8% increase compared to fiscal 2019 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $7.97. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased primarily due to the positive impact from the lower diluted weighted average common shares outstanding during fiscal 2020.Uniform Rental and Facility Services Reportable Operating SegmentUniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue increased $91.1 million, or 1.6%, and the cost of uniform rental and facility services increased $27.5 million, or 0.9%, due to the reasons previously discussed. The reportable operating segment's fiscal 2020 gross margin was 45.9% of revenue compared to 45.5% in fiscal 2019. The increase in gross margin was driven by new business sold by sales representatives, penetration of additional products and services into existing customers and continuous improvements in process efficiency.Selling and administrative expenses for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment increased $50.1 million in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. Selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue for fiscal 2020 was 28.1% compared to 27.6% in fiscal 2019. The increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue was due to increases in labor and other employee-partner related expenses as well as impacts caused by COVID-19. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment initiated certain activities to reduce operating costs and better align its workforce with the needs of its ongoing business. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the reportable operating segment recorded $20.2 million in employee termination costs and $9.2 million in long-lived asset impairment costs. Due to the constantly changing impact of COVID-19, it is uncertain if similar additional activities will be initiated in the future. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment incurred $14.4 million of integration expenses directly related to the G&K acquisition in fiscal 2019, which consisted primarily of facility closure expenses. There were no such expenses incurred in fiscal 2020. Income before income taxes increased $27.8 million to $1,004.6 million for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. Income before income taxes as a percent of revenue at 17.8% increased 20 basis points from 17.6% in fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily due to the increase in gross margin, which was partially offset by the previously discussed impacts of COVID-19.20First Aid and Safety Services Reportable Operating SegmentFirst Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment revenue increased $89.1 million in fiscal 2020, a 14.4% increase compared to fiscal 2019. Revenue increased organically by 14.8% as a result of new business and sales productivity increases, penetration of additional products and services into existing customers and sales of personal protective equipment in response to COVID-19. Revenue growth was negatively impacted by 0.4% due to one less workday in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019.Cost of sales for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment increased $47.5 million, or 14.7%, in fiscal 2020, primarily due to higher sales volume. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment is defined as revenue less cost of goods, warehouse expenses, service expenses and training expenses. The gross margin as a percent of revenue was 47.8% for fiscal 2020 compared to 48.0% in fiscal 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by an increase in the proportion of sales of personal protective equipment as a result of the impact of COVID-19.Selling and administrative expenses for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment increased by $24.8 million, or 12.0%, in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 due to increased labor and other employee-partner related expenses. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were 32.7% in fiscal 2020 compared to 33.4% in fiscal 2019. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue was due to revenue growing at a faster pace than labor and employee-partner related expenses. Income before income taxes for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment was $106.9 million in fiscal 2020, an increase of $16.8 million, or 18.7%, compared to fiscal 2019. Income before income taxes as a percent of revenue at 15.1%, increased from 14.5% in fiscal 2019 due to the previously discussed growth in revenue and improvement in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe following table summarizes our cash flows and cash and cash equivalents as of and for the fiscal years ended May 31:(In thousands)20202019Net cash provided by operating activities$1,291,483 $1,067,862 Net cash used in investing activities$(285,398) $(235,638) Net cash used in financing activities$(955,207) $(873,305) Cash and cash equivalents at end of year$145,402 $96,645 Cash and cash equivalents as of May 31, 2020 and 2019 include $30.2 million and $28.5 million, respectively, that is located outside of the U.S. Cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. We generally use these cash flows to fund most, if not all, of our operations and expansion activities and dividends on our common stock. We may also use cash flows provided by operating activities, as well as proceeds from long-term debt and short-term borrowings, to fund growth and expansion opportunities, as well as other cash requirements such as the repurchase of our common stock and payment of long-term debt. The disruption from COVID-19 negatively impacted Cintas' fiscal 2020 fourth quarter financial results, however, net cash flow provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter was not significantly impacted. At May 31, 2020, our short-term liquidity position remained solid, as our cash flows from operating activities are expected to remain sufficient to provide us with adequate levels of short-term liquidity. In addition, we have access to $1.0 billion of short-term debt from our revolving credit facility. However, our long-term liquidity position remains unclear due to the constantly changing scope and nature of the impacts of COVID-19. Accordingly, we have taken proactive measures to maintain financial flexibility within the landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe the Company has sufficient liquidity to operate in the current business environment as a result of these actions. In order to preserve cash during this time of uncertainty, we plan to limit/reduce capital expenditures to essential business needs. Also, we will limit share buybacks until we obtain more certainty regarding the impacts of COVID-19. Acquisitions and dividends remain strategic objectives, however, they will be dependent on the economic outlook and liquidity of the Company. 21Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion for fiscal 2020, which was an increase of $223.6 million compared to fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily the result of favorable changes in working capital, specifically accounts receivable and inventories.Net cash used in investing activities was $285.4 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $235.6 million in fiscal 2019. Net cash used in investing activities includes capital expenditures, purchases of investments, proceeds from the sale of assets, cost method investments and businesses and cash paid for acquisitions of businesses. Capital expenditures were $230.3 million and $276.7 million for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 included $183.4 million for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment and $35.7 million for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment. Cash paid for acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, was $53.7 million and $9.8 million for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. The acquisitions in both fiscal 2020 and 2019 occurred in our Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, our First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and our Fire Protection operating segment, which is included in All Other. In fiscal 2020, investing activities included proceeds of $13.3 million from the sale of assets, and in fiscal 2019, included proceeds of $73.3 million from the sale of a cost method investment and $3.2 million from the sale of a business included in discontinued operations. Net cash used in investing activities also included $10.0 million and $17.8 million of investment purchases during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities was $955.2 million for fiscal 2020, compared to $873.3 million in fiscal 2019. The increase in cash used from financing activities from fiscal 2019 is primarily due to the payment of the $312.5 million of debt in fiscal 2020 versus issuance of $312.5 million of debt in fiscal 2019, partially offset by a decrease in cash used to repurchase common stock. On August 2, 2016, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $500.0 million share buyback program. This program was completed in November 2018. On October 30, 2018, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion share buyback program, which does not have an expiration date. On October 29, 2019, we announced the Board of Directors authorized a new $1.0 billion share buyback program, which does not have an expiration date.

From the inception of the October 30, 2018 share buyback program through July 29, 2020, Cintas has purchased a total of 4.3 million shares of Cintas common stock at an average price of $219.42 for a total purchase price of $939.1 million. In addition, for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020, Cintas acquired 0.3 million shares of Cintas common stock in satisfaction of employee payroll taxes due on restricted stock awards that vested during the fiscal year. These shares were acquired at an average price of $260.89 per share for a total purchase price of $68.8 million. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019, Cintas acquired 0.3 million shares of Cintas common stock in satisfaction of employee payroll taxes due on restricted awards that vested during the fiscal year. These shares were acquired at an average price of 204.50 per share for a total purchase price of $62.9 million. On October 29, 2019, Cintas declared an annual cash dividend of $2.55 per share on outstanding common stock, a 24.4% increase over the annual dividend paid in the prior year. The dividend was paid on December 6, 2019, to shareholders of record as of November 8, 2019. This marked the 37th consecutive year that Cintas has increased its annual dividend, every year since going public in 1983.During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020, Cintas paid a net total of $112.5 million on commercial paper borrowings and paid off the term loan balance of $200.0 million with cash on hand. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019, Cintas issued $112.5 million, net of commercial paper borrowings and received proceeds of $200.0 million as a result of a new term loan. 22The following table summarizes Cintas' outstanding debt at May 31:(In thousands)Interest RateFiscal YearIssuedFiscal YearMaturity20202019Debt due within one yearCommercial paper2.68 %(1)20192020$— $112,500 Term loan3.06 %(1)20192020— 200,000 Debt issuance costs— (236) Total debt due within one year$— $312,264 Debt due after one yearSenior notes4.30 %20122022$250,000 $250,000 Senior notes2.90 %20172022650,000 650,000 Senior notes3.25 %20132023300,000 300,000 Senior notes (2)2.78 %2013202351,250 51,684 Senior notes (3)3.11 %2015202551,637 51,973 Senior notes3.70 %201720271,000,000 1,000,000 Senior notes6.15 %20072037250,000 250,000 Debt issuance costs(13,182) (16,150) Total debt due after one year$2,539,705 $2,537,507 (1) Variable rate debt instrument.

(3) Cintas assumed these senior notes with the acquisition of G&K in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and they were recorded at fair value. The interest rate shown above is the effective interest rate. The principal amount of these notes is $50.0 million with a stated interest rate of 3.88%. The credit agreement that supports our commercial paper program was amended and restated on May 24, 2019. The amendment increased the capacity of the revolving credit facility from $600.0 million to $1.0 billion and created a new term loan of $200.0 million. The credit agreement has an accordion feature that provides Cintas the ability to request increases to the borrowing commitments under either the revolving credit facility or the term loan of up to $250.0 million in the aggregate, subject to customary conditions. The maturity date of the revolving credit facility is May 23, 2024, and the maturity date of the term loan was May 23, 2020. As of May 31, 2020, there was no commercial paper outstanding and no borrowings on our credit facility. As of May 31, 2019, there was $112.5 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 2.7% and maturity dates less than 30 days and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements. These covenants limit Cintas' ability to incur certain liens, to engage in sale-leaseback transactions and to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of Cintas' assets. These covenants also require Cintas to maintain certain debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and interest coverage ratios. Cross-default provisions exist between certain debt instruments. If a default of a significant covenant were to occur, the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness, impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital. Cintas was in compliance with all of the debt covenants for all periods presented. Our access to the commercial paper and long-term debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity. We do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past. However, the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused disruption in the capital markets, could make financing more difficult and/or expensive. Additionally, our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend, to a significant degree, on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness. 23As of May 31, 2020, our ratings were as follows:Rating AgencyOutlookCommercial PaperLong-term DebtStandard & Poor’sNegativeA-2A-Moody’s Investors ServiceStableP-2A3Standard and Poor's change in outlook from stable to negative reflects the inherent uncertainty regarding the spread of COVID-19 and the potential impact to Cintas’ operating conditions, which could result in Cintas being unable to maintain adjusted leverage of less than two times total debt to EBITDA.In the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding long-term debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason, or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of long-term debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above, particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings, our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected. In addition, in such a case, our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and long-term debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies. To monitor our credit rating and our capacity for long-term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. One such factor is the ratio of our total debt to EBITDA. For the purpose of this calculation, debt is defined as the sum of short-term borrowings, long-term debt due within one year, long-term debt and standby letters of credit. We have assessed the impact of events subsequent to our balance sheet date but prior to the issuance of this filing. The impact from COVID-19, however, continues to evolve, and the scope and nature of the impacts of COVID-19 remain unclear. As such, our conclusions regarding both our short-term and long-term liquidity position remain unchanged. Management will continue to evaluate the Company’s liquidity position and our near- and longer-term financial performance as we manage the Company through the uncertainty related to COVID-19.Financial and Nonfinancial Disclosure About Issuers and Guarantors of Cintas’ Senior NotesAs discussed in Note 7 entitled Debt and Derivatives of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,"" Cintas Corporation No. 2 (Corp. 2) is the indirectly, wholly owned principal operating subsidiary of Cintas. Corp. 2 is the issuer of the $2,550.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding as of May 31, 2020, which are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Cintas Corporation and its wholly owned, direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries.Basis of Preparation of the Summarized Financial InformationThe following tables include summarized financial information of Cintas Corporation (Issuer), Corp. 2 and subsidiary guarantors (together, the Obligor Group). Investments in and equity in the earnings of non-guarantors, which are not members of the Obligor Group, have been excluded. Non-guarantor subsidiaries are located outside the U.S., and therefore, excluded from the Obligor Group.The summarized financial information of the Obligor Group is presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances and transactions between entities in the Obligor Group eliminated. The Obligor Group’s amounts due from, amounts due to and transactions with non-guarantors have been presented in separate line items, if they are material.

The amount of contributions made to the defined contribution plans are at the discretion of the Board of Directors of Cintas. Future contributions to the defined contribution plans are expected to be $70.2 million in the next year, $151.2 million in the next two to three years and $166.7 million in the next four to five years.

Management believes inflation has not had a material impact on Cintas' consolidated financial condition or a negative impact on the consolidated results of operations.25Litigation and Other ContingenciesCintas is subject to legal proceedings, insurance receipts, legal settlements and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary course of business actions will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows of Cintas. The Company and three executive officers were defendants in a purported class action, filed on December 12, 2019, pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio alleging violations of federal securities laws. The lawsuit asserted that the defendants made material misstatements regarding the Company’s margins, earnings guidance and regulatory compliance that caused the Company's stock to trade at artificially inflated prices between March 2017 and November 2019. The lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice on April 22, 2020. The Company, the Board of Directors, CEO and the Investment Policy Committee are defendants in a purported class action, filed on December 13, 2019, pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio alleging violations of ERISA. The lawsuit asserts that the defendants improperly managed the costs of the employee retirement plan, breached their fiduciary duties in failing to investigate and select lower cost alternative funds and failed to monitor and control the employee retirement plan’s recordkeeping costs. The defendants deny liability.New Accounting StandardsIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” as amended. Cintas adopted this standard effective June 1, 2019, using a modified retrospective transition approach. Topic 842 requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Topic 842 provided a number of optional practical expedients in transition, and we have determined to use certain of these practical expedients upon our adoption of Topic 842. Specifically, the Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under Topic 842, which allows a lessee to carryforward their population of existing leases, the classification of each lease, as well as the treatment of initial direct lease costs as of the period of adoption. The Company also elected the practical expedient related to lease and non-lease components, as an accounting policy election for the fleet and vehicle asset class, which allows a lessee to not separate non-lease from lease components and instead account for consideration paid in a contract as a single lease component. In addition, the Company elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases with a term of 12 months or less, which means it will not recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for these leases. The adoption of Topic 842, on June 1, 2019, resulted in the Company recognizing right-of-use assets, net of $168.0 million and corresponding lease liabilities of $173.4 million. The adoption of Topic 842 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated statements of income or consolidated statements of cash flows.In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, ""Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income."" This standard allows entities to elect to reclassify the income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) on items within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. Effective June 1, 2019, Cintas adopted ASU 2018-02, on a prospective basis, which resulted in a $2.0 million reclassification adjustment of the stranded tax effects from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive loss that was determined using a specific identification method. In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” ASU 2016-13 will replace the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. In connection with recognizing credit losses on accounts receivable and other financial instruments, Cintas will be required to use a forward-looking expected loss model rather than the incurred loss model. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard will be through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. Cintas will adopt this standard on June 1, 2020, and the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.26In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.” ASU 2017-04 eliminates the two-step process that required identification of potential impairment and a separate measure of the actual impairment. Goodwill impairment charges, if any, would be determined by the difference between a reporting unit's carrying value and its fair value (impairment loss is limited to the carrying value). This standard was adopted by Cintas in the current fiscal year and did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),"" to clarify revenue recognition principles. This guidance is intended to improve disclosure requirements and enhance the comparability of revenue recognition practices. Improved disclosures under the amended guidance relate to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized from contracts with customers. We adopted ASU 2014-09, and all the related amendments, effective June 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. ASU 2014-09 requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Upon adoption of ASU 2014-09, we recorded an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of June 1, 2018. The adjustment to retained earnings primarily relates to the capitalization of certain direct and incremental contract costs required by the new guidance. Capitalized costs are amortized ratably over the anticipated period of benefit. We applied ASU 2014-09 only to contracts that were not completed prior to fiscal 2019. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and had no impact to the Company's operating cash flow.In March 2020, the SEC amended Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X regarding financial disclosure requirements for registered debt offerings involving subsidiaries as either issuers or guarantors and affiliates whose securities are pledged as collateral. This new guidance narrows the circumstances that require separate financial statements of subsidiary issuers and guarantors and streamlines the alternative disclosure required in lieu of those statements. We adopted these amendments for the year ended May 31, 2020. Accordingly, combined summarized financial information has been presented only for the issuer and guarantors of our senior notes for the most recent fiscal year and the year-to-date interim period, and the location of the required disclosures has been removed from the notes to the consolidated financial statements and moved to Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.No other new accounting pronouncement recently issued or newly effective had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of Cintas' consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with Note 1 entitled Significant Accounting Policies of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."" Significant changes, estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies, including those impacted by COVID-19, could possibly have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.Revenue recognitionRental revenue, which is recorded in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, is recognized when services are performed. Other revenue, which is recorded in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segments and All Other, is recognized when either services are performed or the obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. See Note 2 entitled Revenue Recognition of the ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for more information on Cintas' revenue. Uniforms and other rental items in serviceUniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization, calculated using the straight-line method. Uniforms in service (other than cleanroom and flame resistant clothing) are amortized over their useful life of 18 months. Other rental items, including shop towels, mats, mops, cleanroom garments, flame resistant clothing, linens and restroom dispensers, are amortized over their useful lives, which range from 8 to 60 months. The amortization rates used are based on industry experience, Cintas' specific experience and wear tests performed by Cintas. These factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory and related cost of uniforms and ancillary products that are presented in the consolidated financial statements.27Property and equipmentDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets based on industry and Cintas specific experience, which is typically 30 to 40 years for buildings, 5 to 20 years for building improvements, 3 to 10 years for equipment and 2 to 15 years for leasehold improvements. When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the carrying amount of the assets. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss is recorded based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is generally determined by discounted cash flows or based on prices of similar assets, as appropriate. As a result of certain restructuring activities to eliminate excess capacity and reduce our cost structure, an indicator of potential impairment was identified. Cintas recognized an impairment loss of $9.2 million during the year ended May 31, 2020, based on the excess of the carrying amount of assets over their respective fair values. The undiscounted cash flows were estimated, using Level 2 inputs based on both the cost and market approaches, at the lowest discernible level of cash flows, which is at the location level. Cintas did not identify any indicators of impairment for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2019 and 2018. GoodwillGoodwill, obtained through acquisitions of businesses, is valued at cost less any impairment. Cintas completes an annual impairment test, that includes an assessment of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance. In fiscal 2020, we identified the impact from COVID-19 as a qualitative factor that necessitated a quantitative analysis. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. Cintas has identified four reporting units for purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment: Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services and two reporting units within All Other. To test for goodwill impairment, using a quantitative analysis, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units using both a discounted cash flow valuation technique and a market-based approach. The impairment test is dependent upon a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment, margin expansion and our business plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. The most significant assumptions used in the determination of the estimated fair value of the reporting units are the revenue and EBITDA growth rates (including terminal growth rates) and the discount rate. The terminal growth rate represents the rate at which the reporting unit is expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The terminal growth rate utilized in our fair value estimate is consistent with the reporting unit operating plans and approximates expected long-term category market growth rates and inflation. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. The discount rates may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, specifically the COVID-19 pandemic, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other factors. Based on the results of the annual impairment tests, Cintas was not required to recognize an impairment of goodwill for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018. Cintas will continue to perform impairment tests as of March 1 in future years and when indicators of impairment exist.Service contracts and other assetsService contracts and other assets, which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses, are amortized by use of the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the agreements, which are generally 5 to 10 years. The G&K service contract asset is being amortized over a period of 15 years, which represents the estimated life of the economic benefit and the asset amortization is based on the annual economic value of the underlying asset, which generally decreases over the 15-year term. Certain noncompete agreements, as well as all service contracts, require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model. The assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates, among other factors. Because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets, actual results over time could vary from original estimates. Impairment of service contracts and other assets is accomplished through specific identification. No impairment has been recognized by Cintas for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.28Insurance reserveThe insurance reserve represents the estimated ultimate cost of all asserted and unasserted claims, primarily related to workers' compensation, auto liability and other general liability exposure through the consolidated balance sheet dates. Our reserves are estimated through actuarial procedures, with the assistance of third-party actuarial specialists, of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for specific expectations based on our claims history. Cintas records an increase or decrease in selling and administrative expenses related to development of prior claims, higher claims activity and other environmental factors in the period in which it becomes known. These changes in estimates may be material to the consolidated financial statements.Stock-based compensationCompensation expense is recognized for all share-based payments to employees, including stock options and restricted stock awards, in the consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of the awards that are granted. The fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Generally, measured compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the related share-based compensation award. See Note 12 entitled Stock-Based Compensation of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for further information.Litigation and other contingenciesCintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. U.S. GAAP requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. While a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities, Cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements.Income taxesDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Therefore, the Company has not recorded deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse in future periods. Cintas accounts for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) as a current-period expense when incurred. See Note 9 entitled Income Taxes of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes. Cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets, as adjusted for valuation allowances, will be realized. Accounting for uncertain tax positions requires the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Companies may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.Cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions, Cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate. Based on Cintas' evaluation of current tax positions, Cintas believes its tax related accruals are appropriate.29Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskEarnings may be affected by changes in short-term interest rates due to investments, if any, in marketable securities and money market accounts and periodic issuances of commercial paper. If short-term rates changed by one-half percent (or 50 basis points), Cintas' income before income taxes would change by approximately $0.4 million. This estimated exposure considers the effects on investments. This analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in Cintas' capital structure.Through its foreign operations, Cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk. Foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into U.S. dollars. Foreign denominated revenue and profit represents less than 10% of Cintas' consolidated revenue and profit. Cintas periodically uses foreign currency hedges such as average rate options and forward contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements resulting from foreign currency revenue and from international cash flows. The primary foreign currency to which Cintas is exposed is the Canadian dollar.30",2023-12-30 21:41:02.221345

For discussion of fiscal 2020 results compared to fiscal 2019 results, see the ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on July 29, 2020.Cintas classifies its business into two reportable operating segments and places the remainder of its operating segments in an All Other category. Cintas’ two reportable operating segments are Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing, mats, mops and shop towels and other ancillary items. In addition to these rental items, restroom cleaning services and supplies and the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route are included within this reportable operating segment. The First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment consists of first aid and safety products and services. The remainder of Cintas’ business, which consists of the Fire Protection Services operating segment and the Uniform Direct Sale operating segment, is included in All Other. These operating segments consist of fire protection products and services and the direct sale of uniforms and related items. Cintas evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and income before income taxes. Revenue and income before income taxes for each of these reportable operating segments for the years ended May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are presented in Note 14 entitled Operating Segment Information of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."" The Company regularly reviews its operating segments for reporting purposes based on the information its chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance and makes changes when appropriate.In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally. In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. Efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 intensified during our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter and have remained in effect throughout our fiscal 2021. Most states and municipalities within the U.S., as well as Canada, enacted temporary closures of businesses, issued quarantine orders and took other restrictive measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the business closures, quarantine orders and other restrictive measures remained in place through fiscal 2021. Within the U.S., our business was designated an essential business, which allowed us to continue to serve customers that remained open. During our fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, the roll out of vaccines, lower COVID-19 case counts and lifting of restrictions on businesses had a positive impact on our business. We have operations throughout the U.S. and Canada and participate in a global supply chain. During most of fiscal 2021, the existence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the fear associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the reactions of governments around the world in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to regulate the flow of labor and products and impede the business of our customers, impacted our ability to conduct normal business operations, which had an adverse effect on our business. Many of Cintas' customers were also impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we saw an impact on some customer's ability to pay timely. While there was minimal disruption to our supply chain, Cintas did increase inventory, primarily personal protective equipment and facility services inventory, in response to the customer needs and demand associated with the safety and cleanliness requirements of COVID-19. The increase in inventory resulted in additional inventory reserves during fiscal 2021 and could result in future inventory reserve increases if demand for personal protective equipment declines. See Note 1 entitled Significant Accounting Policies of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for additional detail on the additional reserve placed on inventory. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve, and therefore, we cannot predict the extent to which our business, consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial condition or liquidity will ultimately be impacted. 18The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percent of revenue by reportable operating segment, All Other and in total for the fiscal years ended May 31:202120202019Revenue: Uniform Rental and Facility Services80.0%79.7%80.6%First Aid and Safety Services11.0%10.0%9.0%All Other9.0%10.3%10.4%Total revenue100.0%100.0%100.0%Cost of sales: Uniform Rental and Facility Services52.4%54.1%54.5%First Aid and Safety Services57.6%52.2%52.0%All Other57.0%58.2%57.4%Total cost of sales53.4%54.4%54.6%Gross margin: Uniform Rental and Facility Services47.6%45.9%45.5%First Aid and Safety Services42.4%47.8%48.0%All Other43.0%41.8%42.6%Total gross margin46.6%45.6%45.4%Selling and administrative expenses:Uniform Rental and Facility Services26.0%28.1%27.6%First Aid and Safety Services32.0%32.7%33.4%All Other30.8%34.9%33.3%Total selling and administrative expenses27.1%29.2%28.7%G&K Services, Inc. integration expenses—%—%0.2%Gain on sale of a cost method investment—%—%1.0%Interest expense, net1.4%1.5%1.5%Income from continuing operations before income taxes18.1%14.9%16.0%Fiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020 Fiscal 2021 total revenue was $7.1 billion, an increase of 0.4% over the prior fiscal year. Revenue increased organically by 0.2% as a result of increased sales volume. Organic growth adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and workday differences. Total revenue was negatively impacted by a net 0.3% due to acquisitions and divestitures, positively impacted by 0.2% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and positively impacted by 0.3% due to one more workday in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. As previously discussed, government enactments of temporary and indefinite closures of certain businesses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our ability to access and service some of our customers impacted by these mandates during fiscal 2021. Due to the constantly changing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, uncertainty remains about the pace of the economic recovery and about its impact on future Cintas consolidated financial results. 19Organic revenue by quarter for fiscal 2021 is as follows: Organic RevenueFirst quarter ended August 31, 2020(5.0)%Second quarter ended November 30, 2020(4.4)%Third quarter ended February 28, 2021(0.1)%Fourth quarter ended May 31, 202111.5%For the fiscal year ended May 31, 20210.2%Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue consists predominantly of revenue derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms and other garments, including flame resistant clothing and the rental and/or sale of mats, mops, shop towels, restroom supplies and other rental services. Revenue from the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment increased 0.8% compared to fiscal 2020 due to an organic growth increase of 0.7%. Revenue growth was negatively impacted by a net 0.5% due to acquisitions and divestitures, positively impacted by 0.2% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and positively impacted by 0.4% due to one more workday in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. Revenue growth was a result of new business, the penetration of additional products and services into existing customers, partially offset by lost business. New business growth resulted from an increase in the productivity of sales representatives. Generally, sales productivity improvements are due to increased tenure and improved training, which produce a higher number of products and services sold. Other revenue, consisting of revenue from the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other, decreased 1.0% compared to fiscal 2020. Revenue improvement from increases in sales representative productivity and sales of personal protection equipment was more than offset by a decrease in sales related to customers in All Other as a result of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue declined organically by 1.9%. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 0.5% due to revenue growth derived through acquisitions in our First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and our Fire Protection operating segment, which is included in All Other, and by 0.4% due to one more workday in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. Cost of uniform rental and facility services decreased 2.3% compared to fiscal 2020. Cost of uniform rental and facility services consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory, including uniforms, mats, shop towels and other ancillary items. The cost of uniform rental and facility services decreased compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to certain cost control measures such as reduced labor and supplies that were partially offset by increases in material cost, primarily related to personal protective equipment. Cost of other consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly first aid and safety products, personal protective equipment, uniforms and fire protection products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other. Cost of other increased 2.8% in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of sales in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment of personal protective equipment, which typically have lower gross margins compared to other First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment products.Selling and administrative expenses decreased $141.9 million, to 27.1% as a percent of revenue, compared to 29.2% in fiscal 2020. The improvement as a percent of revenue was primarily due to efficiencies in labor and employee-partner related expenses as well as lower discretionary spending and a one-time benefit from the gain on the sale of certain operating assets. In addition, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, Cintas initiated certain one-time activities to reduce operating costs and better align its workforce with the needs of its ongoing business and recorded $24.5 million in employee termination costs and $9.2 million in long-lived asset impairment costs. Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) was $97.7 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $104.4 million in fiscal 2020. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to the decrease in total debt outstanding during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. 20Income before income taxes was $1,287.7 million, an increase of $229.5 million, or 21.7%, compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in income before income taxes was primarily due to both cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses decreasing in total and as a percent of revenue in fiscal 2021. Income before income taxes also benefited from a one-time net gain on the sale of certain operating assets.Cintas' effective tax rate on continuing operations was 13.7% for fiscal 2021 compared to 17.2% in fiscal 2020. The effective tax rate in both periods was impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. In addition, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 included a one-time tax benefit on the sale of certain operating assets.Net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2021 of $1,111.0 million was a 26.8% increase compared to fiscal 2020. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $10.24 was a 26.3% increase compared to fiscal 2020 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $8.11. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased primarily due to the increase in net income.Uniform Rental and Facility Services Reportable Operating SegmentUniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue increased $46.1 million, or 0.8%, and the cost of uniform rental and facility services decreased $71.6 million, or 2.3%, due to the reasons previously discussed. The reportable operating segment's fiscal 2021 gross margin was 47.6% of revenue compared to 45.9% in fiscal 2020. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to certain cost control measures such as reduced labor and supplies that were partially offset by increases in material cost, including increases related to increased sales of personal protective equipment.Selling and administrative expenses for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment decreased $103.5 million in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. Selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue for fiscal 2021 was 26.0% compared to 28.1% in fiscal 2020. The improvement in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue was primarily due to efficiencies in labor and employee-partner related expenses as well as lower discretionary spending and a one-time benefit from the gain on the sale of certain operating assets, which was partially offset by a one-time asset impairment on certain long-lived assets. Also, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment initiated certain one-time activities to reduce operating costs and better align its workforce with the needs of its ongoing business. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the reportable operating segment recorded $20.2 million in employee termination costs and $9.2 million in long-lived asset impairment costs. Income before income taxes increased $221.3 million to $1,225.8 million for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. Income before income taxes as a percent of revenue at 21.5% increased 370 basis points from 17.8% in fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to the previously discussed improvement in gross margin and selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue.First Aid and Safety Services Reportable Operating SegmentFirst Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment revenue increased $75.7 million in fiscal 2021, a 10.7% increase compared to fiscal 2020. Revenue increased organically by 10.0% as a result of new business and sales productivity increases, penetration of additional products and services into existing customers and sales of personal protective equipment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 0.2% due to acquisitions, by 0.1% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by 0.4% due to one more workday in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.Cost of sales for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment increased $82.0 million, or 22.2%, in fiscal 2021, primarily due to higher sales volume and change in sales mix. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment is defined as revenue less cost of goods, warehouse expenses, service expenses and training expenses. The gross margin as a percent of revenue was 42.4% for fiscal 2021 compared to 47.8% in fiscal 2020. The decrease was primarily a result of the increase in the proportion of sales related to personal protective equipment, as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Personal protective equipment typically has lower gross margins than other First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment products. 21Selling and administrative expenses for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment increased by $19.4 million, or 8.4%, in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, but improved as a percent of revenue to 32.0% in fiscal 2021 compared to 32.7% in fiscal 2020. The improvement as a percent of revenue was primarily due to revenue growing at a faster pace than labor and employee-partner related expenses and lower discretionary spending. Income before income taxes for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment was $81.2 million in fiscal 2021, a decrease of $25.7 million, or 24.1%, compared to fiscal 2020. Income before income taxes as a percent of revenue at 10.4%, decreased from 15.1% in fiscal 2020 due to the previously discussed decrease in gross margin.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe following table summarizes our cash flows and cash and cash equivalents as of and for the fiscal years ended May 31:(In thousands)20212020Net cash provided by operating activities$1,360,740 $1,291,483 Net cash used in investing activities$(137,215)$(285,398)Net cash used in financing activities$(879,868)$(955,207)Cash and cash equivalents at end of year$493,640 $145,402 Cash and cash equivalents as of May 31, 2021 and 2020 include $37.9 million and $30.2 million, respectively, that is located outside of the U.S. Cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. We generally use these cash flows to fund most, if not all, of our operations and expansion activities and dividends on our common stock. We may also use cash flows provided by operating activities, as well as proceeds from long-term debt and short-term borrowings, to fund growth and expansion opportunities, as well as other cash requirements such as the repurchase of our common stock and payment of long-term debt. The disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have an impact on Cintas' fiscal 2021 financial results. However, net cash flow provided by operating activities was not significantly impacted. We expect our cash flows from operating activities to remain sufficient to provide us with adequate levels of short-term liquidity. In addition, we have access to $1.0 billion of short-term debt from our revolving credit facility. Although the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve, we believe our long-term liquidity position remains strong. We believe the Company has sufficient liquidity to operate in the current business environment. Acquisitions and dividends remain strategic objectives, but they will be dependent on the economic outlook and liquidity of the Company. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.36 billion for fiscal 2021, which was an increase of $69.3 million compared to fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily the result of increased net income and favorable changes in accrued compensation and other, partially offset by changes in working capital, specifically income taxes, accounts receivable and accrued liabilities and other.Net cash used in investing activities was $137.2 million in fiscal 2021, compared to $285.4 million in fiscal 2020. Net cash used in investing activities includes capital expenditures, purchases of investments, proceeds from the sale of operating assets and cash paid for acquisitions of businesses. Capital expenditures were $143.5 million and $230.3 million for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 included $104.0 million for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment and $34.4 million for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment. The decrease in capital expenditures from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 was due to reduced growth capacity needs within the slower growth landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cash paid for acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, was $10.0 million and $53.7 million for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. The acquisitions in both fiscal 2021 and 2020 occurred in our Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, our First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and our Fire Protection operating segment, which is included in All Other. In fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, investing activities included proceeds of $31.7 million and $13.3 million, respectively, from the sale of certain operating assets, net of 22cash disposed. Net cash used in investing activities also included $4.3 million and $10.0 million of purchases of investments during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities was $879.9 million for fiscal 2021, compared to $955.2 million in fiscal 2020. The decrease in cash used from financing activities from fiscal 2020 is primarily due to the payment of the $312.5 million of debt in fiscal 2020, partially offset by an increase in cash used to pay dividends and repurchase common stock in fiscal 2021. On October 30, 2018, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion share buyback program, which was completed during fiscal 2021. On October 29, 2019, we announced the Board of Directors authorized a new $1.0 billion share buyback program, which does not have an expiration date.

From the inception of the October 29, 2019 program through July 28, 2021, Cintas purchased a total of 2.8 million shares of Cintas common stock at an average price of $358.93 per share for a total purchase price of $1.0 billion. In addition, for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, Cintas acquired 0.2 million shares of Cintas common stock in satisfaction of employee payroll taxes due on restricted stock awards that vested during the fiscal year. These shares were acquired at an average price of $302.52 per share for a total purchase price of $74.4 million. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020, Cintas acquired 0.3 million shares of Cintas common stock in satisfaction of employee payroll taxes due on restricted awards that vested during the fiscal year. These shares were acquired at an average price of $260.89 per share for a total purchase price of $68.8 million. On October 27, 2020, Cintas declared an annual cash dividend on outstanding common stock, representing a 10.2% increase over the annual dividend paid in the prior fiscal year. This marked the 38th consecutive year that Cintas has increased its annual dividend, every year since going public in 1983. Also on October 27, 2020, the Cintas Board of Directors approved a change in the dividend policy from an annual dividend to a quarterly dividend and subsequently declared a quarterly dividend on outstanding common stock. Any future dividend declarations, including the amount of any dividends, are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and dependent upon then-existing conditions, including the Company's consolidated operating results and consolidated financial condition, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, business prospects and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant.

The interest rate shown above is the effective interest rate. The principal amount of these notes is $50.0 million with a stated interest rate of 3.73%. (2) Cintas assumed these senior notes with the acquisition of G&K in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and they were recorded at fair value. The interest rate shown above is the effective interest rate. The principal amount of these notes is $50.0 million with a stated interest rate of 3.88%. The credit agreement that supports our commercial paper program was amended and restated on May 24, 2019. The amendment increased the capacity of the revolving credit facility from $600.0 million to $1.0 billion and created a new term loan of $200.0 million. The credit agreement has an accordion feature that provides Cintas the ability to request increases to the borrowing commitments under either the revolving credit facility or the term loan of up to $250.0 million in the aggregate, subject to customary conditions. The maturity date of the revolving credit facility is May 23, 2024. As of May 31, 2021 and 2020, there was no commercial paper outstanding and no borrowings on our credit facility. On June 1, 2021, in accordance with the terms of the notes, Cintas paid the $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.30%, 10-year senior notes that matured on that date with cash on hand. During fiscal 2022, Cintas expects to issue long-term debt to pay the $650.0 million principal amount of its 2.90%, 5-year senior notes that mature in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements. These covenants limit Cintas' ability to incur certain liens, to engage in sale-leaseback transactions and to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of Cintas' assets. These covenants also require Cintas to maintain certain debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and interest coverage ratios. Cross-default provisions exist between certain debt instruments. If a default of a significant covenant were to occur, the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness, impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital. Cintas was in compliance with all of the debt covenants for all periods presented. Our access to the commercial paper and long-term debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity. We do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past, including our ability to refinance the $650.0 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes that mature in fiscal 2022. Additionally, our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend, to a significant degree, on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness. 24As of May 31, 2021, our ratings were as follows:Rating AgencyOutlookCommercialPaperLong-termDebtStandard & Poor’sStableA-2A-Moody’s Investors ServiceStableP-2A3In the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding long-term debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason, or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of long-term debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above, particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings, our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected. In addition, in such a case, our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and long-term debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies. To monitor our credit rating and our capacity for long-term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. One such factor is the ratio of our total debt to EBITDA. For the purpose of this calculation, debt is defined as the sum of short-term borrowings, long-term debt due within one year, long-term debt and standby letters of credit. Financial and Nonfinancial Disclosure About Issuers and Guarantors of Cintas’ Senior NotesCintas Corporation No. 2 (Corp. 2) is the indirectly, wholly owned principal operating subsidiary of Cintas. Corp. 2 is the issuer of the $2,550.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding as of May 31, 2021, which are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Cintas Corporation and its wholly owned, direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries.

Management believes inflation has not had a material impact on Cintas' consolidated financial condition or a negative impact on the consolidated results of operations.26Litigation and Other ContingenciesCintas is subject to legal proceedings, insurance receipts, legal settlements and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary course of business actions will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows of Cintas. The Company, the Board of Directors, Scott Farmer (Executive Chairman) and the Investment Policy Committee are defendants in a purported class action, filed on December 13, 2019, pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio alleging violations of ERISA. The lawsuit asserts that the defendants improperly managed the costs of the employee retirement plan, breached their fiduciary duties in failing to investigate and select lower cost alternative funds and failed to monitor and control the employee retirement plan’s recordkeeping costs. The defendants deny liability.New Accounting StandardsIn April 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” ASU 2016-13 replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. In connection with recognizing credit losses on accounts receivable and other financial instruments, Cintas now uses a forward-looking expected loss model rather than the incurred loss model. Adoption of ASU 2016-13 requires using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date to align existing credit loss methodology with the new standard. This standard was adopted by Cintas on June 1, 2020 and did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. No other new accounting pronouncement recently issued or newly effective had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of Cintas' consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with Note 1 entitled Significant Accounting Policies of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."" Significant changes, estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies, including those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, could possibly have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.Revenue recognitionRental revenue, which is recorded in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, is recognized when services are performed or the obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. Other revenue, which is recorded in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segments and All Other, is recognized when either services are performed or the obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. See Note 2 entitled Revenue Recognition of the ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for more information on Cintas' revenue. Uniforms and other rental items in serviceUniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization, calculated using the straight-line method. Uniforms in service (other than cleanroom and flame resistant clothing) are amortized over their useful life of 18 months. Other rental items, including shop towels, mats, mops, cleanroom garments, flame resistant clothing, linens and restroom dispensers, are amortized over their useful lives, which range from 8 to 60 months. The amortization rates used are based on industry experience, Cintas' specific experience and wear tests performed by Cintas. These factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory and related cost of uniforms and ancillary products that are presented in the consolidated financial statements.27GoodwillGoodwill, obtained through acquisitions of businesses, is valued at cost less any impairment. Cintas completes an annual impairment test, that includes an assessment of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. Cintas has identified four reporting units for purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment: Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services and two reporting units within All Other. Based on the results of the annual impairment tests, Cintas was not required to recognize an impairment of goodwill for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019. Cintas will continue to perform impairment tests as of March 1 in future years and when indicators of impairment exist.Insurance reserveThe insurance reserve represents the estimated ultimate cost of all asserted and unasserted claims, primarily related to workers' compensation, auto liability and other general liability exposure through the consolidated balance sheet dates. Our incurred but not reported reserves are estimated through actuarial procedures, with the assistance of third-party actuarial specialists, of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for specific expectations based on our claims history. Cintas records an increase or decrease in selling and administrative expenses related to development of prior claims, higher claims activity and other environmental factors in the period in which it becomes known. These changes in estimates may be material to the consolidated financial statements.Stock-based compensationCompensation expense is recognized for all share-based payments to employees, including stock options and restricted stock awards, in the consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of the awards that are granted. The fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Generally, measured compensation cost, net of actual forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the related share-based compensation award. See Note 12 entitled Stock-Based Compensation of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for further information.Litigation and other contingenciesCintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. U.S. GAAP requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. While a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities, Cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements.Income taxesDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Therefore, the Company has not recorded deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse in future periods. Cintas accounts for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) as a current-period expense when incurred. See Note 9 entitled Income Taxes of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes. Cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets, as adjusted for valuation allowances, will be realized. Accounting for uncertain tax positions requires the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Companies may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.28Cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions, Cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate. Based on Cintas' evaluation of current tax positions, Cintas believes its tax related accruals are appropriate.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskEarnings may be affected by changes in short-term interest rates due to investments, if any, in marketable securities and money market accounts and periodic issuances of commercial paper. If short-term rates changed by one-half percent (or 50 basis points), Cintas' income before income taxes would change by approximately $0.5 million. This estimated exposure considers the effects on investments. This analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in Cintas' capital structure.Through its foreign operations, Cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk. Foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into U.S. dollars. Foreign denominated revenue and profit represents less than 10% of Cintas' consolidated revenue and profit. Cintas periodically uses foreign currency hedges such as average rate options and forward contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements resulting from foreign currency revenue and from international cash flows. The primary foreign currency to which Cintas is exposed is the Canadian dollar.29",2023-12-30 21:41:05.931531

For discussion of fiscal 2021 results compared to fiscal 2020 results, see the ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” within our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on July 28, 2021.Cintas classifies its business into two reportable operating segments and places the remainder of its operating segments in an All Other category. Cintas’ two reportable operating segments are Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing, mats, mops and shop towels and other ancillary items. In addition to these rental items, restroom cleaning services and supplies and the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route are included within this reportable operating segment. The First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment consists of first aid and safety products and services. The remainder of Cintas’ business, which consists of the Fire Protection Services operating segment and the Uniform Direct Sale operating segment, is included in All Other. These operating segments consist of fire protection products and services and the direct sale of uniforms and related items. Cintas evaluates operating segment performance based on revenue and income before income taxes. Revenue and income before income taxes for the reportable operating segments for the years ended May 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are presented in Note 15 entitled Operating Segment Information of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."" The Company regularly reviews its operating segments for reporting purposes based on the information its chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance and makes changes when appropriate.19We have operations throughout the U.S. and Canada and participate in a global supply chain. Since fiscal 2020, the existence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the fear associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the reactions of governments around the world in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to regulate the flow of labor and products and impede the business of our customers, impacted our ability to conduct normal business operations, which had an adverse effect on our business. Many of Cintas' customers were also impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and we saw an impact on some customer's ability to pay timely. While there was minimal disruption to our supply chain, Cintas did increase inventory, primarily personal protective equipment and facility services inventory, in response to the customer needs and demand associated with the safety and cleanliness requirements of COVID-19. The increase in inventory resulted in additional inventory reserves during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021. See Note 1 entitled Significant Accounting Policies of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for additional detail on the incremental reserves placed on inventory. The on-going roll out of the COVID-19 vaccines and gradual lifting of COVID-19 restrictions had a positive impact on our business during fiscal 2022. The impact of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve, and therefore, we cannot predict the extent to which our business, consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial condition or liquidity will ultimately be impacted.The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percent of revenue by reportable operating segment, All Other and in total for the fiscal years ended May 31:20222021Revenue: Uniform Rental and Facility Services79.3%80.0%First Aid and Safety Services10.6%11.0%All Other10.1%9.0%Total revenue100.0%100.0%Cost of sales: Uniform Rental and Facility Services53.3%52.4%First Aid and Safety Services55.3%57.6%All Other56.0%57.0%Total cost of sales53.8%53.4%Gross margin: Uniform Rental and Facility Services46.7%47.6%First Aid and Safety Services44.7%42.4%All Other44.0%43.0%Total gross margin46.2%46.6%Selling and administrative expenses:Uniform Rental and Facility Services25.0%26.0%First Aid and Safety Services31.9%32.0%All Other28.0%30.8%Total selling and administrative expenses26.0%27.1%Interest expense, net1.1%1.4%Income from continuing operations before income taxes19.1%18.1%Fiscal 2022 Compared to Fiscal 2021 Fiscal 2022 total revenue was $7.9 billion, an increase of 10.4% over the prior fiscal year. Revenue increased organically by 10.2% as a result of increased sales volume. Organic growth adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Total revenue was positively impacted by 0.1% due primarily to acquisitions and by 0.1% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 20As previously discussed, government enactments of temporary and indefinite closures of certain businesses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our ability to access and service some of our customers impacted by these mandates during fiscal 2021. The roll out of the COVID-19 vaccines and general lifting of COVID-19 restrictions had a positive impact on our business during fiscal 2022. Due to the constantly changing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, uncertainty remains about the pace of the economic recovery and about its impact on future Cintas consolidated financial results. Organic revenue growth by quarter for fiscal 2022 is as follows: Organic GrowthFirst quarter ended August 31, 20218.6%Second quarter ended November 30, 20219.3%Third quarter ended February 28, 202210.0%Fourth quarter ended May 31, 202212.7%For the fiscal year ended May 31, 202210.2%Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue consists predominantly of revenue derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms and other garments, including flame resistant clothing and the rental and/or sale of mats, mops, shop towels, restroom supplies and other rental services. Revenue from the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment increased 9.4% compared to fiscal 2021 due to an organic growth increase of 9.0%. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 0.2% due primarily to acquisitions and by 0.2% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Organic revenue growth was a result of new business, the penetration of additional products and services into existing customers, the positive impact from the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and price increases, partially offset by lost business. New business growth resulted from an increase in the number and productivity of sales representatives. Generally, sales productivity improvements are due to increased tenure and improved training, which produce a higher number of products and services sold. Other revenue, consisting of revenue from the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other, increased 14.1% compared to fiscal 2021. Revenue improved from increases in sales representative productivity and from the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions. Revenue increased organically by 14.9%. Revenue growth was negatively impacted by 0.8% due to divestitures.Cost of uniform rental and facility services increased 11.2% compared to fiscal 2021. Cost of uniform rental and facility services consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory, including uniforms, mats, shop towels and other ancillary items. The cost of uniform rental and facility services as a percent of revenue increased compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to increased energy costs and investments in labor to support the increased revenue growth.Cost of other consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly first aid and safety products, personal protective equipment, uniforms and fire protection products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and All Other. Cost of other increased 10.7% in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, but decreased as a percent of revenue to 55.7%, compared to 57.3% in fiscal 2021. The improvement in cost of sales as a percent to revenue was primarily due to favorable changes in the sales mix for each of the underlying operating segments, including a decrease in the proportion of sales related to personal protective equipment, which typically have lower gross margins compared to the first aid cabinet sales in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment. Selling and administrative expenses increased $115.7 million, to 26.0% as a percent of revenue, compared to 27.1% in fiscal 2021. The improvement as a percent of revenue was primarily due to lower labor expense as a percent of revenue as well as a $12.1 million gain on the sale of certain operating assets and a $30.2 million gain on an equity method investment transaction recorded in fiscal 2022. The impacts from the gains recorded in fiscal 2022 were partially offset by the $22.0 million gain on the sale of certain operating assets recorded in fiscal 2021. Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) was $88.6 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $97.7 million in fiscal 2021. The change was primarily due to the replacement of the $250.0 million of senior notes with an interest rate of 4.30% that matured on June 1, 2021, with lower interest rate bearing commercial paper. 21Income before income taxes was $1,498.8 million, an increase of $211.0 million, or 16.4%, compared to fiscal 2021. The increase in income before income taxes was primarily due to revenue growth and the decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue in fiscal 2022. Income before income taxes also benefited from the previously mentioned one-time gains recorded in fiscal 2022. Cintas' effective tax rate on continuing operations was 17.5% for fiscal 2022 compared to 13.7% in fiscal 2021. The effective tax rate in both periods was impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. In addition, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 and 2021 included tax benefits from a gain on an equity method investment transaction in fiscal 2022 and the sale of certain operating assets in both fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021. Net income from continuing operations for fiscal 2022 of $1,235.8 million was a 11.2% increase compared to fiscal 2021. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $11.65 was a 13.8% increase compared to fiscal 2021 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $10.24. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased primarily due to the increase in net income combined with the decrease in diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. The decrease in diluted weighted average common shares outstanding resulted from purchasing an aggregate of approximately 3.7 million shares of common stock under the Board approved share buyback programs during fiscal 2022. Uniform Rental and Facility Services Reportable Operating SegmentUniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment revenue increased $537.3 million, or 9.4%, and the cost of uniform rental and facility services increased $332.9 million, or 11.2%, due to the reasons previously discussed. The reportable operating segment's fiscal 2022 gross margin was 46.7% of revenue compared to 47.6% in fiscal 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a 50 basis point increase in energy costs and investments in labor to support the increased revenue growth.Selling and administrative expenses for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment increased $76.8 million in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue for fiscal 2022 was 25.0% compared to 26.0% in fiscal 2021. The improvement in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue was primarily due to efficiencies in labor and the previously mentioned one-time gain of $30.2 million on an equity method investment transaction. Income before income taxes increased $127.7 million to $1,353.5 million for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Income before income taxes as a percent of revenue at 21.7% increased 20 basis points from 21.5% in fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily due to the previously discussed improvement in selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by decreases in gross margin as a percent of revenue.First Aid and Safety Services Reportable Operating SegmentFirst Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment revenue increased $48.2 million in fiscal 2022, a 6.1% increase compared to fiscal 2021. Revenue increased organically by 5.1% as a result of new business and sales productivity increases, penetration of additional products and services into existing customers and sales of personal protective equipment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue growth was positively impacted by 0.9% due to acquisitions and by 0.1% due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.Cost of sales for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment increased $8.3 million, or 1.8%, in fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher sales volume. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment is defined as revenue less cost of goods, warehouse expenses and service expenses. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 44.7% for fiscal 2022 compared to 42.4% in fiscal 2021. The improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportion of sales related to personal protective equipment, which typically have lower gross margins compared to the first aid cabinet sales.Selling and administrative expenses for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment increased by $14.3 million, or 5.7%, in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, and improved as a percent of revenue to 31.9% in fiscal 2022 compared to 32.0% in fiscal 2021. The improvement as a percent of revenue was primarily due to revenue growing at a faster pace than labor and employee-partner related expenses.22Income before income taxes for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment was $106.8 million in fiscal 2022, an increase of $25.6 million, or 31.5%, compared to fiscal 2021. Income before income taxes as a percent of revenue at 12.8%, increased from 10.4% in fiscal 2021 due to the previously discussed increases, primarily in gross margin.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe following table summarizes our cash flows and cash and cash equivalents as of and for the fiscal years ended May 31:(In thousands)20222021Net cash provided by operating activities$1,537,625 $1,360,740 Net cash used in investing activities$(402,635)$(137,215)Net cash used in financing activities$(1,537,943)$(879,868)Cash and cash equivalents at end of year$90,471 $493,640 Cash and cash equivalents as of May 31, 2022 and 2021 include $43.1 million and $37.9 million, respectively, that is located outside of the U.S. Cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity.

We may also use cash flows provided by operating activities, as well as proceeds from long-term debt and short-term borrowings, to fund growth and expansion opportunities, as well as other cash requirements such as the repurchase of our common stock and payment of long-term debt. We expect our cash flows from operating activities to remain sufficient to provide us with adequate levels of liquidity. In addition, we have access to $2.0 billion of debt capacity from our amended and restated revolving credit facility, the maturity of which was extended on March 23, 2022 until March 23, 2027. We believe the Company has sufficient liquidity to operate in the current business environment. Acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and dividends remain strategic objectives, but they will be dependent on the economic outlook and liquidity of the Company.Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.54 billion for fiscal 2022, which was an increase of $176.9 million, or 13.0%, compared to fiscal 2021. The increase was primarily the result of increased net income which was partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital, specifically, accounts receivable and uniforms and other rental items in service, which resulted from the growth in revenue. In addition, we had a favorable change in inventories, net, which was the result of a large amount of inventory purchases in the prior fiscal year period related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including sanitizer, sanitizer stands, masks and gloves.Net cash used in investing activities was $402.6 million in fiscal 2022, compared to $137.2 million in fiscal 2021. Net cash used in investing activities includes capital expenditures, purchases of investments, proceeds from the sale of operating assets and cash paid for acquisitions of businesses. Capital expenditures were $240.7 million and $143.5 million for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 included $166.6 million for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment and $59.7 million for the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment. The increase in capital expenditures from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2022 was due to an investment in the operating segments to support continued market penetration and revenue growth. Cash paid for acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, was $164.2 million and $10.0 million for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. The acquisitions in both fiscal 2022 and 2021 occurred in our Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, our First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segment and our Fire Protection operating segment, which is included in All Other. The fiscal 2022 acquisitions also includes the acquisition of the remaining interest of an equity method investment. In fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, investing activities included proceeds of $15.3 million and $31.7 million, respectively, from the sale of certain operating assets, net of cash disposed. Net cash used in investing activities also included $6.1 million and $4.3 million of purchases of investments during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. 23Net cash used in financing activities was $1,537.9 million for fiscal 2022, compared to $879.9 million in fiscal 2021. The increase in cash used from financing activities from fiscal 2021 is primarily due to the increase in repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2022, offset by the $261.2 million net issuance of commercial paper and the $76.2 million higher dividends paid in fiscal 2021 due to the transition from an annual dividend payment in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 to quarterly dividend payments thereafter. On October 30, 2018, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion share buyback program, which was completed during fiscal 2021. On October 29, 2019, we announced the Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion share buyback program, which was completed during fiscal 2022. On July 27, 2021, we announced the Board of Directors authorized a new $1.5 billion share buyback program, which does not have an expiration date.

From the inception of the July 27, 2021 share buyback program through July 27, 2022, Cintas has purchased 2.7 million shares of Cintas common stock in the aggregate, at an average price of $385.66, for a total purchase price of $1.0 billion.Our Board of Directors declared the following dividends during the fiscal years ended May 31: Declaration Date(In millions except per share data)Record DatePayment DateDividendPer ShareAmountFiscal Year 2022July 27, 2021August 13, 2021September 15, 2021$0.95 $98.8 October 26, 2021November 15, 2021December 15, 20210.95 99.1 January 12, 2022February 15, 2022March 15, 20220.95 98.2 April 12, 2022 (2)May 16, 2022June 15, 20220.95 97.5 Total$3.80 $393.6 Fiscal Year 2021October 27, 2020 (1)November 6, 2020December 4, 2020$2.81 $297.7 October 27, 2020November 6, 2020December 4, 20200.70 74.1 January 19, 2021February 15, 2021March 15, 20210.75 79.5 April 13, 2021 (2)May 15, 2021June 15, 20210.75 79.2 Total$5.01 $530.5 (1) Beginning October 27, 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a change in dividend policy from an annual dividend to quarterly dividends.(2) The dividends declared on April 12, 2022 and April 13, 2021 were included in current accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at May 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 24Any future dividend declarations, including the amount of any dividends, are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and dependent upon then-existing conditions, including the Company's consolidated operating results and consolidated financial condition, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, business prospects and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022, Cintas issued a net total of $261.2 million of commercial paper. There was no commercial paper outstanding during fiscal 2021. On June 1, 2021, in accordance with the terms of the notes, Cintas paid the $250.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 4.30%, 10-year senior notes that matured on that date with cash on hand. On April 1, 2022, in accordance with the terms of the notes, Cintas paid the $650.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 2.90%, 5-year senior notes that matured on that date with proceeds from short-term borrowings. On May 1, 2022, Cintas redeemed at par value the $300.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 3.25%, 10-year senior notes 30 days in advance of the maturation date with proceeds from short-term borrowings. On May 3, 2022, Cintas issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that bear an interest rate of 3.45% and mature on May 1, 2025. On May 3, 2022, Cintas also issued $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that bear an interest rate of 4.00% and mature on May 1, 2032. The net proceeds from these issuances were utilized for general business purposes, including reducing Cintas’ short-term borrowings.

(G&K) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and they were recorded at fair value. The interest rate shown above is the effective interest rate. The principal amount of these notes is $50.0 million with a stated interest rate of 3.73%. (3) Cintas assumed these senior notes with the acquisition of G&K in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and they were recorded at fair value. The interest rate shown above is the effective interest rate. The principal amount of these notes is $50.0 million with a stated interest rate of 3.88%. The credit agreement that supports our commercial paper program was amended and restated on March 23, 2022. The amendment increased the capacity of the revolving credit facility from $1.0 billion to $2.0 billion. The credit agreement has an accordion feature that provides Cintas the ability to request increases to the borrowing commitments under the revolving credit facility of up to $500.0 million in the aggregate, subject to customary conditions. The maturity date of the revolving credit facility is March 23, 2027. As of May 31, 2022, there was $261.2 25million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 1.20% and maturity dates less than 120 days and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility. As of May 31, 2021, there was no commercial paper outstanding and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Subsequent to May 31, 2022, in June 2022, Cintas borrowed $125.0 million under the revolving credit facility to fund short-term operating needs and repaid the amount later in June 2022. Cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements. These covenants limit Cintas' ability to incur certain liens, to engage in sale-leaseback transactions and to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of Cintas' assets. These covenants also require Cintas to maintain certain debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and interest coverage ratios. Cross-default provisions exist between certain debt instruments. If a default of a significant covenant were to occur, the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness, impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital. Cintas was in compliance with all of the debt covenants for all periods presented. Our access to the commercial paper and long-term debt markets has historically provided us with sources of both short-term and long-term liquidity to meet material cash obligations. We do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past. Additionally, our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and long-term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend, to a significant degree, on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness. As of May 31, 2022, our ratings were as follows:Rating AgencyOutlookCommercialPaperLong-termDebtStandard & Poor’sStableA-2A-Moody’s Investors ServiceStableP-2A3In the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding long-term debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason, or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of long-term debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above, particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings, our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected. In addition, in such a case, our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and long-term debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies. To monitor our credit rating and our capacity for long-term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. One such factor is the ratio of our total debt to EBITDA. For the purpose of this calculation, debt is defined as the sum of short-term borrowings, long-term debt due within one year, long-term debt and standby letters of credit. Financial and Nonfinancial Disclosure About Issuers and Guarantors of Cintas’ Senior NotesCintas Corporation No. 2 (Corp. 2) is the indirectly, wholly owned principal operating subsidiary of Cintas. Corp. 2 is the issuer of the $2,550.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding as of May 31, 2022, which are unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Cintas Corporation and its wholly owned, direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries. See Note 7 entitled Debt and Derivatives of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for more information on Cintas' outstanding debt. Basis of Preparation of the Summarized Financial InformationThe following tables include summarized financial information of Cintas Corporation (Issuer), Corp. 2 and subsidiary guarantors (together, the Obligor Group). Investments in and equity in the earnings of non-guarantors, which are not members of the Obligor Group, have been excluded. Non-guarantor subsidiaries are located outside the U.S., and therefore, excluded from the Obligor Group.26The summarized financial information of the Obligor Group is presented on a combined basis with intercompany balances and transactions between entities in the Obligor Group eliminated. The Obligor Group’s amounts due from, amounts due to and transactions with non-guarantors have been presented in separate line items, if they are material.

Cintas also makes payments to defined contribution plans and may make payments to defined benefit plans to satisfy minimum funding requirements. The amount of contributions made to the defined contribution plans are at the discretion of the Board of Directors of Cintas. Future contributions to the defined contribution plans are expected to be $92.8 million in the next year, $199.8 million in the next two to three years and $220.3 million in the next four to five years. Future contributions to the defined benefit plans are expected to be $0.0 million in the next year, $2.5 million in the next two to three years and $3.0 million in the next four to five years. 27Other CommitmentsAmount of Commitment Expiration per Period(In thousands)TotalOne yearor lessTwo tothree yearsFour tofive yearsAfter fiveyearsLines of credit (1)$1,738,037 $— $— $1,738,037 $— Standby letters of credit and surety bonds (2)106,687 106,687 — — — Total other commitments$1,844,724 $106,687 $— $1,738,037 $— (1)Back-up facility for the commercial paper program (reference Note 7 entitled Debt and Derivatives of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for further discussion).(2)These standby letters of credit and surety bonds support certain outstanding debt (reference Note 7 entitled Debt and Derivatives of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements""), self-insured workers' compensation and general liability insurance programs.Inflation and Changing PricesChanges in wages, benefits and energy costs have the potential to materially impact Cintas' consolidated results of operations. In fiscal 2022, we experienced significant impacts from inflation, including, but not limited to, higher labor, fuel and transportation costs. Management has been able to mitigate these inflationary pressures through pricing and various efficiency initiatives. Management has mitigated these impacts such that net of the mitigation strategy and initiatives, inflation and changing prices has not had a material impact on Cintas' consolidated financial condition or a negative impact on the consolidated results of operations. Litigation and Other ContingenciesCintas is subject to legal proceedings, insurance receipts, legal settlements and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary course of business actions will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows of Cintas. The Company, the Board of Directors, Scott Farmer (Executive Chairman) and the Investment Policy Committee are defendants in a purported class action, filed on December 13, 2019, pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio alleging violations of ERISA. The lawsuit asserts that the defendants improperly managed the costs of the employee retirement plan, breached their fiduciary duties in failing to investigate and select lower cost alternative funds and failed to monitor and control the employee retirement plan’s recordkeeping costs. The defendants deny liability.New Accounting StandardsIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. ASU 2019-12 is part of the FASB’s overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of applying accounting standards while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740), in order to reduce the cost and complexity of its application in the areas of intraperiod tax allocation, deferred tax liabilities related to outside basis differences, year-to-date losses in interim periods and other areas within ASC 740. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 on June 1, 2021. The adoption of ASU 2019-12 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated condensed financial statements currently but may in future periods. No other new accounting pronouncement recently issued or newly effective had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.28Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of Cintas' consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with Note 1 entitled Significant Accounting Policies of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."" Significant changes, estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies, including those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, could possibly have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.Revenue recognitionRental revenue, which is recorded in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services reportable operating segment, is recognized when services are performed or the obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. Other revenue, which is recorded in the First Aid and Safety Services reportable operating segments and All Other, is recognized when either services are performed or the obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. See Note 2 entitled Revenue Recognition of the ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for more information on Cintas' revenue. Uniforms and other rental items in serviceUniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization, calculated using the straight-line method. Uniforms in service (other than cleanroom and flame resistant clothing) are amortized over their useful life of 18 months. Other rental items, including shop towels, mats, mops, cleanroom garments, flame resistant clothing, linens and restroom dispensers, are amortized over their useful lives, which range from 8 to 60 months. The amortization rates used are based on industry experience, Cintas' specific experience and wear tests performed by Cintas. These factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory and related cost of uniforms and ancillary products that are presented in the consolidated financial statements.GoodwillGoodwill, obtained through acquisitions of businesses, is valued at cost less any impairment. Cintas completes an annual impairment test, that includes an assessment of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. Cintas has identified four reporting units for purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment: Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services and two reporting units within All Other. Based on the results of the annual impairment tests, Cintas was not required to recognize an impairment of goodwill for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020. Cintas will continue to perform impairment tests as of March 1 in future years and when indicators of impairment exist.Insurance reserveThe insurance reserve represents the estimated ultimate cost of all asserted and unasserted claims, primarily related to workers' compensation, auto liability and other general liability exposure through the consolidated balance sheet dates. Our incurred but not reported reserves are estimated through actuarial procedures, with the assistance of third-party actuarial specialists, of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for specific expectations based on our claims history. Cintas records an increase or decrease in selling and administrative expenses related to development of prior claims, higher claims activity and other environmental factors in the period in which it becomes known. These changes in estimates may be material to the consolidated financial statements.Stock-based compensationCompensation expense is recognized for all share-based payments to employees, including stock options and restricted stock awards, in the consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of the awards that are granted. The fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Generally, measured compensation cost, net of actual forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the related share-based compensation award. See Note 13 entitled Stock-Based Compensation of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for further information.Litigation and other contingenciesCintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. U.S. GAAP requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be 29reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. While a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities, Cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements.Income taxesDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. See Note 9 entitled Income Taxes of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes. Cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets, as adjusted for valuation allowances, will be realized. Accounting for uncertain tax positions requires the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Companies may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.Cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions, Cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate. Based on Cintas' evaluation of current tax positions, Cintas believes its tax related accruals are appropriate.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskEarnings may be affected by changes in short-term interest rates due to investments, if any, in marketable securities and money market accounts and periodic issuances of commercial paper. If short-term rates changed by one-half percent (or 50 basis points), Cintas' income before income taxes would change by approximately $1.4 million. This estimated exposure considers the effects on investments. This analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in Cintas' capital structure.Through its foreign operations, Cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk. Foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into U.S. dollars. Foreign denominated revenue and profit represents less than 10% of Cintas' consolidated revenue and profit.30",2023-12-30 21:41:06.248660

723254,CTAS,CINTAS CORP,2004,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BUSINESS STRATEGY We are North America’s leading provider of corporate identity uniforms through rental and sales programs, as well as related business services, including entrance mats, restroom products, first aid and safety products and services, document management services and cleanroom services. Our services are designed to enhance our customers’ images and to provide additional safety and protection in the workplace. Our business strategy is to increase our market share of the uniform rental and sales business in North America through the sale of new uniform programs and to provide our customers with all of the products and services we offer. We will also continue to identify additional product and service opportunities to provide to our current and future customers. Our long-term goal is to provide a product or service to every business in North America. To pursue this strategy, we focus on the development of a highly talented and diverse team of employees (who we call partners) – a team that is properly trained and motivated to service our customers. We support our partners’ service efforts by providing superior products with distinct competitive advantages and we embrace technological advances. Continuous cost containment and product and process innovation are considered hallmarks of our organization. A more formalized approach in these areas was recently initiated when we commenced a Six Sigma effort within Cintas. Six Sigma is an analytical process that assists companies in improving quality and customer satisfaction while reducing cycle time and operating costs. We are pleased with our progress in this endeavor and are optimistic about the improved efficiencies that this process will yield to Cintas. We continue to leverage our size and core competencies to become a more valued business service provider to our current and future customers. We will also continue to supplement our internal growth with strategic acquisitions and the cultivation of new businesses. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal 2004 marked the 35th consecutive year of uninterrupted growth in sales and profits for Cintas. In addition to achieving this milestone, Cintas experienced healthy improvements in profitability, cash flow and balance sheet strength. This was accomplished while finalizing the integration of the largest uniform rental acquisition in Cintas’ history, Omni Services, Inc. (Omni). Cintas classifies its businesses into two operating segments: Rentals and Other Services. The Rentals operating segment designs and manufactures corporate identity uniforms which it rents, along with other items, to its customers. The Other Services operating segment involves the design, manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to customers as well as the sale of ancillary products and services. These ancillary products and services include restroom supplies, first aid and safety products and services, document management services and cleanroom supplies. All of these services are provided throughout the United States and Canada to businesses of all types - from small service and manufacturing companies to major corporations that employ thousands of people. 8 The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of revenue by reporting segment and in total for the periods indicated: 2004 2003 2002 Revenue: Rentals 78.2 % 78.2 % 77.2 % Other services 21.8 % 21.8 % 22.8 % Total revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales: Rentals 55.5 % 55.8 % 54.4 % Other services 66.1 % 67.3 % 69.6 % Total cost of sales 57.8 % 58.3 % 57.8 % Gross margin: Rentals 44.5 % 44.2 % 45.6 % Other services 33.9 % 32.7 % 30.4 % Total gross margin 42.2 % 41.7 % 42.2 % Selling and administrative expenses 25.9 % 25.9 % 25.6 % Interest income -0.1 % -0.1 % -0.3 % Interest expense 0.9 % 1.2 % 0.5 % Write-off of loan receivable 0.1 % — — Income before income taxes 15.4 % 14.7 % 16.4 % As evidenced above, our revenue growth has been consistent between our reporting segments, with Rentals and Other Services each accounting for a consistent percentage of revenue the past two fiscal years. We have increased our gross margins in both segments in fiscal 2004, while maintaining selling and administrative costs as a percent of revenues. This overall income improvement occurred despite the soft economy that existed for much of the year and the continued rise in fuel, wage and benefit costs. FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003 Fiscal 2004 total revenue was $2.8 billion, an increase of 4.7% over fiscal 2003. This growth was achieved despite the difficult economic environment that existed for much of the year. Internal growth for fiscal 2004, when adjusted for the additional workday in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, was 3.0%. Weakness in employment numbers through the first half of our fiscal year directly affected our business, mainly through reduced uniform wearers and usage of related products, and caused our internal growth rate to be lower than our stated objective. As employment numbers strengthened over the second half of the year, our internal growth rates improved. Internal growth by quarter is shown in the table below. Internal growth percentages have been adjusted for the appropriate number of work days, by quarter and for the year, where applicable. Internal Growth First Quarter Ending August 31, 2003 1.1 % Second Quarter Ending November 30, 2003 2.3 % Third Quarter Ending February 29, 2004 3.7 % Fourth Quarter Ending May 31, 2004 5.0 % For the Year Ending May 31, 2004 3.0 % 9 Historically, increases in our internal growth rate have lagged employment growth levels as customers add individuals to existing rental or sales programs or enter into new rental or sales programs. Our organic growth continues to be generated mainly through the continued sale of new uniform rental programs and the increased penetration of ancillary products to our existing customer base. The remaining growth in total revenue was generated predominantly through acquisitions of first aid and safety service businesses and document management businesses. Rentals operating segment revenues consist predominantly of revenues derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms, mats, shop towels and other rental services. Revenue from the Rentals segment increased 4.3%, when adjusted for the extra workday that occurred in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003. Internal revenue growth for the Rentals segment was 4.2%, adjusted for the additional workday. The amount of acquired rental volume was insignificant for the year ending May 31, 2004. The increase in Rentals revenue was primarily due to growth in the customer base as well as the continued penetration of ancillary products into our existing customer base. New business remained healthy as we experienced continued success in selling uniform rental programs to new customers. We continue to expand our rental market, with over half of our new business being comprised of customers who were first time users of uniform rental programs. Rentals revenue growth was mitigated by lost business and reductions in existing business attributable to the sluggish economy, especially during the first half of the year. Other Services operating segment revenues are predominantly derived from the design, manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to our customers and the sale of other direct sale products and services. Other direct sale products and services include restroom and cleanroom supplies, first aid and safety products and services and document management services. Other Services revenue increased 4.4%, when adjusted for the extra workday that occurred in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, primarily due to acquisitions of first aid and safety services and document management businesses. Internal revenue in the Other Services segment, adjusted for the additional workday in fiscal 2004, decreased by 1.3% for the year. This decrease was mainly due to the continued difficulty experienced by our uniform direct sale customers in the hospitality and airline industries. Weakness in the hospitality sector and delayed purchases by large national account customers has continued to impact our direct sales effort. Partially offsetting this internal revenue decrease in uniform direct sale revenues were increased revenues from the sale of first aid products and services and document management services. Cost of rentals increased 4.2% over fiscal 2003. Cost of rentals consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory, including uniforms and other rental items. The cost increase over fiscal 2003 was primarily driven by the growth in Rentals segment revenues. An increase in fuel and energy costs and a rise in labor delivery costs also contributed to this increase. Further assimilation of operations obtained through the Omni acquisition and various cost containment initiatives implemented throughout the year mitigated the increased fuel, energy and delivery costs. Cost of other services increased 2.8% over fiscal 2003. Cost of other services consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly uniforms and first aid products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses. The increase over fiscal 2003 was due to the growth in Other Services revenue, derived predominantly through acquisitions. The increased volume afforded additional overhead coverage, thereby providing a decrease in cost of other services as a percent to Other Services revenue from 67% in fiscal 2003 to 66% in fiscal 2004. Sourcing and manufacturing efficiencies and other cost containment initiatives, including Six Sigma initiatives, implemented throughout the year supported this reduction in cost of other services as a percent to Other Services revenue. Selling and administrative expenses increased 4.6% over fiscal 2003, primarily due to increased revenues. The continued rise in medical costs and increased legal expenses contributed to the increase. Net interest expense decreased $6 million from the prior year. This decrease was primarily a result of lower debt outstanding. Total outstanding debt decreased $79 million from May 31, 2003 to May 31, 2004, as cash from operations was used to reduce debt which had been incurred predominantly during the acquisition of Omni in May 2002 (see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below and Note 5 entitled Long-Term Debt of “Note to Consolidated Financial Statements”). 10 A write-off of a loan receivable from a garment manufacturer is included in net income as a pre-tax charge of $4.3 million. Due to developments concerning the supplier’s viability to remain as a going concern, the collectibility of the receivable was doubtful. As such, the receivable was completely written off. Pre-tax income was $432 million, a 9.2% increase over fiscal 2003. Pre-tax income from the Rentals segment increased 6.7% over the prior year due to higher rental revenue, increased efficiencies obtained from the assimilation of operations obtained from the Omni acquisition and various cost containment initiatives. Pre-tax income for the Other Services segment increased 19.6% from the prior year, due to increased sales volume, the continued leveraging of fixed costs and sourcing and cost containment initiatives. Cintas’ effective tax rate was 37% for both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 (see also Note 7 entitled Income Taxes of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”). Net income for fiscal 2004 of $272 million was a 9% increase over fiscal 2003 and diluted earnings per share of $1.58 was a 9% increase over fiscal 2003. Return on average equity was 15% in fiscal 2004 and 16% in fiscal 2003. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $197 million in fiscal 2004, or 341%, primarily due to increased revenues, a reduction in inventory levels and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in uniform and other rental items in service levels. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be used to finance future acquisitions, capital expenditures and expansion. Marketable securities consist primarily of municipal bonds and federal government securities. Accounts receivable increased $7 million due to increased revenues. Aggressive collection efforts provided for a lower sequential increase in accounts receivable as compared to total revenue growth. Inventories decreased $43 million due to improved processes and management systems, including cycle time reductions and other process improvements initiated primarily through our Six Sigma process. The completion of the Omni product line consolidation also contributed to this decrease in inventory levels. Net property and equipment increased by $8 million due to real estate purchased in conjunction with acquisitions of first aid and safety services and document management businesses. Depreciation expense exceeded capital expenditures by $4 million as Cintas continued to consolidate operations obtained from the Omni acquisition in May of 2002. In addition, due to excess plant capacity and a sluggish economy, Cintas slowed the pace of new plant construction. During the year, Cintas completed construction of four new uniform rental facilities and has an additional eight uniform rental facilities in various stages of construction to accommodate growth in rental operations. Total debt decreased $79 million through repayment of certain debt related to the purchase of Omni, net of the change in fair market value of the debt (see Note 5 entitled Long-Term Debt of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”). This significant debt reduction was possible due to strong cash flows being generated by operations. FISCAL 2003 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002 Fiscal 2003 marked the 34th year of uninterrupted growth for Cintas. Total revenue was $2.7 billion, an increase of 18% over fiscal 2002. This growth was achieved despite the difficult economic environment that existed throughout the year. The continued weakness in employment numbers directly affected our business, mainly through reduced uniform wearers, and caused our internal growth rate to be lower than our stated objective. We continued to grow organically in this environment, mainly through the continued sale of new uniform rental programs. Rentals operating segment revenues consist predominantly of revenues derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms, mats, shop towels and other items through our Uniform Rental Division. Revenue from the Rentals segment increased 20%, primarily due to the acquisition of Omni in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and growth in the customer base. Despite slow economic growth, internal growth in the Rentals segment, adjusted for one less workday during fiscal 2003, averaged over 4% for the year. New business remained healthy as we experienced continued success in selling uniform 11 rental programs to new customers. We continue to expand our rental market, with over half of our new business being comprised of customers who were first time users of uniform rental programs. Rentals revenue growth was mitigated by increased lost business and reductions in existing business, attributable to the current sluggish economy in the United States and the resulting reduction in the work force. Other Services operating segment revenues are derived from the design, manufacture and direct sale of uniforms to our customers, as well as the sale of ancillary services including restroom supplies, first aid products and services and cleanroom supplies. Other Services revenue increased 13%, primarily due to acquisitions made in late fiscal 2002 and increased customer sales. Despite slow economic growth, internal growth in the Other Services segment, adjusted for one less workday during fiscal 2003, averaged 2% for the year. Revenues from the sale of ancillary services increased 11% for the year due to increased selling efforts. This growth was partially offset by a 3% decrease in revenues from the direct sale of uniforms to our customers. This decrease was primarily a result of continued weakness in the hospitality sector and delayed purchases by large national account customers. Revenue growth in Other Services was also mitigated by increased lost business and reductions in existing business attributable to the current sluggish economy in the United States and the resulting reduction in the work force. Cost of rentals increased 23% over fiscal 2002. Cost of rentals consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and amortization of in service uniforms and other rental items. The cost increase over fiscal 2002 was primarily driven by the growth in Rentals segment revenues. A rise in fuel and energy costs as well as an increase in delivery costs associated with the Omni acquisition (primarily due to expanded route geography and smaller route size) also contributed to this increase. Cost containment initiatives were implemented throughout the year which mitigated the increased fuel, energy and delivery costs. Cost of other services increased 9% over fiscal 2002. Cost of other services consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly uniforms and first aid products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses. The increase over fiscal 2002 was due to the growth in Other Services revenue, derived primarily through acquisitions. The increased volume afforded additional overhead coverage, thereby providing a decrease in cost of other services as a percent to Other Services revenue from 70% in fiscal 2002 to 67% in fiscal 2003. Cost containment initiatives implemented throughout the year also supported this reduction in cost of other services as a percent to Other Services revenue. Selling and administrative expenses increased 20% over fiscal 2002. This increase was primarily due to increased revenues. The continued rise in medical costs and additional travel expenses also contributed to this increase. The increased travel expense was a result of the Omni acquisition and related integration, as well as a return to more normalized travel versus fiscal 2002, when travel expenses were lower due to the impact of the events of September 11. We also continue to invest heavily in our selling process in order to provide for future growth. Net interest expense increased $23 million from the prior year. This increase was primarily a result of interest on $450 million in long-term notes issued in late fiscal 2002 to finance the Omni acquisition (see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below and Note 5 entitled Long-Term Debt of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”). Pre-tax income was $396 million, a 7% increase over fiscal 2002. Pre-tax income from the Rentals segment increased 7% over the prior year, primarily due to the higher rental revenue. Pre-tax income was negatively impacted by assimilation costs associated with the Omni acquisition. Pre-tax income for the Other Services segment increased 84% from the prior year, due to increased sales volume and related leveraging of fixed costs. Cost containment initiatives were implemented throughout the year which mitigated increased delivery, medical and fuel costs. Cintas’ effective tax rate was 37% for both fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 (see also Note 7 entitled Income Taxes of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”). Net income for fiscal 2003 of $249 million was a 6% increase over fiscal 2002 and diluted earnings per share of $1.45 was a 7% increase over fiscal 2002. Return on average equity was 16% in fiscal 2003 and 18% in fiscal 2002. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by $27 million in fiscal 2003, or 32% primarily due to repayment of outstanding commercial paper. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be used to finance future acquisitions, capital expenditures and expansion. Marketable securities consist primarily of municipal bonds and federal government securities. 12 Accounts receivable decreased $5 million due to increased collection efforts given economic conditions. Inventories increased $35 million with additional levels needed to support customers obtained through acquisitions, including Omni, and the conversion of Omni customers to our product line. Additionally, Cintas is now manufacturing more products for our cleanroom and flame resistant clothing customers. Net property and equipment decreased by $1 million due to the excess of depreciation over capital expenditures. Certain capital expenditures were delayed in fiscal 2003 given reduced capacity requirements due to the sluggish economy. In fiscal 2003, Cintas completed construction of six new uniform rental facilities and had an additional six uniform rental facilities in various stages of construction to accommodate growth in rental operations. Total debt decreased $159 million through repayment of certain debt related to the purchase of Omni, net of the change in fair market value of the debt (see Note 5 entitled Long-Term Debt of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”). This significant debt reduction was possible due to strong cash flows being generated by operations. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At May 31, 2004, Cintas had $254 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, representing an increase of $197 million from May 31, 2003. This increase is primarily due to strong operational cash flows and a significant reduction in required inventory levels. Cash generated from operations was $510 million in fiscal 2004 as compared to $331 million generated in fiscal 2003. This $179 million increase was primarily due to increased net income in fiscal 2004 and the significant reduction in inventory levels. In fiscal 2003, inventory levels increased $35 million due to the acquisition of Omni and the subsequent conversion of Omni customers to the Cintas product line. Additionally, Cintas began manufacturing more products for cleanroom and flame resistant clothing customers. In fiscal 2004, inventory levels have decreased by $43 million through significant process improvements, including Six Sigma initiatives, and the consolidation of the Omni product line. Partially offsetting the increased cash flow was cash used for acquisitions of $102 million. Other significant uses of cash in fiscal 2004 were debt repayments of $69 million (adjusted for a $10 million change in derivatives), capital expenditures of $113 million and dividends of $50 million. Cintas’ investment policy pertaining to marketable securities is conservative. Preservation of principal, while earning an attractive yield, is the criteria used in making investment decisions. Working capital increased $136 million to $709 million in fiscal 2004. This increase is primarily the result of increased cash and marketable securities partially offset by the decrease in inventories discussed above. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2004 totaled $113 million, including $94 million for the Rentals segment and $19 million for Other Services. Cintas continues to reinvest in land, buildings and equipment in an effort to expand capacity for future growth. Cintas anticipates that capital expenditures for fiscal 2005 will be between $130 and $150 million. On May 13, 2002, Cintas completed the acquisition of Omni for approximately $659 million. This acquisition, coupled with smaller acquisitions in both the Rentals and Other Services segments, were financed with a combination of approximately $109 million in cash, $450 million in long-term notes, and approximately $100 million in commercial paper. As a result of this additional debt, the total debt to total capitalization ratio was 34% at May 31, 2002. Significant debt repayments occurred in fiscal 2003 ($173 million) and fiscal 2004 ($69 million). The total debt to total capitalization ratio has decreased to 20% at May 31, 2004. The $450 million in long-term notes consist of $225 million with five-year maturities at a rate of 5.125% and $225 million with ten-year maturities at a rate of 6%. Cintas has earned credit ratings on these notes of “A” from Standard & Poor’s and “A2” from Moody’s. Cintas also utilizes a $300 million commercial paper program, on which it has earned credit ratings of “A-1” from Standard & Poor’s and “Prime-1” from Moody’s. These ratings reflect Cintas’ commitment to conservative financial policies, strong financial management and a disciplined integration strategy for acquisitions. The commercial paper program is fully supported by a long-term credit facility that matures in 2009. As of May 31, 2004, there is no commercial paper outstanding. 13 During the year, Cintas paid dividends of $50 million, or $0.29 per share. On a per share basis, this dividend is an increase of 7% over the dividend paid in fiscal 2003. Following is information regarding Cintas’ long-term contractual obligations and other commitments outstanding as of May 31, 2004: LONG-TERM CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Payments Due by Period Two to One year three Four to After five (In thousands) Total or less years five years years Long-term debt (1) $ 480,741 $ 9,979 $ 9,979 $ 232,317 $ 228,466 Capital lease obligations (2) 3,467 544 1,163 1,146 614 Operating leases (3) 59,042 15,969 22,735 13,210 7,128 Unconditional purchase obligations — — — — — Total contractual cash obligations $ 543,250 $ 26,492 $ 33,877 $ 246,673 $ 236,208 (1) Reference Note 5 entitled Long-Term Debt of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a detailed discussion of long-term debt.

INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES Changes in wage, benefits and oil and fuel costs have the potential to materially impact Cintas’ financial results. Medical benefit costs in particular continue to rise, increasing approximately 18% annually over the last three fiscal years. Medical benefits accounted for approximately 3% of total revenues in fiscal 2004. Management believes inflation has not had a material impact on Cintas’ financial condition or a negative impact on operations. 14 LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary course of business actions, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of Cintas. Cintas is party to additional litigation not considered in the ordinary course of business, including the litigation discussed below. Cintas is a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit, Paul Veliz, et al., v. Cintas Corporation, filed on March 19, 2003, in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, Oakland Division, alleging that Cintas violated certain federal and state wage and hour laws applicable to its service sales representatives, whom Cintas considers exempt employees, and asserting additional related ERISA claims. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified monetary damages, injunctive relief, or both. Cintas denies these claims and is defending the plaintiffs’ allegations. The court ordered arbitration for all potential plaintiffs except for those that fall into one of four narrowly defined exceptions. As a result, Cintas believes that a majority of the potential plaintiffs will be required to arbitrate their claims. No determination has been made by the court or an arbitrator regarding class certification. There can be no assurance as to whether a class will be certified or, if a class is certified, as to the geographic or other scope of such class. If a court or arbitrator certifies a class in this action and there is an adverse verdict on the merits, or in the event of a negotiated settlement of the action, the resulting liability and/or any increased costs of operations on an ongoing basis could be material to Cintas. Any estimated liability relating to this lawsuit is not determinable at this time. Cintas is also a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit, Robert Ramirez, et al., v. Cintas Corporation, filed on January 20, 2004, and pending in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, San Francisco Division. The case was brought on behalf of all past and present female, African-American and Hispanic employees of Cintas and its subsidiaries. The complaint alleges that Cintas has engaged in a pattern and practice of discriminating against women and minorities in recruitment, hiring, promotions, transfers, job assignments and pay. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, compensatory damages, punitive damages and attorney’s fees, among other things. Cintas denies these claims and is defending the plaintiffs’ allegations. No filings or determination has been made as to class certification. There can be no assurance as to whether a class will be certified or, if a class is certified, as to the geographic or other scope of such class. If a court certifies a class in this action and there is an adverse verdict on the merits, or in the event of a negotiated settlement of the action, the resulting liability and/or any increased costs of operations on an ongoing basis could be material to Cintas. Any estimated liability relating to this lawsuit is not determinable at this time. The litigation discussed above, if decided adversely to or settled by Cintas, may result in liability material to Cintas’ financial condition or results of operations. Cintas may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these and other lawsuits, and may enter into settlement agreements if it believes such settlement is in the best interests of Cintas’ shareholders. Cintas is subject to various environmental laws and regulations, as are other companies in the industry. While costs related to environmental compliance are not a material component of the cost of rentals, Cintas must incur capital expenditures and associated operating costs for water treatment and waste removal on a regular basis. Environmental spending amounted to approximately $12 million in fiscal 2004 and $12 million in fiscal 2003. This spending includes labor and chemical costs for water treatment, as well as costs for waste removal. Capital expenditures to limit or monitor hazardous substances were $3 million in fiscal 2004 and $3 million in fiscal 2003. These expenditures were primarily related to the purchase of water treatment systems. 15 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. The Interpretation requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity. Currently, entities are generally consolidated by an enterprise when it has a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity. Cintas adopted this Interpretation on July 1, 2003, with no material effect to its financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 (SFAS 148), Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure. This Statement amends FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements regarding the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Cintas continues to apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 for the method used to account for stock-based employee compensation arrangements, where applicable, but has adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS 148. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of Cintas’ consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with Note 1 entitled Significant Accounting Policies in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”. Significant changes, estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the financial statements. Revenue recognition Rental revenue is recognized when services are performed and other services revenue is recognized when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer. Cintas also establishes an allowance for uncollectible accounts. This allowance is an estimate based on historical rates of collectibility. An uncollectible accounts provision is recorded for overdue amounts, beginning with a nominal percentage and increasing substantially as the account ages. The amount provided as the account ages will differ slightly between the Rentals and Other Services segments, because of differences in customers served and the nature of each business segment. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. Substantially all inventories represent finished goods. Cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual to standard costs to the inventory balances. The judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or market. Inventory obsolescence is determined by specific identification, as well as an estimate based on historical rates of obsolescence. Uniforms and other rental items in service Uniform and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization, calculated using the straight-line method. Uniforms in service (other than cleanroom and flame resistant garments) are amortized over their useful life of eighteen months. Other rental items including shop towels, mats, cleanroom garments, flame resistant garments, linens and restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives of eight to forty-eight months. The amortization rates used are based on industry experience, Cintas’ experience and wear tests performed by Cintas. These factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory that is presented in the financial statements. 16 Property and equipment Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is typically thirty to forty years for buildings, five to twenty years for building improvements, three to ten years for equipment and two to five years for leasehold improvements. When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted) are compared to the carrying amount of the assets. If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss is recorded. The impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the assets with their carrying amounts. Fair value is determined by discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate. Long-lived assets that are held for disposal are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value, less estimated costs related to disposition. Goodwill and impairment Goodwill, primarily obtained through acquisitions of businesses, is valued at cost less any impairment. Cintas performs an annual impairment test. Based on the results of the impairment tests, Cintas has not recognized an impairment of goodwill for the years ended May 31, 2004, 2003 or 2002. Service contracts and other assets Service contracts and other assets, which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses, are amortized by use of the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the agreements, which are generally five to ten years. Certain noncompete agreements, as well as all service contracts, require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model. The assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates, among other factors. Because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets, actual results over time could vary from original estimates. Environmental and litigation Cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims related to environmental matters arising from the ordinary course of business. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. Cintas regularly consults with attorneys to ensure that all of the relevant facts and circumstances are considered before a contingent liability is recorded. While a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities, Cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the financial statements. A detailed discussion of litigation matters is included in Note 12 entitled Litigation and Environmental Matters of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”. Income taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Please reference Note 7 entitled Income Taxes of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income taxes that are not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting are classified according to the expected reversal date. Cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. As a result of this review, Cintas has not established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. Cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions, Cintas records reserves for probable exposures. Based on Cintas’ evaluation of current tax positions, Cintas believes it has appropriately accrued for probable exposures. 17 OUTLOOK As we look forward to fiscal 2005, our outlook is positive, but guarded. The economy has been gaining traction as employment figures strengthen. Our internal growth rates have been improving as well. We see significant upside potential for all of our business units, especially given our relatively low 9% market share of a $31 billion estimated potential market. Although difficult to predict, we anticipate continued growth in all of our business units. Overall performance will be largely driven by the continued recovery in the economy. In the marketplace, competition and related pricing pressure will continue; however, we believe cost containment initiatives, technological advances and continued leverage of our infrastructure will soften or offset any impact. When appropriate opportunities arise, we will supplement our internal growth with strategic acquisitions. Like most other companies, we experienced, and anticipate continuing to experience, increased costs for wages and benefits, including medical benefits. Changes in oil and fuel costs also have the potential to impact our results. Cintas is currently the target of a corporate unionization campaign by UNITE HERE and the Teamsters unions. These unions are attempting to pressure Cintas into surrendering our employees’ rights to a government-supervised election and unilaterally accept union representation. This is unacceptable. Cintas’ philosophy in regard to unions is straightforward: We believe that employees have the right to say yes to union representation and the freedom to say no. This campaign could be materially disruptive to our business and could materially adversely affect results of operations. We will continue to vigorously oppose this campaign and to defend our employees’ rights. We believe that the high level of customer service provided by our partners and supported by our infrastructure, quality products, financial resources and corporate culture will provide for continued business success. However, a number of factors influence future revenue, margins and profit which make forecasting difficult. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Cintas manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable and fixed rate debt, marketable securities and interest rate swap agreements. Earnings are affected by changes in short-term interest rates due to the use of variable rate notes and revolving credit facilities amounting to approximately $230 million, with an average interest rate of 2.63%. This exposure is limited by the purchase of marketable securities and interest rate swap agreements as a hedge against variability in short-term rates. If short-term rates change by one-half percent (or 50 basis points), Cintas’ income before taxes would change by approximately $1.1 million. This estimated exposure considers the mitigating effects of marketable securities and swap agreements on the change in the cost of variable rate debt. This analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in Cintas’ capital structure. 18",2023-12-30 21:41:31.165337
