49071,HUM,HUMANA INC,2016,"Item 7. – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the section titled “Health Care Reform” in this 2015 Form 10-K.Business SegmentsOn January 1, 2015, we realigned certain of our businesses among our reportable segments to correspond with internal management reporting changes and renamed our Employer Group segment to the Group segment. Our three reportable segments remain Retail, Group, and Healthcare Services. The more significant realignments included reclassifying Medicare benefits offered to groups to the Retail segment from the Group segment, bringing all of our Medicare offerings, which are now managed collectively, together in one segment, recognizing that in some instances we market directly to individuals that are part of a group Medicare account. In addition, we realigned our military services business, primarily consisting of our TRICARE South Region contract previously included in the Other Businesses category, to our Group segment as we consider this contract with the government to be a group account. Prior period segment financial information has been recast to conform to the 2015 presentation. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in",2023-12-30 21:10:18.703548
49071,HUM,HUMANA INC,2017,"Item 7. – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the section titled “Health Care Reform” in this 2016 Form 10-K.If we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives with respect to the implementation of the Health Care Reform Law, our business may be materially adversely affected. Additionally, potential legislative changes, including activities to repeal or replace the Health Care Reform Law, creates uncertainty for our business, and we cannot predict when, or in what form, such legislative changes may occur.Business SegmentsWe manage our business with three reportable segments: Retail, Group, and Healthcare Services. In addition, the Other Businesses category includes businesses that are not individually reportable because they do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles. These segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on well-being solutions for our health plans and other customers, as described below. These segment groupings are consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer to assess performance and allocate resources.Our ProductsOur medical and specialty insurance products allow members to access health care services primarily through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted. These products may vary in the degree to which members have coverage. Health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, generally require a referral from the member’s primary care provider before seeing certain specialty physicians. Preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, provide members the freedom to choose a health care provider without requiring a referral. However PPOs generally require the member to pay a greater portion of the provider’s fee in the event the member chooses not to use a provider participating in the PPO’s network. Point of Service, or POS, plans combine the advantages of HMO plans with the 4flexibility of PPO plans. In general, POS plans allow members to choose, at the time medical services are needed, to seek care from a provider within the plan’s network or outside the network. In addition, we offer services to our health plan members as well as to third parties that promote health and wellness, including pharmacy solutions, provider, home based, and clinical programs, as well as services and capabilities to advance population health. At the core of our strategy is our integrated care delivery model, which unites quality care, high member engagement, and sophisticated data analytics. Three core elements of the model are to improve the consumer experience by simplifying the interaction with us, engaging members in clinical programs, and offering assistance to providers in transitioning from a fee-for-service to a value-based arrangement. Our approach to primary, physician-directed care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent, integrated, cost-effective, and member-focused. The model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole, while offering our members a simple, seamless healthcare experience. The discussion that follows describes the products offered by each of our segments.Our Retail Segment ProductsThis segment is comprised of products sold on a retail basis to individuals including medical and supplemental benefit plans described in the discussion that follows. The following table presents our premiums and services revenue for the Retail segment by product for the year ended December 31, 2016: Retail SegmentPremiums andServices Revenue Percent ofConsolidatedPremiums andServices Revenue (dollars in millions)Premiums: Individual Medicare Advantage $31,863 59.0%Group Medicare Advantage 4,283 8.0%Medicare stand-alone PDP 4,009 7.4%Total Medicare 40,155 74.4%Individual commercial 3,492 6.4%State-based Medicaid 2,640 4.9%Individual specialty 259 0.5%Total premiums 46,546 86.2%Services 8 —%Total premiums and services revenue $46,554 86.2%MedicareWe have participated in the Medicare program for private health plans for over 30 years and have established a national presence, offering at least one type of Medicare plan in all 50 states. We have a geographically diverse membership base that we believe provides us with greater ability to expand our network of PPO and HMO providers. We employ strategies including health assessments and clinical guidance programs such as lifestyle and fitness programs for seniors to guide Medicare beneficiaries in making cost-effective decisions with respect to their health care. We believe these strategies result in cost savings that occur from making positive behavior changes.Medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons under the age of 65 certain hospital and medical insurance benefits. CMS, an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, administers the Medicare program. Hospitalization benefits are provided under Part A, without the payment of any premium, for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days. Eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible for physician care and other services under Part B. Beneficiaries eligible for Part A and Part B coverage under traditional fee-for-service Medicare are still required to pay out-of-pocket deductibles and coinsurance. Throughout this document this program is referred to as Medicare FFS. As an alternative to Medicare FFS, in geographic areas where a managed care organization has contracted with CMS pursuant to the Medicare Advantage program, Medicare beneficiaries may choose to receive benefits from a Medicare Advantage organization under Medicare Part C. Pursuant to Medicare Part C, Medicare Advantage organizations contract with CMS to offer Medicare Advantage plans to provide benefits at least comparable to those offered under Medicare FFS. Our Medicare Advantage, or MA, plans are discussed more fully below. Prescription drug benefits are provided under Part D.Individual Medicare Advantage ProductsWe contract with CMS under the Medicare Advantage program to provide a comprehensive array of health insurance benefits, including wellness programs, chronic care management, and care coordination, to Medicare eligible persons under HMO, PPO, and Private Fee-For-Service, or PFFS, plans in exchange for contractual payments received from CMS, usually a fixed payment per member per month. With each of these products, the beneficiary receives benefits in excess of Medicare FFS, typically including reduced cost sharing, enhanced prescription drug benefits, care coordination, data analysis techniques to help identify member needs, complex case management, tools to guide members in their health care decisions, care management programs, wellness and prevention programs and, in some instances, a reduced monthly Part B premium. Most Medicare Advantage plans offer the prescription drug benefit under Part D as part of the basic plan, subject to cost sharing and other limitations. Accordingly, all of the provisions of the Medicare Part D program described in connection with our stand-alone prescription drug plans in the following section also are applicable to most of our Medicare Advantage plans. Medicare Advantage plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for Medicare-covered services or for certain extra benefits. Generally, Medicare-eligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between October 15 and December 7 for coverage that begins on the following January 1.Our Medicare HMO and PPO plans, which cover Medicare-eligible individuals residing in certain counties, may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating in-network providers or in emergency situations. Except in emergency situations or as specified by the plan, most HMO plans provide no out-of-network benefits. PPO plans carry an out-of network benefit that is subject to higher member cost-sharing. In some cases, these beneficiaries are required to pay a monthly premium to the HMO or PPO plan in addition to the monthly Part B premium they are required to pay the Medicare program.Most of our Medicare PFFS plans are network-based products with in and out of network benefits due to a requirement that Medicare Advantage organizations establish adequate provider networks, except in geographic areas that CMS determines have fewer than two network-based Medicare Advantage plans. In these areas, we offer Medicare PFFS plans that have no preferred network. Individuals in these plans pay us a monthly premium to receive typical Medicare Advantage benefits along with the freedom to choose any health care provider that accepts individuals at rates equivalent to Medicare FFS payment rates.CMS uses monthly rates per person for each county to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to health benefit plans. These rates are adjusted under CMS’s risk-adjustment model which uses health status indicators, or risk scores, to improve the accuracy of payment. The risk-adjustment model, which CMS implemented pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and the Benefits and Improvement Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA), generally pays more for members with predictably higher costs and uses principal hospital inpatient diagnoses as well as diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings (hospital outpatient department and physician visits) to establish the risk-adjustment payments. Under the risk-adjustment methodology, all health benefit organizations must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to CMS within prescribed deadlines. CMS is phasing-in the process of calculating risk scores using diagnoses data from the Risk Adjustment Processing System, or RAPS, to diagnosis data from the Encounter Data System, or EDS. The RAPS process requires MA plans to apply a filter logic based on CMS guidelines and only submit those claims that pass the filtering logic. For submissions through EDS, CMS requires MA plans to submit all the claims data and CMS will apply the risk adjustment filtering logic to determine the risk adjustment data used to calculate risk scores. For 2016, 10% of the risk score was calculated from claims data submitted through EDS, increasing to 25% of the risk score calculated from claims data through EDS for 2017. At December 31, 2016, we provided health insurance coverage under CMS contracts to approximately 2,837,600 individual Medicare Advantage members, including approximately 598,100 members in Florida. These Florida contracts accounted for premiums revenue of approximately $7.7 billion, which represented approximately 24.2% of our individual Medicare Advantage premiums revenue, or 14.0% of our consolidated premiums and services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016.6Our HMO, PPO, and PFFS products covered under Medicare Advantage contracts with CMS are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless CMS notifies us of its decision not to renew by May 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end, or we notify CMS of our decision not to renew by the first Monday in June of the calendar year in which the contract would end. All material contracts between Humana and CMS relating to our Medicare Advantage products have been renewed for 2017, and all of our product offerings filed with CMS for 2017 have been approved.Individual Medicare Stand-Alone Prescription Drug ProductsWe offer stand-alone prescription drug plans, or PDPs, under Medicare Part D, including a PDP offering co-branded with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., or the Humana-Walmart plan. Generally, Medicare-eligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between October 15 and December 7 for coverage that begins on the following January 1. Our stand-alone PDP offerings consist of plans offering basic coverage with benefits mandated by Congress, as well as plans providing enhanced coverage with varying degrees of out-of-pocket costs for premiums, deductibles, and co-insurance. Our revenues from CMS and the beneficiary are determined from our PDP bids submitted annually to CMS. These revenues also reflect the health status of the beneficiary and risk sharing provisions as more fully described in Item 7. – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the section titled “Medicare Part D Provisions.” Our stand-alone PDP contracts with CMS are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless CMS notifies us of its decision not to renew by May 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end, or we notify CMS of our decision not to renew by the first Monday in June of the calendar year in which the contract would end. All material contracts between Humana and CMS relating to our Medicare stand-alone PDP products have been renewed for 2017, and all of our product offerings filed with CMS for 2017 have been approved.We have administered CMS’s Limited Income Newly Eligible Transition, or LI-NET, prescription drug plan program since 2010. This program allows individuals who receive Medicare’s low-income subsidy to also receive immediate prescription drug coverage at the point of sale if they are not already enrolled in a Medicare Part D plan. CMS temporarily enrolls newly identified individuals with both Medicare and Medicaid into the LI-NET prescription drug plan program, and subsequently transitions each member into a Medicare Part D plan that may or may not be a Humana Medicare plan.Group Medicare Advantage and Medicare stand-alone PDPWe offer products that enable employers that provide post-retirement health care benefits to replace Medicare wrap or Medicare supplement products with Medicare Advantage or stand-alone PDPs from Humana. These products offer the same types of benefits and services available to members in our individual Medicare plans discussed previously and can be tailored to closely match an employer’s post-retirement benefit structure.State-based Medicaid ContractsOur state-based contracts allow us to serve members enrolled in state-based Medicaid programs including Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, or TANF, Long-Term Support Services, or LTSS, and dual eligible demonstration programs. TANF is a state and federally funded program that provides cash assistance and supportive services to assist families with children under age 18, helping them achieve economic self-sufficiency. LTSS is a state and federally funded program that offers states a broad and flexible set of program design options and refers to the delivery of long-term support services for our members who receive home and community or institution-based services for long-term care. Our contracts are generally for three to five year terms.Medicare beneficiaries who also qualify for Medicaid due to low income or special needs are known as dual eligible beneficiaries, or dual eligibles. The dual eligible population represents a disproportionate share of Medicaid and Medicare costs. There were approximately 10.4 million dual eligible individuals in the United States in 2016, trending upward due to Medicaid eligibility expansions and individuals aging into the Medicare program. Since the enactment of the Health Care Reform Law, states are pursuing stand-alone dual eligible CMS demonstration programs in which Medicare, Medicaid, and LTSS benefits are more tightly integrated. Eligibility for participation in these stand-alone dual eligible demonstration programs may require state-based contractual relationships in existing Medicaid programs. 7We have contracts to serve Medicaid eligible members in Florida under the TANF and LTSS programs. Our contracts in Virginia and Illinois serve members under each state’s stand-alone dual eligible demonstration program. In addition, in Illinois we have an Integrated Care Program, or ICP, Medicaid contract. Our Kentucky Medicaid contract is subject to a 100% coinsurance contract with CareSource Management Group Company, ceding all the risk to CareSource. In addition to the dual eligible members we serve under the Virginia and Illinois demonstration program, we serve other dual eligible members enrolled in our Medicare Advantage and stand-alone prescription drug plans. As of December 31, 2016, we served approximately 486,000 dual eligible members in our Medicare Advantage plans and approximately 1,179,000 dual eligible members in our stand-alone prescription drug plans.Individual Commercial CoverageOur individual health plans are marketed under the HumanaOne brand. We offer products both on and off of the public exchange. We offer products on exchanges where we can achieve an affordable cost of care, including HMO offerings and select networks in most markets. Our off-exchange products are primarily PPO and POS offerings, including plans issued prior to 2014 that were previously underwritten. For 2017, we discontinued substantially all Health Care Reform Law compliant off-exchange individual commercial medical plans effective January 1, 2017. Policies issued prior to the enactment of the Health Care Reform Law on March 23, 2010 are grandfathered policies. Grandfathered policies are exempt from most of the requirements of the Health Care Reform Law, including mandated benefits. However, our grandfathered plans include provisions that guarantee renewal of coverage for as long as the plan is continued and the individual chooses to renew. Policies issued between March 23, 2010 and December 31, 2013 are required to conform to the Health Care Reform Law, including mandated benefits, upon renewal at various transition dates between 2016 and 2017 depending on the state.On February 14, 2017, we announced we are exiting our individual commercial medical businesses January 1, 2018 as more fully described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in",2023-12-30 21:10:20.132789

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The consolidated financial statements of Humana Inc. in this document present the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis. References to “we,” “us,” “our,” “Company,” and “Humana” mean Humana Inc. and its subsidiaries. This discussion includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this filing and in future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases, investor presentations, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words or phrases like “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “likely will result,” “estimates,” “projects” or variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward–looking statements. These forward–looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, among other things, information set forth in the “Cautionary Statements” section of this document. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward–looking events discussed in this document might not occur. There may also be other risks that we are unable to predict at this time. Any of these risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward–looking statements. Introduction Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, Humana Inc. is one of the nation’s largest publicly traded health benefits companies, based on our 2002 revenues of $11.3 billion. We offer coordinated health insurance coverage and related services through a variety of traditional and Internet-based plans for employer groups, government-sponsored programs, and individuals. As of December 31, 2002, we had approximately 6.6 million members in our medical insurance programs, as well as approximately 1.6 million members in our specialty products programs. We have approximately 425,000 contracts with physicians, hospitals, dentists and other providers to provide health care to our members. In 2002, approximately 70% of our premiums and administrative services fees resulted from members located in Florida, Illinois, Texas, Kentucky, and Ohio. We derived approximately 44% of our premiums and administrative services fees from contracts with the federal government in 2002. Under two federal government contracts with the Department of Defense, we provide health insurance coverage to TRICARE members, accounting for approximately 19% of our total premiums and administrative services fees in 2002. Under one federal government contract with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, we provide health insurance coverage to approximately 228,400 Medicare+Choice members in Florida, accounting for approximately 16% of our total premiums and administrative services fees in 2002. We manage our business with two segments: Commercial and Government. The Commercial segment consists of members enrolled in products marketed to employer groups and individuals, and includes three lines of business: fully insured medical, administrative services only, or ASO, and specialty. The Government segment consists of members enrolled in government-sponsored programs, and includes three lines of business: Medicare+Choice, Medicaid, and TRICARE. We identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information which is consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer in managing our business. The segment information aggregates products with similar economic characteristics. These characteristics include the nature of customer groups and pricing, benefits and underwriting requirements. The results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes. We allocate all selling, general and administrative expenses, investment and other income, interest expense, and goodwill, but no other assets or liabilities, to our segments. Members served by our two segments generally utilize the same medical provider networks, enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share overhead costs and assets. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. Our business strategy centers on increasing Commercial segment profitability while maintaining our existing strength in the Government segment. Our strategy to increase Commercial segment profitability focuses 23 Table of Contents on providing solutions for employers to the rising cost of health care through the use of innovative and consumer-centric product designs which are supported by service excellence and industry-leading electronic capabilities, including education, tools and technologies provided primarily through the Internet. The intent of our Commercial segment strategy is to enable us to further penetrate high potential commercial markets and to transform the traditional consumer experience for both employers and members to result in a high degree of consumer satisfaction, loyalty and brand awareness. We are in the process of reducing our administrative cost structure primarily to support our Commercial strategy. Restructuring Charge During the fourth quarter of 2002, we finalized a plan to reduce our administrative cost structure with the consolidation of seven customer service centers into four and an enterprise-wide workforce reduction. The following table presents the components of the restructuring charge we recorded for the year ended December 31, 2002: 2002 Charge Cash Payments Non-cash Balance at December 31, 2002 Expected Future Cash Outlays (in thousands) Severance and related employee benefits $ 32,105 $ 910 $ — $ 31,195 $ 31,195 Long-lived asset impairment 2,448 — 2,448 — — Leased equipment discontinuance costs 1,324 — — 1,324 1,324 Total restructuring charges $ 35,877 $ 910 $ 2,448 $ 32,519 $ 32,519 Severance During the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded severance and related employee benefit costs of $32.1 million ($19.6 million after tax) in connection with customer service center consolidation and an enterprise-wide workforce reduction. Severance costs were estimated based upon the provisions of the Company’s existing employee benefit plans and policies. The plan to reduce our administrative cost structure is expected to affect approximately 2,600 positions throughout the entire organization including customer service, claim administrations, clinical operations, provider network administration, as well as other corporate and field-based positions. As part of the plan, we expect to hire approximately 300 employees to support newly consolidated operations, thereby resulting in a net reduction of approximately 2,300 employees. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 500 positions had been eliminated. We expect the remaining positions to be eliminated by December 31, 2003, with most of the severance being paid in 2003. As a result of these actions, we expect a reduction in historical compensation expense will improve our pretax results by approximately $70 million ($43 million after tax) in 2003 and $110 million ($67 million after tax) annually thereafter and after tax cash flows from operating activities by approximately $13 million in 2003 including estimated severance payments of approximately $30 million and $65 million annually thereafter. Long-lived Asset Impairment Our decision to eliminate three customer service centers prompted a review during the fourth quarter of 2002 for the possible impairment of long-lived assets used in these operations. We will continue to use some long-lived assets associated with these customer service center operations until mid-2003, the expected completion date for consolidating these operations. We are currently evaluating alternatives with respect to future use of these long-lived assets, including possible sale. Our impairment review indicated that future estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to our business supported by our San Antonio, Texas customer service operations were insufficient to recover the carrying value 24 Table of Contents of certain long-lived assets, primarily buildings used in these operations. Accordingly, we adjusted the carrying value of these long-lived assets to their estimated fair value resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $2.4 million ($1.5 million after tax). Estimated fair value was based on an independent third party appraisal of the buildings. By the end of the first quarter of 2003, we expect the estimated future undiscounted cash flow attributable to our business supported by our Jacksonville, Florida customer service operations will be insufficient to recover the carrying value of additional long-lived assets, primarily a building used in our Florida operations. Accordingly, we expect to record a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $17.2 million ($10.5 million after tax) during the first quarter of 2003. Additionally, we expect to record a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $13.5 million during the first quarter of 2003 ($8.3 million after tax) related to accelerated depreciation of software we will cease using with these operations. As a result of these actions, we expect a reduction in historical depreciation and rent expense will improve our pretax results by approximately $5 million ($3 million after tax) in 2003 and $6 million ($4 million after tax) annually thereafter. The impact on operating cash flows is not expected to be material. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to medical cost and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities, goodwill, and long-lived assets. These estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events, and accordingly, actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Medical Cost Recognition Medical costs include claim payments, capitation payments, allocations of certain centralized expenses and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to members, as well as estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided prior to the balance sheet date. Capitation payments represent monthly contractual fees disbursed to primary care physicians and other providers who are responsible for providing medical care to members. We estimate the costs of our future medical claims and other medical expense payments using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns, medical cost inflation, historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns, and other relevant factors, and record medical claims reserves for future payments. We continually review estimates of future payments relating to medical claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves. Medical cost inflation, among other items, may significantly impact our estimate of medical costs. Medical cost inflationary trends today are substantially higher than other segments of the economy. In the early 1990’s employer-driven migration to HMO enrollment was popular and resulted in several years of very low medical cost trends. Today, there are very few economic forces existing to mitigate increases in the utilization of hospital and physician services, prescription drugs and new medical technologies, and the inflationary trend on the cost per unit for each of these expense components. Additionally, as we are realigning our operating model around our commercial strategy, we continue to reduce the level of traditional utilization management functions such as pre-authorization of services, monitoring of inpatient admissions and requirements for physician referrals. Other external factors such as government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, catastrophes and epidemics may also impact cost trends. 25 Table of Contents Any of the items above, or other unforeseen circumstances, may result in actual medical cost trends differing materially from our estimates and a relatively small variance between our estimates of medical cost trends and actual trends could have a material impact, either favorable or unfavorable, on the adequacy of our medical claims reserves and our overall financial position. For example, a 100 basis point, or 1 percent, change in the estimate of our medical and other expenses payable at December 31, 2002, which represents 39% of total liabilities, would require an adjustment of $11.4 million in a future period in which the revision in the estimate becomes known. A 100 basis point change in estimated medical expense trends would have changed annual pretax results of our Commercial segment by $48.7 million and our Government segment by $42.7 million in 2002. Note 5 in our consolidated financial statements presents a reconciliation of beginning and ending balances for medical and other expenses payable. The table includes the changes in estimates of medical claims payable subsequently recorded to each year. A summary of these changes in estimates and percentage of beginning medical claim reserves follows: Year ended December 31, Amount Percentage of Beginning Reserves Percentage of Medical Expenses Variance (in millions) 2002 $ 12.3 1.1 % 0.1 % Unfavorable development 2001 $ 23.4 1.8 % 0.3 % Favorable development 2000 $ 8.5 0.6 % 0.1 % Favorable development Revenue Recognition We generally establish one-year commercial membership contracts with employer groups, subject to cancellation by the employer group’s written notice. Our TRICARE contracts with the federal government and our contracts with various state Medicaid programs are generally multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions. Our Medicare+Choice contracts with the federal government renew annually. We bill and collect premium and administrative fee remittances from employer groups and some individual Medicare+Choice members monthly. We receive monthly premiums and administrative fees from the federal government and various states according to government specified reimbursement rates and various contractual terms. Premium revenues are recognized as income in the period members are entitled to receive services, and are net of estimated uncollectible amounts and retroactive membership adjustments. Retroactive membership adjustments result from enrollment changes not yet processed, or not yet reported by an employer group or the government. We routinely monitor the collectibility of specific accounts, the aging of receivables, historical retroactivity trends, as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, and any required adjustments are reflected in current operations. Administrative services only fees, or ASO, are earned as services are performed. Administrative services fees cover the processing of claims, offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs, and responding to customer service inquiries from members of self-funded employers. Under ASO contracts, self-funded employers and, for TRICARE ASO, the Department of Defense, retain the risk of financing the cost of health benefits. Premium and ASO receivables are shown net of allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts and retroactive membership adjustments. Premiums and ASO fees received prior to the period members are entitled to receive services are recorded as unearned revenues. 26 Table of Contents TRICARE Revenues Base premium revenues as originally specified in our TRICARE contracts are recognized ratably throughout each contract year as eligible beneficiaries are entitled to receive services. TRICARE revenues also include estimates for amounts recoverable from the federal government as a result of bid price adjustments, or BPAs, and change orders. Under our TRICARE contracts, we retain the financial risk of contractual discounts in the provider networks, same-store utilization of services and administrative overhead. However, the federal government retains the financial risk associated with changes in usage levels at military treatment facilities, or MTF, changes in the number of persons eligible for TRICARE benefits and medical unit cost inflation. BPAs are utilized to retroactively adjust premium revenues for the impact of the items for which the federal government retains risk. We work closely with the federal government to obtain and review eligibility and MTF workload data, and to quantify and negotiate amounts recoverable or payable under our contractual BPA requirements. We record revenues applicable to BPAs when these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. Because final settlement of BPAs occurs only at specified intervals, typically in excess of 6 months after the end of a contract year for our largest regions, cumulative amounts receivable or payable under BPAs may be outstanding in excess of a year. Amounts receivable or payable within a year are classified as premiums receivable or trade accounts payable and accrued expenses, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets. Amounts receivable or payable for longer than one year are classified as other long-term assets or other long-term liabilities, respectively. As a result of the events of September 11, 2001, the subsequent build-up of military personnel to support military operations in Afghanistan and the continuing build-up of military personnel surrounding other international tensions, the magnitude of BPA activity is currently much more significant than in prior years. TRICARE change orders occur when we perform services or incur costs under the directive of the federal government that were not originally specified in our contracts. Under federal regulations we are entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price, which results in additional premium revenues. Examples of items that have necessitated substantial change orders in recent years include congressionally legislated increases in the level of benefits for TRICARE beneficiaries and the administration of new government programs such as TRICARE for Life and TRICARE Senior Pharmacy. Like BPAs, we record revenue applicable to change orders when these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. Unlike BPAs, where settlement only occurs at specified intervals, change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year. Total TRICARE premium and ASO fee receivables at December 31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows: December 31, 2002 2001 (in thousands) TRICARE premiums receivable: Base receivable $ 190,339 $ 164,621 Bid price adjustments (BPAs) 104,044 — Change orders 1,400 1,431 Subtotal 295,783 166,052 Less: long-term portion of BPAs (86,471 ) — Total TRICARE premiums receivable $ 209,312 $ 166,052 TRICARE ASO fees receivable: Base receivable $ 7,205 $ 2,142 Change orders 56,230 16,992 Total $ 63,435 $ 19,134 27 Table of Contents Our TRICARE contracts also contain risk-sharing provisions with the federal government to minimize any losses and limit any profits in the event that medical costs for which we are at risk differ from the levels targeted in our contracts. Amounts receivable from the federal government under such risk-sharing provisions are included in the BPA receivable above, while amounts payable to the federal government under these provisions of approximately $23 million are included in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets. Investment Securities Investment securities totaled $1,694.6 million, or 37% of total assets at December 31, 2002. Debt securities totaled $1,637.5 million, or 97% of our total investment portfolio. The average duration of our debt securities was approximately 3 years and more than 95% of our debt securities were of investment-grade quality with an average of AA by Standard & Poor’s at December 31, 2002. Most of the debt securities that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end of the non-investment grade spectrum. Our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types. Our investment securities are categorized as available for sale and, as a result, are stated at fair value. Fair value of publicly traded debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices. Non traded debt securities are priced independently by a third party vendor. Fair value of strategic venture capital debt and equity securities that are privately held, or where an observable quoted market price does not exist, are estimated using a variety of valuation methodologies. Such methodologies include reviewing the value ascribed to the most recent financing, comparing the security with securities of publicly traded companies in a similar line of business, and reviewing the underlying financial performance including estimating discounted cash flows. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of applicable deferred taxes, are included as a component of stockholders’ equity until realized from a sale or impairment. Gross unrealized losses totaled $12.6 million, or 0.7% of our total investment portfolio at December 31, 2002 compared to $19.5 million, or 1.2% at December 31, 2001. We had no material unrealized loss on any one individual investment security or within any one industry at December 31, 2002. We regularly evaluate our investment securities for impairment. We consider factors affecting the investee, factors affecting the industry the investee operates within, and general debt and equity market trends. We consider the length of time an investment’s fair value has been below carrying value, the near term prospects for recovery to carrying value and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or market recovery is realized. If and when a determination is made that a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary, the related investment is written down to its estimated fair value through earnings. The risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations; facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time; or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment. The determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment. The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments. The current economic environment and recent volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment. The same influences tend to increase the risk of potentially impaired assets. Gross realized losses in 2002 included impairment losses of $19.6 million related to privately held investment securities after an evaluation indicated that a decline in fair value below the cost basis was other than temporary. Goodwill and Long-lived Asset At December 31, 2002, goodwill and other long-lived assets represented 28% of total assets and 79% of total stockholders’ equity. 28 Table of Contents Goodwill is no longer amortized but must be tested at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. A reporting unit is one level below our Commercial and Government segments. The Commercial segment’s two reporting units consist of fully and self-insured medical and specialty. The Government segment’s three reporting units consist of Medicare+Choice, TRICARE and Medicaid. Goodwill was assigned to the reporting unit that was expected to benefit from a specific acquisition. If goodwill was expected to benefit multiple reporting units, we allocated goodwill in connection with our transitional impairment test as of January 1, 2002 based upon the reporting units’ relative fair value. This process resulted in the allocation of $633.2 million of goodwill to the Commercial segment and $143.7 million of goodwill to the Government segment. Our long-range business plan and annual planning process supports our goodwill impairment tests. These tests are based primarily on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows under several scenarios. We used a range of discount rates that correspond to our weighted-average cost of capital. Key assumptions including changes in membership, premium yields, medical cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our long-range business plan and annual planning process. If these assumptions differ from actual, the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected. Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment and other intangible assets. These assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life, and are subject to impairment reviews. We periodically review long-lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. In assessing recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist, and, if so, estimate fair value. We also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long-lived assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life, including accelerating depreciation for these assets. In 2002, we recognized long-lived asset impairment losses of $2.4 million as a result of our decision to eliminate three customer service centers. We expect to recognize additional long-lived asset impairment losses of approximately $30.7 million in 2003 related to these service center consolidation initiatives. See “Restructuring Charge” section and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. Recent Transactions Acquisitions On May 31, 2001, we acquired the outstanding shares of common stock of a newly-formed Anthem Health Insurance Company subsidiary responsible for administering TRICARE benefits in Regions 2 and 5 for $43.5 million in cash, net of direct transaction costs. During 2000, in separate transactions, we acquired a Houston-based health plan, two operating shell entities for future business initiatives, and a hospital in-patient management services firm for $76.3 million in cash, net of direct transaction costs. We accounted for each of these acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly, our consolidated results of operations include the results of the acquired businesses from the date of acquisition. For each acquisition, we allocated the purchase price to net tangible and other intangible assets based upon their fair values. Any remaining value not assigned to net tangible or other intangible assets was then allocated to goodwill. Other intangible assets primarily relate to government, subscriber and provider contracts and the cost of the acquired licenses. Goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisitions were $44.8 million in 2001 and $52.1 million in 2000. The other intangible assets are being amortized over periods ranging from 2 to 20 years, with a weighted average life of 5.7 years. Unaudited pro forma results of operations information have not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions, individually or in the aggregate, were not significant to our results of operations or financial position. 29 Table of Contents Divestitures During 2000, we completed transactions to divest our workers’ compensation, north Florida Medicaid and Medicare supplement businesses. We estimated and recorded a $117.2 million loss in 1999 related to these divestitures. There was no subsequent change in the estimated loss. Divested assets, consisting primarily of investment securities and reinsurance recoverables, totaled $651.9 million. Divested liabilities, consisting primarily of workers’ compensation and other reserves, totaled $437.6 million. Cash proceeds received in 2000 were $97.1 million, net of direct transaction costs. Revenue associated with these businesses prior to divestiture for 2000 totaled $102.9 million or less than 1% of our consolidated 2000 revenues. Pretax losses totaled $8.4 million in 2000 related to these businesses. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements On January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, Accounting for Exit or Disposal Activities, or Statement 146. Statement 146 addresses the recognition, measurement, and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities, including certain lease termination costs and severance-type costs under a one-time benefit arrangement rather than an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred-compensation contract. Statement 146 requires liabilities associated with exit and disposal activities to be expensed as incurred and will impact the timing of recognition for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The effect of the adoption is dependent on exit or disposal activities, if any, initiated after December 31, 2002. In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34, or FIN 45. Fin 45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the entity must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee. FIN 45 requires disclosure about each guarantee even if the likelihood of the guarantor’s having to make any payments under the guarantee is remote. The provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of the recognition provision of FIN 45 will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The disclosure provisions of FIN 45 are effective for our December 31, 2002 financial statements. See “Liquidity” section and Note 12 in our consolidated financial statements for guarantee disclosures. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB 51, or FIN 46. The primary objectives of FIN 46 are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting right (variable interest entities, or VIEs) and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the VIE (the primary beneficiary). The provisions of FIN 46 are effective immediately for VIEs created after January 31, 2003 and no later than July 1, 2003 for VIEs created before February 1, 2003. In addition, FIN 46 requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest make additional disclosure in filings issued after January 31, 2003. The adoption of FIN 46 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In January 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure, or Statement 148. This Statement amends FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, Statement 148 amends the disclosure requirements of Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. See Notes 2 and 9 in our consolidated financial statements for our stock option 30 Table of Contents accounting policy and required disclosures. As now required by Statement 148, these disclosures will be updated each reporting period beginning with the first quarter of 2003. Comparison of Results of Operations for 2002 and 2001 The following table presents certain financial data for our two segments: For the year ended December 31, 2002 2001 (in thousands, except ratios) Premium revenues: Fully insured $ 5,499,033 $ 4,941,888 Specialty 337,295 304,714 Total Commercial 5,836,328 5,246,602 Medicare+Choice 2,629,597 2,909,478 TRICARE 2,001,474 1,341,557 Medicaid 462,998 441,324 Total Government 5,094,069 4,692,359 Total $ 10,930,397 $ 9,938,961 Administrative services fees: Commercial $ 103,203 $ 84,204 Government 141,193 52,886 Total $ 244,396 $ 137,090 Medical expense ratios: Commercial 83.5 % 83.1 % Government 83.8 % 83.6 % Total 83.6 % 83.3 % SG&A expense ratios: Commercial 17.5 % 17.6 % Government 13.3 % 12.8 % Total 15.6 % 15.3 % Income (loss) before income taxes: Commercial $ (15,174 ) $ (2,013 ) Government 225,108 185,093 Total $ 209,934 $ 183,080 31 Table of Contents The following table presents our medical membership at December 31, 2002 and 2001: December 31, Change 2002 2001 Members Percentage Commercial segment medical members: Fully insured 2,340,300 2,301,300 39,000 1.7 % ASO 652,200 592,500 59,700 10.1 % Total Commercial 2,992,500 2,893,800 98,700 3.4 % Government segment medical members: Medicare+Choice 344,100 393,900 (49,800 ) (12.6 )% Medicaid 506,000 490,800 15,200 3.1 % TRICARE 1,755,800 1,714,600 41,200 2.4 % TRICARE ASO 1,048,700 942,700 106,000 11.2 % Total Government 3,654,600 3,542,000 112,600 3.2 % Total medical membership 6,647,100 6,435,800 211,300 3.3 % Overview Net income was $142.8 million, or $0.85 per diluted share in 2002, compared to net income of $117.2 million, or $0.70 per diluted share in 2001. The increase in earnings resulted primarily from premium revenues increasing more than operating costs in both our Commercial and Government segments and the non-amortization of goodwill partially offset by the fourth quarter 2002 restructuring charge. Premium Revenues and Medical Membership Premium revenues increased 10.1% to $10.9 billion for 2002, compared to $9.9 billion for 2001. Higher premium revenues resulted primarily from significant commercial premium yields and an increase in TRICARE premiums. Premium yield represents the percentage increase in the average premium per member over the comparable period in the prior year. Items impacting premium yield include changes in premium rates, changes in government reimbursement rates, changes in geographic mix of membership, and changes in the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership. Commercial segment premium revenues increased 11.5% to $5.8 billion for 2002, compared to $5.2 billion for 2001. This increase resulted primarily from premium yields in the 12% to 14% range for 2002 on our fully insured commercial business. Additionally, our fully insured commercial medical membership increased 1.7% or 39,000 members, to 2,340,300 at December 31, 2002 compared to 2,301,300 at December 31, 2001. We have been pricing 2003 premiums using the assumption that medical cost trends will accelerate slightly and accordingly, anticipate 2003 Commercial premium yields in the 13% to 15% range. During 2003, we anticipate an increase in our fully insured commercial and administrative services (discussed below) medical membership of approximately 4% to 5%. Government segment premium revenues increased 8.5% to $5.1 billion for 2002, compared to $4.7 billion for 2001. This increase was primarily attributable to our TRICARE business, partially offset by a reduction in our Medicare+Choice membership. TRICARE premium revenues were $2.0 billion, an increase of $660 million, or 49.2% compared to 2001. $334 million of the increase in TRICARE premium revenues is attributable to the acquisition of Regions 2 and 5 on May 31, 2001, with the remainder of the increase attributable to the annual increase in our contractually determined base revenues and increases in premium revenues recorded as a result of bid price adjustments, or BPAs, and change orders. 32 Table of Contents Increasing premium revenues recorded in connection with BPAs resulted from an increase in the number of eligible TRICARE beneficiaries and a decrease in the use of military treatment facilities, or MTFs, by TRICARE beneficiaries. The number of TRICARE beneficiaries has increased as a result of the events of September 11, 2001, the subsequent build-up of military personnel to support military operations in Afghanistan and the continuing build-up of military personnel surrounding other international tensions. A decline in the usage of MTFs occurred for some periods after September 11, 2001 when certain MTFs were restricted by the Department of Defense resulting in a greater use of our provider network by retired military personnel and the dependents of both active duty and retired military personnel. Increasing premium revenues recorded in connection with change orders primarily resulted from expanded benefits for TRICARE beneficiaries as mandated by Congress which includes, among other items, a reduction of beneficiary out-of-pocket maximum cost and the elimination of certain copayments. Collectively, all of these actions resulted in higher medical expenses during 2002. Since these actions were not originally specified in our contracts, we were entitled to equitable revenue adjustments via the change order and bid price adjustment process. We recognized revenues related to these adjustments when the settlement amount became determinable and the collectibility was reasonably assured. Medicare+Choice premium revenues were $2.6 billion in 2002, a decrease of 9.6% from $2.9 billion in 2001. Medicare+Choice membership was 344,100 at December 31, 2002, compared to 393,900 at December 31, 2001, a decline of 49,800 members, or 12.6%. Premium yield was 5.6% for 2002. The decrease in membership was due to our exit of various counties on January 1, 2002, as well as attrition of some members selecting other plans in certain markets as a result of annual changes to benefit designs. Effective January 1, 2003, we exited several counties in some of our markets, affecting approximately 10,000 members. We expect that by the end of 2003 Medicare+Choice membership will be approximately 325,000 to 330,000 members. Administrative Services Fees Administrative services fees for 2002 were $244.4 million, an increase of $107.3 million from $137.1 million for 2001. For the Commercial segment, administrative services fees increased $19.0 million, or 22.6%, to $103.2 million. This increase corresponds to the higher level of ASO membership at December 31, 2002, which was 652,200 members, compared to 592,500 members at December 31, 2001 and also reflects an increase in the average fees received per member. Administrative services fees for the Government segment increased $88.3 million when comparing 2002 to 2001. $51 million of this increase was due to the TRICARE Regions 2 and 5 acquisition, with the remainder attributable to the implementation of the TRICARE for Life benefits program effective October 1, 2001. TRICARE for Life is a program for seniors where we provide medical benefit administrative services. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income totaled $86.4 million in 2002, a decrease of $32.4 million from $118.8 million in 2001. Net realized losses of $10.1 million in 2002 compared to net realized gains of $13.9 million in 2001. Net realized losses in 2002 included impairment losses of $19.6 million related to privately held venture capital investment securities after an evaluation indicated that a decline in fair value below the cost basis was other than temporary. Lower interest rates also decreased investment income $10.9 million in 2002 compared to 2001. The average yield on investment securities was 4.6% in 2002, declining from 5.1% in 2001. Medical Expense Total medical expenses as a percentage of premium revenues, or medical expense ratio, for 2002 was 83.6%, increasing 30 basis points from 83.3% for 2001. The Commercial segment medical expense ratio for 2002 was 83.5%, increasing 40 basis points from 83.1% for 2001. This increase primarily was due to the shift in the mix of our fully insured commercial medical 33 Table of Contents membership to a heavier concentration of larger group sizes. Large group commercial membership represents approximately 65% of our fully insured commercial membership at December 31, 2002 compared to 62% at December 31, 2001. Large group membership traditionally experiences a higher medical expense ratio and a lower selling, general and administrative expense ratio than does our small group membership. The Government segment medical expense ratio for 2002 was 83.8%, increasing 20 basis points from 83.6% for 2001. This increase primarily was attributable to TRICARE. As discussed previously, TRICARE medical expense increased due to expanded benefits for TRICARE beneficiaries mandated by Congress, an increase in eligible beneficiaries, and an increase in the use of Humana’s provider network rather than military treatment facilities. Since these actions were not originally specified in our contracts or were for items that the Department of Defense retains financial risk, we were entitled to equitable revenue adjustments through the change order and bid price adjustment processes. These higher medical expenses combined with the associated higher premium revenues resulted in an overall increase in the Government medical expense ratio. SG&A Expense Total selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses as a percentage of premium revenues and administrative services fees, or SG&A expense ratio, for 2002 was 15.6%, increasing 30 basis points from 15.3% for 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded $30.1 million of administrative expenses for a contingent contractual provider dispute and other items associated with our 1997 acquisition of Physician Corporation of America, or PCA. Of the total $30.1 million of administrative expenses, which amounts to a 30 basis point increase in the 2002 SG&A expense ratio, $28.4 million impacted our Commercial segment and $1.7 million impacted our Government segment. The Commercial segment’s SG&A expense ratio was 17.5% for 2002, decreasing 10 basis points from 2001 of 17.6%. The PCA items discussed above accounted for a 30 basis point increase in this ratio. The remaining 40 basis point decline in the SG&A ratio was driven primarily by the changing mix of members towards more larger group members and reductions in the number of our employees due to operational efficiencies gained from streamlining various processes through technology and other initiatives. Costs to distribute and administer our products to large group members are lower than that of small group members. The Government segment’s SG&A expense ratio was 13.3% for 2002, increasing 50 basis points compared to 12.8% in 2001. This increase resulted from a higher proportion of revenues generated from administrative services fees, primarily from the TRICARE Regions 2 and 5 acquisition and the implementation of the TRICARE for Life benefit programs effective October 1, 2001, as discussed above. ASO business carries a much higher SG&A ratio than fully insured business. We expect our total SG&A expense ratio to decline by approximately 80 basis points in 2003 due to our plan to realign our operating model around our commercial strategy and reductions in our administrative cost structure, including the consolidation of seven customer service centers into four and an enterprise-wide workforce reduction. Depreciation and amortization was $120.7 million in 2002, a decrease of $40.8 million, or 25.3%, from $161.5 million in 2001. On a comparable basis, depreciation and amortization was $106.5 in 2001, excluding goodwill amortization expense. The $14.2 million increase in 2002 compared to 2001, as adjusted, results from capital expenditures primarily related to our technology initiatives and the TRICARE acquisition of Regions 2 and 5 on May 31, 2001. Interest Expense Interest expense was $17.3 million in 2002, a decrease of $8.0 million from $25.3 million in 2001. This decrease primarily resulted from lower interest rates. 34 Table of Contents Income Taxes Our effective tax rate in 2002 of 32% decreased 4% compared to the 36% effective tax rate in 2001. The lower effective tax rate in 2002 primarily resulted from the cessation of non-deductible goodwill amortization on January 1, 2002, partially offset by higher state income taxes and a lower proportion of tax-exempt investment income to pretax income. In addition, during 2002, the Internal Revenue Service completed their audit of all open years prior to 2000 which resulted in a favorable adjustment to the estimated accrual for income taxes of approximately $32.6 million. This was offset by an increase of approximately $24.5 million in the capital loss valuation allowance after we reevaluated probable capital gain realization in the allowable carryforward period based upon our capital gain experience beginning in 2000 and consideration of alternative tax planning strategies. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete reconciliation to the federal statutory rate. We expect the effective tax rate for 2003 to increase to approximately 36% as a result of a lower proportion of tax-exempt investment income to pretax income and because we are not currently anticipating any favorable adjustments resulting from the completion of any IRS tax examinations during 2003. Comparison of Results of Operations for 2001 and 2000 The following table presents certain financial data for our two segments: For the year ended December 31, 2001 2000 (in thousands, except ratios) Premium revenues: Fully insured $ 4,941,888 $ 5,263,602 Specialty 304,714 291,315 Total Commercial 5,246,602 5,554,917 Medicare+Choice 2,909,478 3,286,351 TRICARE 1,341,557 892,375 Medicaid 441,324 660,988 Total Government 4,692,359 4,839,714 Total $ 9,938,961 $ 10,394,631 Administrative services fees: Commercial $ 84,204 $ 86,298 Government 52,886 — Total $ 137,090 $ 86,298 Medical expense ratios: Commercial 83.1 % 83.6 % Government 83.6 % 85.5 % Total 83.3 % 84.5 % SG&A expense ratios: Commercial 17.6 % 17.2 % Government 12.8 % 11.5 % Total 15.3 % 14.5 % Income (loss) before income taxes: Commercial $ (2,013 ) $ (7,954 ) Government 185,093 121,944 Total $ 183,080 $ 113,990 35 Table of Contents The following table presents our medical membership at December 31, 2001 and 2000: December 31, Change 2001 2000 Members Percentage Commercial segment medical members: Fully insured 2,301,300 2,545,800 (244,500 ) (9.6 )% ASO 592,500 612,800 (20,300 ) (3.3 )% Total Commercial 2,893,800 3,158,600 (264,800 ) (8.4 )% Government segment medical members: Medicare+Choice 393,900 494,200 (100,300 ) (20.3 )% Medicaid 490,800 575,600 (84,800 ) (14.7 )% TRICARE 1,714,600 1,070,300 644,300 60.2 % TRICARE ASO 942,700 — 942,700 100.0 % Total Government 3,542,000 2,140,100 1,401,900 65.5 % Total medical membership 6,435,800 5,298,700 1,137,100 21.5 % Overview Net income was $117.2 million, or $0.70 per diluted share in 2001, compared to net income of $90.1 million, or $0.54 per diluted share in 2000. This increase in earnings occurred despite an increase in our effective income tax rate from 21% in 2000 to 36% in 2001. The earnings increase resulted primarily from significant Medicare+Choice benefit reductions, improvements in determining appropriate premiums for our fully insured commercial medical membership (a process we refer to as pricing discipline) and divestitures of those products and markets that either lacked the prospect for long-term profitability or no longer fit our strategic focus. Premium Revenues and Medical Membership Premium revenues decreased 4.4% to $9.9 billion for 2001, compared to $10.4 billion for 2000. This decrease was due to medical membership reductions from exiting numerous markets and products, partially offset by higher premium revenues from our TRICARE acquisition on May 31, 2001, and premium yields in our commercial and Medicare+Choice products. Commercial segment premium revenues decreased 5.6% to $5.2 billion for 2001, compared to $5.6 billion for 2000. This decrease was due to membership reductions partially offset by premium yields on our fully insured commercial business. Our fully insured commercial medical membership decreased 9.6% or 244,500 members, to 2,301,300 at December 31, 2001 compared to 2,545,800 at December 31, 2000, as we continued to focus on opportunities that satisfy our pricing criteria, and exit non-core businesses. Government segment premium revenues decreased 3.0% to $4.7 billion for 2001, compared to $4.8 billion for 2000. This decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in our Medicare+Choice and Medicaid membership partially offset by higher Medicare+Choice premium yield in 2001, and higher premium revenues from our TRICARE acquisition on May 31, 2001. Medicare+Choice membership was 393,900 at December 31, 2001 compared to 494,200 at December 31, 2000, a decline of 100,300 members, or 20.3%. This decline in membership primarily was attributable to the exits from 45 Medicare counties on January 1, 2001. Medicaid membership was 490,800 at December 31, 2001 compared to 575,600 at December 31, 2000, a decline of 84,800 members. This decline resulted primarily from the divestiture of our north Florida, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Austin, San Antonio and Houston, Texas Medicaid businesses. For 2001, TRICARE premiums were $1.3 billion compared to $892.4 million for 2000, an increase of $449.2 million. Fully insured TRICARE membership increased by 644,300 members, or 60.2%, to 1,714,600 at December 31, 2001 compared to 1,070,300 at December 31, 2000 due to the TRICARE Regions 2 and 5 acquisition on May 31, 2001. This acquisition increased TRICARE fully insured medical members by approximately 648,000 members. 36 Table of Contents Administrative Services Fees Administrative services fees for 2001 were $137.1 million, an increase of $50.8 million from $86.3 million for 2000. This increase primarily was due to the TRICARE Regions 2 and 5 acquisition, and servicing medical benefits in an administrative capacity under a new TRICARE program for seniors, called TRICARE for Life, which began October 1, 2001. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income totaled $118.8 million in 2001, an increase of $3.8 million from $115.0 million in 2000. The increased investment and other income resulted from higher average invested balances partially offset by lower interest rates. Medical Expense Total medical expenses as a percentage of premium revenues, or medical expense ratio, for 2001 was 83.3%, decreasing 120 basis points from 84.5% for 2000. The improvement in the medical expense ratio primarily was due to significant benefit reductions in our Medicare+Choice product effective January 1, 2001, continued discipline in commercial pricing, and the exit of numerous higher cost markets and products during 2000. The Commercial segment medical expense ratio for 2001 was 83.1%, decreasing 50 basis points from 83.6% for 2000. The improvement in our Commercial medical expense ratio resulted primarily from exercising pricing discipline in our fully insured accounts. The Government segment medical expense ratio for 2001 was 83.6%, decreasing 190 basis points from 85.5% for 2000. This improvement primarily resulted from exiting 45 non-core counties in our Medicare+Choice business with higher medical expense ratios on January 1, 2001, coupled with significant benefit design changes which also became effective on that date. SG&A Expense Total selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses as a percentage of premium revenues and administrative services fees, or SG&A expense ratio, for 2001 was 15.3%, increasing 80 basis points from 14.5% in 2000. Similar increases occurred in the SG&A expense ratios of our Commercial and Government segments as indicated in the preceding table. These increases resulted from an increase in the mix of ASO membership, primarily from the TRICARE acquisition, and planned spending on infrastructure and technology initiatives. Depreciation and amortization was $161.5 million in 2001, an increase of $15.0 million, or 10.2%, from $146.5 million in 2000. This increase was the result of increased capital expenditures primarily related to our technology initiatives and the TRICARE acquisition on May 31, 2001. Interest Expense Interest expense was $25.3 million in 2001, a decrease of $3.3 million from $28.6 million in 2000. This decline was attributable to the impact from lower interest rates that were offset by higher average daily outstanding borrowings. A greater proportion of total debt outstanding during 2001 resulted from borrowings under our credit agreement, and later in the year under the 5-year senior notes issued in August 2001. These borrowings have longer maturities than borrowings under our commercial paper program, resulting in higher daily average outstanding borrowings in 2001 compared to 2000. As a result of this changing debt mix, daily cash in excess of our funding requirements was invested, causing higher average invested balances described above. 37 Table of Contents Income Taxes Our effective tax rate in 2001 was approximately 36% compared to a 21% effective tax rate in 2000. The lower effective tax rate in 2000 was the result of recognizing the benefit of capital loss carryforwards resulting from the sale of our workers’ compensation business. Liquidity The following table presents operating cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, excluding the effects of the timing of the Medicare+Choice premium receipts: For the years ended, 2002 2001 (in thousands) Cash flows provided by operating activities $ 321,408 $ 148,958 Timing of Medicare+Choice premium receipts 10,873 16,815 Normalized cash flows provided by operating activities $ 332,281 $ 165,773 The Medicare+Choice premium receipt is payable to us on the first day of each month. When the first day of a month falls on a weekend or holiday, we receive this payment at the end of the previous month. This receipt is significant, the timing of which can cause material fluctuation in operating cash flows. Normalized operating cash flows assume these monthly receipts were received in the month in which they are applicable, providing a better comparison. Normalized operating cash flows were $332.3 million in 2002, compared to $165.8 million in 2001, an increase of $166.5 million. This increase primarily was attributable to higher net income and an increase in medical and other expenses payable partially offset by higher TRICARE receivables. Medical and other expenses payable increased $55.7 million during 2002, primarily as a result of membership growth, the timing of our payment to our third-party pharmacy benefit administrator, and increases in medical claims trend partially offset by a reduction in unprocessed claim inventories and a decrease in claim receipt cycle time. Medical and other expenses payable declined $179.5 million during 2001 due to reductions in both unprocessed claim inventories on-hand and membership levels. Throughout 2001, and to a lesser extent during 2002, we reduced the level of unprocessed claim inventories, a direct result of our focused effort to improve service and operational efficiencies. The pace of claim inventory reduction slowed during 2002 to $33.1 million compared to $132.0 million for 2001. The following table presents the estimated valuation and number of unprocessed claims on hand. Claims on hand represent the estimated number of provider requests for reimbursement that have been received but not yet processed. Estimated Valuation Claims On Hand Number of Days Claims On-hand (in thousands) December 31, 2000 $ 257,400 1,157,900 11.0 December 31, 2001 $ 125,400 518,100 5.0 December 31, 2002 $ 92,300 424,200 4.1 38 Table of Contents Total net premium and ASO receivables increased to $416.9 million, or 27.8%, during 2002 primarily related to TRICARE, as presented in the following table: December 31, Change 2002 2001 Dollars Percentage (in thousands) TRICARE: Base receivable $ 197,544 $ 166,763 $ 30,781 18.5 % Bid price adjustments (BPAs) 104,044 — 104,044 100.0 % Change orders 57,630 18,423 39,207 212.8 % 359,218 185,186 174,032 94.0 % Less: long-term portion of BPAs (86,471 ) — (86,471 ) 100.0 % TRICARE subtotal 272,747 185,186 87,561 47.3 % Commercial and other 174,309 179,621 (5,312 ) (3.0 )% Allowance for doubtful accounts (30,178 ) (38,539 ) 8,361 (21.7 )% Total net receivables $ 416,878 $ 326,268 $ 90,610 27.8 % TRICARE receivables increased primarily due to change orders and bid price adjustments previously discussed. We collect the TRICARE base receivables monthly in the ordinary course of business. The timing of BPA collections occurs at contractually specified intervals, typically in excess of 6 months after the end of a contract year for our largest regions. We classified a portion of the total BPA receivables associated with our Regions 3 and 4 TRICARE contract as long-term because the federal government is not obligated to pay us the amounts until January 2004. We also have a BPA amount payable within one year under the Regions 3 and 4 contract of approximately $23 million at December 31, 2002, which is classified in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets. Change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year. We expect to collect the change order receivable balance of $57.6 million no later than the second quarter of 2003. Due to the build-up of military personnel and other items previously discussed, we expect TRICARE receivables to increase from the $359 million level at December 31, 2002 to a range of $415 million to $465 million at December 31, 2003. The allowance for doubtful accounts of $30.2 million at December 31, 2002, which relates entirely to commercial and other receivables, decreased from $38.5 million at December 31, 2001. This decline resulted from a reduction in past due accounts, improved collections and operating efficiencies related to the billing and enrollment system. Capital Expenditures Our ongoing capital expenditures relate primarily to our technology initiatives and administrative facilities necessary for activities such as claims processing, billing and collections, medical utilization review and customer service. Total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were $112.1 million in 2002, $115.5 million in 2001, and $135.1 million in 2000. Excluding acquisitions, we expect our total capital expenditures in 2003 to be approximately $105 million, most of which will be used for our technology initiatives and improvement of administrative facilities. Stock Repurchase Plan In July 2002, the Board of Directors authorized the use of up to $100 million in total for the repurchase of our common shares. The shares may be purchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the open-market, by block purchases, or in privately-negotiated transactions. We have engaged Lehman Brothers Inc. and Banc of America Securities, LLC to broker these transactions. As of December 31, 2002, we had purchased 6.4 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $74.0 million, or $11.56 per share. Since December 31, 2002 and 39 Table of Contents through February 26, 2003, we had purchased 2.2 million more shares for an aggregate purchase price of $20.8 million, or $9.31 per share. The total remaining share repurchase authorization as of February 26, 2003 was $5.2 million. Debt The following table presents our short-term and long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2002 and 2001: December 31, 2002 2001 (in thousands) Short-term debt: Conduit commercial paper financing program $ 265,000 $ 263,000 Long-term debt: Senior notes $ 334,368 $ 309,789 Other long-term borrowings 5,545 5,700 Total long-term debt $ 339,913 $ 315,489 Senior Notes The $300 million 7¼% senior, unsecured notes are due August 1, 2006. In order to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of our $300 million 7¼% senior notes attributable to fluctuations in interest rates, we entered into interest rate swap agreements. Interest rate swap agreements, which are considered derivatives, are contracts that exchange interest payments on a specified principal amount, or notional amount, for a specified period. Our interest rate swap agreements exchange the 7¼% fixed interest rate under our senior notes for a variable interest rate, which was 3.06% at December 31, 2002. The $300 million swap agreements mature on August 1, 2006, and have the same critical terms as our senior notes. Changes in the fair value of the 7¼% senior notes and the swap agreements due to changing interest rates are assumed to offset each other completely, resulting in no impact to earnings from hedge ineffectiveness. Our swap agreements are recognized in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with an equal and offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of our senior notes. The fair value of our swap agreements are estimated based on quoted market prices of comparable agreements and reflects the amounts we would receive (or pay) to terminate the agreements at the reporting date. At December 31, 2002, the $34.9 million fair value of our swap agreements is included in other long-term assets. Likewise, the carrying value of our senior notes has been increased $34.9 million to its fair value. The counterparties to our swap agreements are major financial institutions with which we also have other financial relationships. Credit Agreements We maintain two unsecured revolving credit agreements consisting of a $265 million, 4-year revolving credit agreement and a $265 million, 364-day revolving credit agreement with a one-year term out option. A one year term out option converts the outstanding borrowings, if any, under the credit agreement to a one year term loan upon expiration. The 4-year revolving credit agreement expires in October 2005. In October 2002, we renewed the 364-day revolving credit agreement which expires in October 2003, unless extended. There were no balances outstanding under either agreement at December 31, 2002. Under these agreements, at our option, we can borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis. The revolving credit portion of both agreements bear interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on LIBOR plus a spread. The spread, which varies depending on our credit ratings, ranges from 80 to 125 basis points for our 4-year agreement, and 85 to 137.5 basis points for our 364-day agreement. We also pay an annual facility fee 40 Table of Contents regardless of utilization. This facility fee, currently 25 basis points, may fluctuate between 15 and 50 basis points, depending upon our credit ratings. The competitive advance portion of any borrowings under either credit agreement will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate basis, at our option. These credit agreements contain customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default, including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of net worth, and minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios. The terms of each of these credit agreements also include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing, including a customary material adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to borrow. We have not experienced a material adverse effect and we know of no circumstances or events which would be reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect. We do not believe the material adverse effect clause poses a material funding risk to Humana in the future. The minimum net worth requirement was $1,163.4 million at December 31, 2002 and increases by 50% of consolidated net income each quarter. The minimum interest coverage ratio is generally calculated by dividing interest expense into earnings before interest and tax expense, or EBIT. The maximum leverage ratio is generally calculated by dividing debt into earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, or EBITDA. EBIT and EBITDA used to calculate compliance with these financial covenants is based upon four consecutive quarters. The current minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.5, increases to 4.0 effective December 31, 2003. The current maximum leverage ratio of 2.75 declines to 2.5 effective December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2002, our net worth of $1,606.5 million, interest coverage ratio of 13.7, and leverage ratio of 1.7 were all in compliance with the applicable requirements. Additionally, we would have been in compliance assuming the more restrictive future financial covenant requirements were applicable at December 31, 2002. Commercial Paper Programs We maintain indirect access to the commercial paper market through our conduit commercial paper financing program. Under this program, a third party issues commercial paper and loans the proceeds of those issuances to us so that the interest and principal payments on the loans match those on the underlying commercial paper. The $265 million, 364-day revolving credit agreement supports the conduit commercial paper financing program of up to $265 million. The weighted average interest rate on our conduit commercial paper borrowings was 1.76% at December 31, 2002. The carrying value of these borrowings approximates fair value as the interest rate on the borrowings varies at market rates. We also maintain and may issue short-term debt securities under a commercial paper program when market conditions allow. The program is backed by our credit agreements described above. Aggregate borrowing under both the credit agreements and commercial paper program cannot exceed $530 million. Other Borrowings Other borrowings of $5.5 million at December 31, 2002 represent financing for the renovation of a building, bear interest at 2% and are payable in various installments through 2014. Shelf Registration On October 8, 2002, we filed a universal shelf registration with the SEC to register debt or equity securities, from time to time, up to a total of $600 million, with the amount, price and terms to be determined at the time of the sale. Once it becomes effective, we will have the ability to use the net proceeds from any future sales of our securities for our operations and for other general corporate purposes, including repayment or refinancing of borrowings, working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, or the repurchase of our outstanding securities. 41 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to December 31, 2002 as follows: Payments Due by Period Total 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years After 5 Years (in thousands) Debt $ 604,913 $ 265,623 $ 1,283 $ 335,482 $ 2,525 Operating leases 264,491 63,471 87,990 54,989 58,041 Total $ 869,404 $ 329,094 $ 89,273 $ 390,471 $ 60,566 Debt payments could be accelerated upon violation of debt covenants. We believe the likelihood of a debt covenant violation is remote. We lease facilities, computer hardware, and other equipment under long-term operating leases that are noncancelable and expire on various dates through 2017. We sublease facilities or partial facilities to third party tenants for space not used in our operations which partially mitigates our operating lease commitments. An operating lease is a type of off-balance sheet arrangement. Assuming we acquired the asset, rather than leased, we would have recognized a liability for the financing of these assets. See also Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Our 5-year and 7-year airplane operating leases which are included above provide for a residual value guarantee of no more than $17.9 million at the end of the lease terms which expire December 29, 2004 for the 5-year leases and January 1, 2010 for the 7-year lease. We have the right to exercise a purchase option with respect to the leased equipment or the equipment can be sold to a third party. If we decide not to exercise our purchase option at the end of the lease, we must pay the lessor a maximum amount of $13.1 million related to the 5-year leases and $4.8 million related to the 7-year lease. The amount will be reduced by the net sales proceeds of the airplanes to a third party. A $3.5 million gain in connection with a 1999 sale/leaseback transaction is being deferred until the residual value guarantee is resolved at the end of the lease term. We do not believe that we will have any payment obligation at the end of the lease because we will exercise the purchase obligation, or the net proceeds from the sale of the airplanes will exceed the maximum amount payable to the lessor. We have $23.8 million in undrawn letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2002. Letters of credit totaling $10.9 million have been issued to ensure our payment to a beneficiary for assumed obligations of our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary related to pre-1993 professional liability risks for which the beneficiary remains directly liable. Other letters of credit totaling $12.9 million were issued to ensure our payment to various beneficiaries for miscellaneous contractual obligations. These letters of credit renew automatically on an annual basis unless the beneficiary otherwise notifies us. In February 2003, a $5.0 million letter of credit supporting miscellaneous contractual obligations of ours expired without renewal. Over the past 10 years, we have not had to fund any letters of credit. Through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities, certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by Humana Inc., our parent company, in the event of insolvency for (1) member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency; (2) benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged; and (3) payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency. Other Liquidity Factors Our investment grade credit rating at December 31, 2002 was Baa3 according to Moody’s Investors Services, Inc., or Moody’s and BBB, according to Standard & Poor’s Corporation, or S&P. A downgrade to Ba2 or lower by Moody’s and BB or lower by S&P would give the counterparty of one of our interest rate swap agreements with a $100 million notional amount, the right, but not the obligation, to cancel the interest rate swap agreement. If cancelled, we would pay or receive an amount based on the fair market value of the swap 42 Table of Contents agreement. Assuming this swap agreement had been cancelled on December 31, 2002, we would have received $34.9 million. Other than the swap agreement, adverse changes in our credit ratings will not create, increase, or accelerate any liabilities. Adverse changes in our credit rating will increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future. Related Parties No related party transactions had a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Certain immaterial related party transactions are discussed in our Proxy Statement for the meeting to be held May 15, 2003 – see “Certain Transactions with Management and Others.” Regulatory Requirements Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., our parent company, require minimum levels of equity, and limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required. As of December 31, 2002, we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $1,006.9 million in our state regulated health insurance subsidiaries. Each of these subsidiaries was in compliance with applicable statutory requirements which aggregated $576.0 million. Although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume, product mix, and the quality of assets held, minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level. Certain states rely on risk-based capital requirements, or RBC, to define the required levels of equity. RBC is a model developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to monitor an entity’s solvency. This calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels. Some states are in the process of phasing in these RBC requirements over a number of years. If RBC were fully implemented by all states at December 31, 2002, each of our subsidiaries would be in compliance, and we would have $358.8 million of aggregate capital and surplus above the minimum level required under RBC. One TRICARE subsidiary under the Regions 3 and 4 contract with the Department of Defense is required to maintain current assets at least equivalent to its current liabilities. We were in compliance with this requirement at December 31, 2002. Future Liquidity Needs We believe that funds from future operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreements and commercial paper program are sufficient to meet future liquidity needs. We also believe these sources of funds are adequate to allow us to fund selected expansion opportunities, as well as to fund capital requirements. Market Risk-Sensitive Financial Instruments and Positions The level of our pretax earnings is subject to risk due to changes in investment income from our fixed income portfolio which is partially offset by both our debt position and the short-term duration of the fixed income investment portfolio. We evaluated the impact on our investment income and debt expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100, 200 and 300 basis points over the next twelve-month period, as reflected in the following table. The modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt, which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelve-month 43 Table of Contents period. This evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may effect interest income, including, among others, unexpected changes of cash flow into and out of the portfolio, shifts in the asset mix between tax and tax-exempt securities, and spread changes specific to various investment categories. In the past ten years, annual changes in 3 month LIBOR rates have exceeded 300 basis points twice, have not changed between 200 and 300 basis points and have changed between 100 and 200 basis points once. LIBOR was 1.38% at December 31, 2002. Our model assumed the maximum possible reduction in LIBOR could not exceed 138 basis points.

These publicly-traded equity securities are held for purposes other than trading.

Government Contracts Our Medicare+Choice contracts with the federal government are renewed for a one-year term each December 31 unless terminated 90 days prior thereto. Legislative proposals are being considered which may revise the Medicare+Choice program’s current reimbursement rates. We are unable to predict the outcome of these proposals or the impact they may have on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We currently are in negotiations with the Department of Defense to extend our TRICARE contracts that expire on April 30, 2003 for Regions 2 and 5 and June 30, 2003 for Regions 3 and 4. We believe we will be able to successfully extend our TRICARE contracts under substantially the same terms for one additional year plus a 44 Table of Contents one year renewal option which should continue our contracts through the new TRICARE Next Generation, or T-Nex, transition described below. Historical pretax profit margins for our TRICARE business have generally ranged from 2 to 4 percent. We expect margins to continue in this range during 2003. The Department of Defense recently announced a plan to consolidate the total number of prime contracts from seven to three under the new T-Nex program. The Department of Defense has stated that a bidder can be awarded only one prime contract, although a bidder would be allowed to secondarily participate in another contract. We submitted a bid in January 2003 to participate as a prime contractor for the South region. Additionally, we partnered with Aetna Government Health Plans, LLC, a subsidiary of Aetna, Inc. to participate as a subcontractor should Aetna Government Health Plans, LLC be awarded the North region. An announcement of the awards is expected in mid to late 2003 with transition to the new regions not expected until mid to late 2004. At this time we are unable to predict whether we will be awarded a contract, or the effective date of the contract. If we are a successful bidder on the South region, we do not expect a material change to our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, although TRICARE profits could decline slightly. TRICARE membership would not materially change from current levels. TRICARE revenues and expenses would decline by approximately 20% as a result of certain benefits, e.g. pharmacy, which are included under our current contract, being excluded and under separate T-Nex contracts in the future. Effective July 1, 2002, we signed two contracts in Puerto Rico covering beneficiaries in two of the eight regions in Puerto Rico’s Medicaid program, which represents 86% of our total Medicaid membership as of December 31, 2002. The term of each of these contracts is three years, subject to annual renewal options with the Health Insurance Administration in Puerto Rico. Our Medicaid contracts in Florida and Illinois generally are annual contracts. The loss of any of these government contracts or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action, including reductions in premium payments to us, or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Legal Proceedings We are party to a variety of legal actions in the ordinary course of business, including employment matters, breach of contract actions, tort claims, and shareholder suits involving alleged securities fraud. A description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under “Legal Proceedings” of Item 3 in Part 1. We cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty, and we are incurring expenses in defense of these matters. In addition, recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. Therefore, these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Cautionary Statements This document includes both historical and forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are made within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and we are including this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, among other things, the information discussed below. In making these statements, we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results. Our business is highly complicated, regulated and competitive with many different factors affecting results. 45 Table of Contents If the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members, or if our estimates of medical claim reserves are inadequate, our profitability could decline. We use a significant portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members. These costs include claims payments, capitation payments, allocations of some centralized expenses and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members. These costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members. Generally, premiums in the health care business are fixed for one-year periods. Accordingly, costs we incur in excess of our medical cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums. We estimate the costs of our future medical claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns, medical inflation, historical developments, including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns, and other relevant factors. We also record medical claims reserves for future payments. We continually review estimates of future payments relating to medical claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves. However, increased utilization or unit cost, competition, government regulations and many other factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums. These factors may include: • increased use of medical facilities and services, including prescription drugs; • increased cost of such services; • termination of capitation arrangements resulting in the transfer of membership to fee-for-service arrangements; • changes or reductions of our utilization management functions such as preauthorization of services, concurrent review or requirements for physician referrals; • catastrophes or epidemics; • the introduction of new or costly treatments, including new technologies; • medical cost inflation; • new government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes; and • increased use of health care, including doctors’ office visits and prescriptions resulting from terrorists’ attacks and subsequent terrorists threats, including bioterrorism. Failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient medical claim reserves may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. If we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our future performance depends in large part upon our management team’s ability to execute our strategy to position the company for the future. This strategy includes the growth of our Commercial segment business, introduction of new products and benefit designs, the successful implementation of our e-business initiatives and the selection and adoption of new technologies. We believe that the adoption of new technologies will contribute toward a reduction in administrative costs as we more closely align our workforce with our membership. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to position the company for future growth. Failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 46 Table of Contents If we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, our membership and profitability could decline. We are in a highly competitive industry. Many of our competitors are more established in the health care industry and have a larger market share and greater financial resources than we do in some markets. In addition, other companies may enter our markets in the future. Contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually. While health plans compete on the basis of many factors, including service and the quality and depth of provider networks, we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition. In addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs, we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices. Premium increases, introduction of new product designs, and our relationship with our providers in various markets, among others, could affect our membership levels. Other actions that could affect membership levels include the possible exit of Medicare+Choice service and the exit of commercial products in some markets. If we do not compete effectively in our markets, if membership does not increase as we expect, or if it declines, or if we lose accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If we fail to manage prescription drug costs successfully, our financial results could suffer. In general, prescription drug costs have been rising over the past few years. These increases are due to the introduction of new drugs costing significantly more than existing drugs, direct consumer advertising by the pharmaceutical industry that creates consumer demand for particular brand-name drugs, and members seeking medications to address lifestyle changes. In order to control prescription drug costs, we have implemented multi-tiered copayment benefit designs for prescription drugs, including our four-tiered copayment benefit design, Rx4. We are also evaluating other multi-tiered designs. We cannot assure that these efforts will be successful in controlling costs. Failure to control these costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We are involved in various legal actions, which, if resolved unfavorably to us, could result in substantial monetary damages. We are a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business, including employment and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims and shareholder suits involving alleged securities fraud. We and some of our competitors in the health benefits business are defendants in a number of purported class action lawsuits. These include separate suits against us and five of our competitors that purport to be brought on behalf of members of managed care plans, which we refer to as the subscriber track cases. In addition, there is a single action against us and eight of our competitors that purports to be brought on behalf of health care providers, which we refer to as the provider track case. These suits allege breaches of federal statutes, including ERISA and RICO. In addition, because of the nature of the health care business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations, including the design, management and offering of products and services. These include and could include in the future: • claims relating to the denial of health care benefits; • challenges to the use of some software products used in administering claims; • medical malpractice actions; • allegations of anti-competitive and unfair business activities; 47 Table of Contents • provider disputes over compensation and termination of provider contracts; • disputes related to self-funded business, including actions alleging claim administration errors; • claims related to the failure to disclose some business practices; and • claims relating to customer audits and contract performance. In some cases, substantial non-economic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal False Claims Act, RICO and other statutes may be sought. While we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities, other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded. In addition, some types of damages, like punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance, particularly in those jurisdictions in which coverage of punitive damages is prohibited. Insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future. A description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under “Legal Proceedings” of Item 3 in Part I. We cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty, and we are incurring expenses in the defense of these matters. In addition, recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. Therefore, these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. As a government contractor, we are exposed to additional risks that could adversely affect our business or our willingness to participate in government health care programs. A significant portion of our revenues relates to federal, state and local government health care coverage programs, including the Medicare+Choice, Medicaid and TRICARE programs. These programs involve various risks, including: • the possibility of reduced or insufficient government reimbursement in the future; • the possibility that we will not be able to extend or renew any of the contracts relating to these programs. These contracts also are generally subject to frequent change, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll, reduce the revenue we receive or increase our administrative or health care costs under those programs. We currently are in negotiations with the Department of Defense to extend our TRICARE contracts that expire on April 30, 2003 for Regions 2 and 5 and June 30, 2003 for Regions 3 and 4. We believe we will be able to successfully extend our TRICARE contracts under substantially the same terms for one additional year plus a one year renewal option which should continue our contracts through the new TRICARE Next Generation, or T-Nex. In the event government reimbursement were to decline from projected amounts, our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business. Changes to these government programs in the future may also affect our ability or willingness to participate in these programs. The loss of these contracts or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action, including reductions in payments or increases in benefits without corresponding increases in payments, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; • at December 31, 2002, under one of our CMS contracts, we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 228,400 members in Florida. This contract accounted for approximately 16% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2002. The termination of this contract would likely have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; • higher comparative medical costs; 48 Table of Contents • government regulatory and reporting requirements; • higher marketing and advertising costs per member as a result of marketing to individuals as opposed to groups; • the possibility of temporary or permanent suspension from participating in government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, if we are convicted of fraud or other criminal conduct in the performance of a health care program or if there is an adverse decision against us under the federal False Claims Act; and • state budget constraints. Increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business. The managed care industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry. This publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation, including some large jury awards, legislative activity, regulation and governmental review of industry practices. These factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services, may require us to change our products or services, may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines. Any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our industry is currently subject to substantial government regulation, which, along with possible increased governmental regulation or legislative reform, increases our costs of doing business and could adversely affect our profitability. The health care industry in general, and health management organizations, or HMOs, and preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, in particular, are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation, including: • regulation relating to minimum net worth; • licensing requirements; • approval of policy language and benefits; • mandated benefits and processes; • provider compensation arrangements; • member disclosure; • premium rates; and • periodic examinations by state and federal agencies. State regulations require our licensed, operating subsidiaries to maintain minimum net worth requirements and restrict some investment activities. Additionally, those regulations restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividend payments, loans, loan repayments or other payments to us. In recent years, significant federal and state legislation affecting our business has been enacted. State and federal governmental authorities are continually considering changes to laws and regulations applicable to us and are currently considering regulations relating to: • mandatory benefits and products, including a Medicare pharmacy benefit or discount card; • rules tightening time periods in which claims must be paid; • patients’ bill of rights; 49 Table of Contents • defining medical necessity; • health insurance access; • provider compensation and contract language; • disclosure of provider fee schedules and other data impacting payments to providers; • health plan liability to members who fail to receive appropriate care; • disclosure and composition of physician networks; • physicians’ ability to collectively negotiate contract terms with carriers, including fees; and • mental health parity. All of these proposals could apply to us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses or that legislative or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals, or moratoria imposed by regulatory authorities, could adversely affect our revenue or the number of our members, increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, has adopted risk-based capital requirements, also known as RBC, which is subject to state-by-state adoption and to the extent implemented, sets minimum capitalization requirements for insurance and HMO companies. The NAIC recommendations for life insurance companies were adopted in all states and the prescribed calculation for HMOs has been adopted in most states in which we operate. The HMO rules may increase the minimum capital required for some of our subsidiaries. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions, establishing uniform health care provider, payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data. Under the new HIPAA standard transactions and code sets rules, we must make significant systems enhancements and invest in new technological solutions. The compliance date for standard transactions and code sets rules has been extended to October 17, 2003 based on our submission of a compliance plan, including work plan and implementation strategy to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Under the new HIPAA privacy rules, by April 14, 2003 we must comply with a variety of requirements concerning the use and disclosure of individuals’ protected health information, establish rigorous internal procedures to protect health information and enter into business associate contracts with those companies to whom protected health information is disclosed. Regulations issued in February 2003 set standards for the security of electronic health information requiring compliance by April 21, 2005. Violations of these rules will subject us to significant penalties. Compliance with HIPAA regulations requires significant systems enhancements, training and administrative effort. The final rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws, but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent. HIPAA could also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates. Another area receiving increased focus in 2002 is the time in which various laws require the payment of health care claims. Many states already have legislation in place covering payment of claims within a specific number of days. However, due to provider groups advocating for laws or regulations establishing even stricter standards, procedures and penalties, we expect additional regulatory scrutiny and supplemental legislation with respect to claims payment practices. The provider-sponsored bills are characterized by stiff penalties for late payment, including high interest rates payable to providers and costly fines levied by state insurance departments and attorneys general. This legislation and possible future regulation and oversight could expose our Company to additional liability and penalties. 50 Table of Contents On November 21, 2000, the Department of Labor published its final regulation on claims and appeals review procedures under ERISA. The claims procedure regulation applies to all employee benefit plans governed by ERISA, whether benefits are provided through insurance products or are self-funded. As a result, the new claims and appeals review regulation impacts nearly all employer and union-sponsored health and disability plans, except church and government plans. Similar to legislation recently passed by many states, the new ERISA claims and appeals procedures impose shorter and more detailed procedures for processing and reviewing claims and appeals. According to the Department of Labor, however, its ERISA claims and appeals regulation does not preempt state insurance and utilization review laws that impose different procedures or time lines, unless complying with the state law would make compliance with the new ERISA regulation impossible. Unlike its state counterparts, the ERISA claims and appeals rule does not provide for independent external review to decide disputed medical questions. Instead, the federal regulation will generally make it easier for claimants to avoid state-mandated internal and external review processes and to file suit in federal court. The new ERISA claims and appeals rules generally became effective July 1, 2002 or the first day of the first plan year beginning after July 1, 2002, whichever is later. In any case, health plans must comply with the new rules with respect to all claims filed on or after January 1, 2003. We are also subject to various governmental audits and investigations. These can include audits and investigations by state attorneys general, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, the Office of the Inspector General of Health and Human Services, the Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Justice and state Departments of Insurance and Departments of Health. These activities could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in various programs, or the imposition of fines, penalties and other sanctions. In addition, disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services. If we fail to maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members, our business could be adversely affected. We contract with physicians, hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members. Our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers. These providers may share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a cost-effective manner. In any particular market, providers could refuse to contract with us, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us, less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, some providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions and negotiating power. In addition, physician or practice management companies, which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage, may, in some cases, compete directly with us. If these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected. We currently are in negotiations with HCA Inc. regarding our contracts in Florida covering 30 hospitals, which expire on April 30, 2003. Although we have included estimated hospital rate increases in our Commercial premium rates and in our Medicare benefit designs, we are currently unable to predict the outcome of these negotiations, but believe such outcome will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In some situations, we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care physicians for an actuarially determined, fixed, per-member-per-month fee under which physicians are paid an amount to provide all required medical services to our members (i.e. capitation). The inability of providers to properly manage costs under these arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship 51 Table of Contents with us. In addition, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. The financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us, even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider. There can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. Our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted. Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of Humana Inc., the parent company. These subsidiaries generally are regulated by state departments of insurance. In most states, we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts, or, in some states, any amount. We are also required by law to maintain specific proscribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. One TRICARE subsidiary under the Regions 3 and 4 contract with the Department of Defense is required to maintain assets at least equivalent to its current liabilities. In addition, we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval. ITEM 7a.

49071,HUM,HUMANA INC,2004,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The consolidated financial statements of Humana Inc. in this document present the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis. References to “we,” “us,” “our,” “Company,” and “Humana” mean Humana Inc. and its subsidiaries. This discussion includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this filing and in future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases, investor presentations, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words or phrases like “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “likely will result,” “estimates,” “projects” or variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including, among other things, information set forth in the “Cautionary Statements” section of this document. Because our pending acquisition has not yet occurred, these forward looking statements exclude its impact. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed in this document might not occur. There may also be other risks that we are unable to predict at this time. Any of these risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Overview Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, Humana Inc. is one of the nation’s largest publicly traded health benefits companies, based on our 2003 revenues of $12.2 billion. We offer coordinated health insurance coverage and related services through a variety of traditional and Internet-based plans for employer groups, government-sponsored programs, and individuals. As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately 6.8 million members in our medical insurance programs, as well as approximately 1.7 million members in our specialty products programs. In 2003, approximately 70% of our premiums and administrative services fees resulted from members located in Florida, Illinois, Texas, Kentucky, and Ohio. During 2003, we derived approximately 42% of our premiums and administrative services fees from contracts with the federal government including two federal government contracts with the Department of Defense to provide health insurance coverage to TRICARE beneficiaries and our contracts with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, to provide health insurance coverage for our Medicare+Choice members. We manage our business with two segments: Commercial and Government. The Commercial segment consists of members enrolled in products marketed to employer groups and individuals, and includes three lines of business: fully insured medical, administrative services only, or ASO, and specialty. The Government segment consists of members enrolled in government-sponsored programs, and includes three lines of business: Medicare+Choice, Medicaid, and TRICARE. Our Government segment has produced consistent profits and relatively stable margins for many years. Our business strategy largely revolves around increasing our Commercial segment profitability while building on our existing strength in the Government segment. Our strategy to increase Commercial segment profitability focuses on providing solutions for employers to the rising cost of health care through the use of innovative and consumer-choice product designs which are supported by service excellence and industry-leading electronic capabilities, including education, tools and technologies provided primarily through the Internet. To that end, we have developed an innovative suite of products styled as “Smart” products. We believe that these Smart products offer the best solution for many employers to the problem of fast rising health care costs for their employees. Although enrollment in our Smart products is a relatively modest 130,000 members at December 31, 2003, we believe that substantial growth in these products, which may be competitively priced to produce higher margins, is the key for our continuing improvement in the Commercial segment. January 2004 sales were approximately 70,000 in our Smart products. Other important elements which impact our Commercial segment profitability are the competitive pricing environment and market conditions. With respect to pricing, there is the balancing act between sustaining or 24 Table of Contents increasing underwriting margins versus achieving enrollment growth. With respect to market conditions, there is the impact of economies of scale on administrative overhead. As a result of the decline in popularity of tightly managed HMOs and intensive utilization review procedures, medical costs become increasingly comparable among the larger competitors, with product design and consumer involvement then becoming the more important drivers of medical services consumption. As a result, administrative expense efficiency is becoming a primary driver of commercial margin sustainability. In line with that philosophy, we continue to reduce our administrative expense structure, realize administrative expense savings through technology tools, and look at acquisition opportunities that align with our geographic presence and Commercial strategy. In December 2003, we announced that we had reached a definitive agreement with the Ochsner Clinic Foundation of New Orleans, Louisiana to acquire Ochsner Health Plan. We believe that this acquisition will enhance our presence in the Southern United States, an area growing in population and commercial activity. In addition to creating a new Humana market in New Orleans, the Ochsner Health Plan acquisition is expected to facilitate sales opportunities in our existing Houston market and is anticipated to make us more attractive to national accounts. In our Government segment, there were two significant developments in 2003. First, in August 2003, our subsidiary, Humana Military Healthcare Services, or HMHS, was awarded the Department of Defense’s TRICARE contract to support healthcare delivery to active duty and retired service members and their families in the South Region beginning in 2004. The South Region is one of the three regions in the United States as defined by the Department of Defense’s new contract alignment. Under the terms of the award, HMHS will be the Managed Care Support Contractor serving approximately 2.8 million TRICARE beneficiaries in Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. Most importantly, procurement of the South Region contract positions us to continue our TRICARE operating margins consistent with the levels we have enjoyed since beginning the TRICARE program in July 1996. Second, in December 2003 President Bush signed Medicare modernization legislation that provides stabilization funding for the Medicare+Choice program and may provide longer-term opportunities for Humana, including the potential to (1), expand the Company’s current Medicare+Choice market presence, (2), become a MedicareAdvantage Regional PPO, (3), add an Interim Drug Discount Card, and (4), become a Prescription Drug Standalone Plan. We are evaluating these potential opportunities and anticipate completing our analysis during 2004. We believe the new Medicare legislation demonstrates the federal government’s financial commitment to the private payor program and the commitment to providing health benefits and options to seniors, which should translate to stable, if not increasing, participation from Humana in this sector. During 2003, our revenue increased by almost $1 billion to $12.2 billion versus $11.3 billion the previous year. 80% of the revenue increase was derived from our Commercial segment, primarily a result of underwriting our premiums commensurate with underlying medical cost inflation. The leveraging of this increase in underwriting dollars in excess of administrative and overhead expenses was the primary driver of the increase in our commercial and consolidated pretax profits. During the second quarter of 2003, we completed a transition from seven service centers to four, which has resulted in continuing administrative efficiencies. Cash flows from operations generated $413.1 million during 2003, $44.1 million of which was used to purchase 3.7 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $12.03 per share. We invested $101.3 million on capital expenditures during 2003. We intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain critical accounting principles and estimates impact our financial statements. 25 Table of Contents Pending Acquisition In December 2003, we reached a definitive agreement to purchase Ochsner Health Plan from Ochsner Clinic Foundation having approximately 152,000 Commercial medical members, primarily in fully insured large group accounts, and approximately 36,000 members in the Medicare+Choice program. This transaction, which is subject to state regulatory approval, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2004. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to medical cost and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities, goodwill, and long-lived assets. These estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events, and accordingly, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Medical Expense Recognition Medical expenses are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported, or IBNR. IBNR represents a substantial portion of our medical and other expenses payable as follows: December 31,2003 Percentage ofTotal December 31,2002 Percentage ofTotal (dollars in thousands) IBNR $ 1,034,858 81.3 % $ 863,432 75.6 % Reported claims in process 183,962 14.5 % 197,722 17.3 % Pharmacy and other medical expenses payable 53,336 4.2 % 80,977 7.1 % Total medical and other expenses payable $ 1,272,156 100.0 % $ 1,142,131 100.0 % Estimating IBNR is complex, involves a significant amount of judgment and represents a material portion of our medical and other expenses payable. Accordingly, it represents a critical accounting estimate. Changes in this estimate can materially affect, either favorably or unfavorably, our results from operations and overall financial position. For example, a 100 basis point, or 1 percent, change in the estimate of our medical and other expenses payable at December 31, 2003, which represents approximately 40% of total liabilities, would require an adjustment of approximately $13 million in a future period in which a revision in the estimate became known. We develop our estimate for IBNR using actuarial methodologies and assumptions, primarily based upon historical claim payment and claim receipt patterns, as well as historical medical cost trends. Depending on the period for which incurred claims are estimated, we apply a different method in determining our estimate. For periods prior to the most recent three months, the key assumption used in estimating our IBNR is that the completion factor pattern remains consistent over a rolling 12-month period after adjusting for known changes in claim inventory levels or known changes in claim payment processes. The completion factor is a calculation of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have historically been adjudicated as of the reporting period. For the most recent three months, the incurred claims are estimated primarily from a trend analysis based upon per member per month claims trends developed from our historical experience in the preceding months, adjusted for known changes in estimates of recent hospital and drug utilization data, provider contracting changes, changes in benefit levels, product mix, and weekday seasonality. 26 Table of Contents The completion factor method is used for the months of incurred claims prior to the most recent three months because the historical percentage of claims processed for those months is at a level sufficient to produce a consistently reliable result. Conversely, for the most recent three months of incurred claims, the volume of claims processed historically is not at a level sufficient to produce a reliable result, which therefore requires us to examine historical trend patterns as the primary method of evaluation. Medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy. The drivers of medical cost trends include increases in the utilization of hospital and physician services, prescription drugs, and new medical technologies, as well as the inflationary effect on the cost per unit of each of these expense components. Other external factors such as government-mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, catastrophes, and epidemics also may impact medical cost trends. Additionally, as we realign our commercial strategy, we continue to reduce the level of traditional utilization management functions such as pre-authorization of services, monitoring of inpatient admissions, and requirements for physician referrals. Other internal factors such as system conversions and claims processing interruptions also may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends. All of these factors are considered in estimating IBNR and in estimating the per member per month claims trend for purposes of determining the reserve for the most recent three months. Each of these factors requires significant judgment by management. The completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the IBNR estimate. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on December 31, 2003 data: Completion Factor (a): Claims Trend Factor (b): (Decrease)Increasein Factor Increase(Decrease) inMedical andOther ExpensesPayable (Decrease)Increasein Factor Increase(Decrease) inMedical andOther ExpensesPayable (dollars in thousands) (3%) $ 136,000 (3 %) $ (59,000 ) (2%) $ 88,000 (2 %) $ (41,000 ) (1%) $ 43,000 (1 %) $ (22,000 ) 1% $ (40,000 ) 1 % $ 14,000 2% $ (79,000 ) 2 % $ 33,000 3% $ (116,000 ) 3 % $ 51,000 (a) Reflects estimated potential changes in medical and other expenses payable caused by changes in completion factors for incurred months prior to the most recent three months. (b) Reflects estimated potential changes in medical and other expenses payable caused by changes in annualized claims trend used for the estimation of per member per month incurred claims for the most recent three months. Most medical claims are paid within a few months of the member receiving service from a physician or other health care provider. As a result, these liabilities generally are described as having a “short-tail”, which causes less than 2% of our medical and other expenses payable as of the end of any given period to be outstanding for more than 12 months. As such, we expect that substantially all of the 2003 estimate of medical and other expenses payable will be known and paid during 2004. Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards. Actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for IBNR have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient, or such that the liabilities established for IBNR are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. Adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are 27 Table of Contents expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate. Therefore, in many situations, the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice. IBNR established in connection with our TRICARE contracts is typically more difficult to estimate than with our other operations, as a result of having more variables which impact the estimate. Such variables include continual changes in the number of eligible beneficiaries, changes in the utilization of military treatment facilities and changes in levels of benefits versus the original contract provisions. Many of these variables are impacted significantly by an increase or decrease in military activity involving the United States armed forces. Our TRICARE contracts contain risk-sharing provisions with the Department of Defense and with subcontractors, which effectively limit profits and losses when actual claim experience varies from the medical claim amounts included in our annual bids. Additionally, other factors impacting medical claims expenses such as changes in the number of eligible beneficiaries and changes in the level of usage of military treatment facilities result in equitable revenue adjustments through the change order and bid price adjustment process. As a result of the above contract provisions, the impact of changes in estimates for prior year TRICARE medical claims payable on our results of operations is reduced substantially, whether positive or negative. The following table provides a reconciliation of changes in medical and other expenses payable for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001: 2003 2002 2001 (in thousands) Balances at January 1 $ 1,142,131 $ 1,086,386 $ 1,181,027 Acquisitions — — 85,052 Incurred related to: Current year 9,955,491 9,125,915 8,303,256 Prior years (76,070 ) 12,281 (23,412 ) Total incurred 9,879,421 9,138,196 8,279,844 Paid related to: Current year (8,710,393 ) (8,002,610 ) (7,291,541 ) Prior years (1,039,003 ) (1,079,841 ) (1,167,996 ) Total paid (9,749,396 ) (9,082,451 ) (8,459,537 ) Balances at December 31 $ 1,272,156 $ 1,142,131 $ 1,086,386 Amounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims are ultimately settled. Negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims being ultimately settled for amounts less than originally estimated (favorable development). Positive amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims ultimately being settled for amounts greater than originally estimated (unfavorable development). As summarized in the previous table, claim reserve balances at December 31, 2000 ultimately settled during 2001 for $23.4 million less than the amounts originally estimated, representing 0.3% of medical claim expenses recorded in 2000. During 2002, claim reserve balances at December 31, 2001 ultimately settled for $12.3 million more than the amounts originally estimated, representing 0.1% of medical claim expenses recorded in 2001. This $35.7 million increase in the amounts incurred related to prior years was substantially all attributable to our TRICARE operations and resulted primarily from enhanced benefits enacted for TRICARE beneficiaries as a result of Congressional legislation, the impact of which was not fully determinable at December 31, 2001. As these additional medical expenses were recognized during 2002, we also recognized and received commensurate revenues from the Department of Defense as a result of change orders and bid price adjustments, or BPAs. 28 Table of Contents During 2003, claim reserve balances at December 31, 2002 ultimately settled for $76.1 million less than the amounts originally recorded, representing 0.8% of medical claim expenses recorded in 2002. This $88.4 million decline in the amounts incurred related to prior years consists of $68.3 million attributable to our TRICARE operations with the remaining $20.1 million primarily resulting from fourth quarter 2002 utilization in our commercial medical products ultimately being lower than originally estimated. The $68.3 million increase in TRICARE incurred related to prior years resulted from establishing the reserves resulting from the enhanced benefits for TRICARE beneficiaries as discussed above as well as lower than originally estimated utilization of medical services by TRICARE beneficiaries in the second half of 2002. Revenue Recognition We generally establish one-year contracts with commercial employer groups, subject to cancellation by the employer group’s 30-day written notice. Our contracts with federal or state governments are generally multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions with the exception of our Medicare+Choice contracts with the federal government which renew annually. Our commercial contracts establish rates on a per member basis for each month of coverage. Except for TRICARE contracts discussed in the following section, our government contracts also establish monthly rates per member but may have additional amounts due to us based on items such as age, working status, or specific health issues of the member. Premium revenues and ASO fees are estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates. In addition, we adjust revenues for, estimated changes in an employer’s enrollment and customers that ultimately may fail to pay. Enrollment changes not yet reported by an employer group, an individual, or the government, also known as retroactive membership adjustments, are based on historical trends. We monitor the collectibility of specific accounts, the aging of receivables, as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, and reflect any required adjustments in the current period’s revenue. We bill and collect premium and ASO fee remittances from employer groups, the federal and state governments, and individual Medicare+Choice members monthly. Premium and ASO fee receivables are presented net of allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts and retroactive membership adjustments. Premiums and ASO fees received prior to the period members are entitled to receive services are recorded as unearned revenues. TRICARE Revenues Base premium revenues as originally specified in our TRICARE contracts are recognized ratably throughout each contract year as eligible beneficiaries are entitled to receive services. TRICARE revenues also include amounts recoverable from the federal government as a result of BPAs and change orders. Under our TRICARE contracts, we retain the financial risk of contractual discounts in the provider networks, same-store utilization of services, and administrative overhead. However, the federal government retains the financial risk associated with changes in usage levels at military treatment facilities, or MTFs, changes in the number of persons eligible for TRICARE benefits, and medical unit cost inflation. BPAs are utilized to retroactively adjust premium revenues for the impact of the items for which the federal government retains risk. We work closely with the federal government to obtain and review eligibility and MTF workload data, and to quantify and negotiate amounts recoverable or payable under our contractual BPA requirements. We record revenues applicable to BPAs when these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. Because final settlement of BPAs occurs only at specified intervals, typically in excess of 6 months after the end of a contract year for our largest regions, cumulative amounts receivable or payable under BPAs may be outstanding in excess of a year. Amounts receivable or payable within a year are classified as premiums receivable or trade accounts payable and accrued expenses, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets. Amounts receivable or payable for longer than one year are classified as other long-term assets or other long-term liabilities, respectively. The increase in activity and deployments surrounding military conflicts in the Middle East has significantly impacted BPA activity in recent years. 29 Table of Contents TRICARE change orders occur when we perform services or incur costs under the directive of the federal government that were not originally specified in our contracts. Under federal regulations we are entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price, which results in additional premium revenues. Examples of items that have necessitated substantial change orders in recent years include congressionally legislated increases in the level of benefits for TRICARE beneficiaries and the administration of new government programs such as TRICARE for Life and TRICARE Senior Pharmacy. Like BPAs, we record revenue applicable to change orders when these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. Unlike BPAs, where settlement only occurs at specified intervals, change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year. Total TRICARE premium and ASO fee receivables were as follows at December 31, 2003 and 2002: 2003 2002 (in thousands) TRICARE premiums receivable: Base receivable $ 254,688 $ 190,339 Bid price adjustments (BPAs) 92,875 104,044 Change orders 7,073 1,400 Subtotal 354,636 295,783 Less: long-term portion of BPAs (38,794 ) (86,471 ) Total TRICARE premiums receivable $ 315,842 $ 209,312 TRICARE ASO fees receivable: Base receivable $ — $ 7,205 Change orders 11,968 56,230 Total TRICARE ASO fees receivable $ 11,968 $ 63,435 Our TRICARE contracts also contain risk-sharing provisions with the federal government to minimize any losses and limit any profits in the event that medical costs for which we are at risk differ from the levels targeted in our contracts. Amounts receivable from the federal government under such risk-sharing provisions are included in the BPA receivable above, while amounts payable to the federal government under these provisions of approximately $17.3 million at December 31, 2003 are included in medical and other expenses payable in our consolidated balance sheets. Investment Securities Investment securities totaled $1,995.8 million, or 38% of total assets at December 31, 2003. Debt securities totaled $1,960.6 million, or 98% of our total investment portfolio. More than 94% of our debt securities were of investment-grade quality, with an average credit rating of AA by Standard & Poor’s at December 31, 2003. Most of the debt securities that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end (B or better) of the non-investment grade spectrum. Our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types. Duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in market value to changes in interest rates, providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our debt securities to changes in interest rates. However, actual market values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration. The average duration of our debt securities was approximately 3.5 years at December 31, 2003. Based on this duration, a 1% increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our debt securities by approximately $70 million. Our investment securities are categorized as available for sale and, as a result, are stated at fair value. Fair value of publicly traded debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices. Non-traded debt securities are priced independently by a third party vendor. Fair value of venture capital debt securities that are privately 30 Table of Contents held, or where an observable quoted market price does not exist, are estimated using a variety of valuation methodologies. Such methodologies include reviewing the value ascribed to the most recent financing, comparing the security with securities of publicly traded companies in a similar line of business, and reviewing the underlying financial performance including estimating discounted cash flows. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of applicable deferred taxes, are included as a component of stockholders’ equity until realized from a sale or impairment. Gross unrealized losses and fair value, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at December 31, 2003, included the following: Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total Fair Value UnrealizedLosses Fair Value UnrealizedLosses Fair Value UnrealizedLosses (in thousands) U.S. Government obligations $ 251,218 $ (2,125 ) $ — $ — $ 251,218 $ (2,125 ) Tax exempt municipal securities 90,705 (1,566 ) 21,979 (494 ) 112,684 (2,060 ) Corporate and other securities 121,184 (3,674 ) 714 (4 ) 121,898 (3,678 ) Mortgage-backed securities 47,060 (1,295 ) — — 47,060 (1,295 ) Redeemable preferred stocks — — 21,348 (734 ) 21,348 (734 ) Debt securities 510,167 (8,660 ) 44,041 (1,232 ) 554,208 (9,892 ) Equity securities — — 7,162 (285 ) 7,162 (285 ) Long-term investment securities $ 510,167 $ (8,660 ) $ 51,203 $ (1,517 ) $ 561,370 $ (10,177 ) We regularly evaluate our investment securities for impairment. We consider factors affecting the investee, factors affecting the industry the investee operates within, and general debt and equity market trends. We consider the length of time an investment’s fair value has been below carrying value, the near term prospects for recovery to carrying value and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or market recovery is realized. If and when a determination is made that a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary, the related investment is written down to its estimated fair value through earnings. The risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations; facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time; or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment. The determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment. The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments. The status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment. Unrealized losses at December 31, 2003 resulted from 96 positions. Less than 3% of the carrying value of our consolidated investment securities have been in an unrealized loss position greater than one year. The unrealized losses at December 31, 2003 generally can be attributed to changes in interest rates. All securities trading at an unrealized loss remain current on all contractual payments and we believe it is probable that we will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the debt securities. After taking into account these and other factors, including our ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery or maturity, we determined the unrealized losses on these investment securities were temporary. We recorded impairment losses of $3.2 million in 2003, $27.2 million in 2002, and $2.4 million in 2001 after an evaluation indicated that a decline in fair value below the cost basis was other than temporary. Goodwill and Long-lived Asset At December 31, 2003, goodwill and other long-lived assets represented 23% of total assets and 65% of total stockholders’ equity. 31 Table of Contents In accordance with the adoption of an accounting standard on January 1, 2002, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is no longer amortized but must be tested at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. A reporting unit is one level below our Commercial and Government segments. The Commercial segment’s two reporting units consist of fully and self-insured medical and specialty. The Government segment’s three reporting units consist of Medicare+Choice, TRICARE and Medicaid. Goodwill was assigned to the reporting unit that was expected to benefit from a specific acquisition. If goodwill was expected to benefit multiple reporting units, we allocated goodwill in connection with our transitional impairment test as of January 1, 2002 based upon the reporting units’ relative fair value. This process resulted in the allocation of $633.2 million of goodwill to the Commercial segment and $143.7 million of goodwill to the Government segment. Our strategy, long-range business plan, and annual planning process supports our goodwill impairment tests. These tests are based primarily on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows under several scenarios. We used a range of discount rates that correspond to our weighted-average cost of capital. Key assumptions including changes in membership, premium yields, medical cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our long-range business plan and annual planning process. If these assumptions differ from actual, the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected. Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment and other intangible assets. These assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life, and are subject to impairment reviews. We periodically review long-lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. In assessing recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist, and, if so, estimate fair value. We also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long-lived assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life, including accelerating depreciation for these assets. We recognized losses due to impairment and accelerated depreciation from changes in estimated useful life of $30.8 million in 2003, $2.4 million in 2002 and none in 2001. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements On December 17, 2003, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or the “Staff”) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition, or SAB 104, which supercedes Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, or SAB 101. SAB 104’s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in SAB 101 related to multiple element revenue arrangements, superceded as a result of the issuance of EITF 00-21, “Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” Additionally, SAB 104 rescinds the SEC’s Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements Frequently Asked Questions and Answers, or the FAQ, issued with SAB 101 that had been codified in SEC Topic 13, Revenue Recognition. Selected portions of the FAQ have been incorporated into SAB 104. While the wording of SAB 104 has changed to reflect the issuance of EITF 00-21, the revenue recognition principles of SAB 101 remain largely unchanged by the issuance of SAB 104. The provisions of SAB 104 do not have an impact on our current revenue recognition policies. In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB 51, or FIN 46. The primary objectives of FIN 46 are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights (variable interest entities, or VIEs) and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the VIE (the primary beneficiary). In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46-R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities—an interpretation of ARB 51 (revised December 2003), which replaces FIN 46. FIN 46-R incorporates certain modifications to FIN 46 adopted by the FASB subsequent to the issuance of FIN 46, including modifications to the scope of FIN 46. Additionally, FIN 46-R incorporates much of the guidance previously issued in the form of FASB Staff Positions. 32 Table of Contents For all special purpose entities (“SPEs”) created prior to February 1, 2003, public entities must apply either the provisions of FIN 46 or early adopt the provisions of FIN 46-R at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. If a public entity applies FIN 46 for such period, the provisions of FIN 46-R must be applied as of the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after March 15, 2004. For all non-SPEs created prior to February 1, 2003, public entities will be required to adopt FIN 46-R at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after March 15, 2004. For all entities (regardless of whether the entity is an SPE) that were created subsequent to January 31, 2003, public entities were already required to apply the provisions of FIN 46, and should continue doing so unless they elect to early adopt the provisions of FIN 46-R as of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. If they do not elect to early adopt FIN 46-R, public entities would be required to apply FIN 46-R to those post-January 31, 2003 entities as of the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after March 15, 2004. As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or SPEs, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of December 31, 2003, we are not involved in any SPE transactions. The adoption of FIN 46 or FIN 46-R is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 33 Table of Contents Comparison of Results of Operations for 2003 and 2002 Certain financial data for our two segments was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002: Change 2003 2002 Dollars Percentage (in thousands, except ratios) Premium revenues: Fully insured $ 6,240,806 $ 5,499,033 $ 741,773 13.5 % Specialty 320,206 337,295 (17,089 ) (5.1 )% Total Commercial 6,561,012 5,836,328 724,684 12.4 % Medicare+Choice 2,527,446 2,629,597 (102,151 ) (3.9 )% TRICARE 2,249,725 2,001,474 248,251 12.4 % Medicaid 487,100 462,998 24,102 5.2 % Total Government 5,264,271 5,094,069 170,202 3.3 % Total $ 11,825,283 $ 10,930,397 $ 894,886 8.2 % Administrative services fees: Commercial $ 122,846 $ 103,203 $ 19,643 19.0 % Government 148,830 141,193 7,637 5.4 % Total $ 271,676 $ 244,396 $ 27,280 11.2 % Income (loss) before income taxes: Commercial $ 121,010 $ (15,174 ) $ 136,184 897.5 % Government 223,706 225,108 (1,402 ) (0.6 )% Total $ 344,716 $ 209,934 $ 134,782 64.2 % Medical expense ratios: Commercial 82.9 % 83.5 % (0.6 ) Government 84.3 % 83.8 % 0.5 Total 83.5 % 83.6 % (0.1 ) SG&A expense ratios: Commercial 16.9 % 18.0 % (1.1 ) Government 13.4 % 13.5 % (0.1 ) Total 15.4 % 15.9 % (0.5 ) Medical membership was as follows at December 31, 2003 and 2002: Change 2003 2002 Members Percentage Commercial segment medical members: Fully insured 2,352,800 2,340,300 12,500 0.5 % ASO 712,400 652,200 60,200 9.2 % Total Commercial 3,065,200 2,992,500 72,700 2.4 % Government segment medical members: Medicare+Choice 328,600 344,100 (15,500 ) (4.5 )% Medicaid 468,900 506,000 (37,100 ) (7.3 )% TRICARE 1,849,700 1,755,800 93,900 5.3 % TRICARE ASO 1,057,200 1,048,700 8,500 0.8 % Total Government 3,704,400 3,654,600 49,800 1.4 % Total medical membership 6,769,600 6,647,100 122,500 1.8 % 34 Table of Contents Overview Net income was $228.9 million, or $1.41 per diluted share, in 2003 compared to net income of $142.8 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, in 2002. The increase in earnings resulted primarily from significant improvement in operating earnings for the Commercial segment and a decrease in expenses for asset impairments and other unusual items. Premium Revenues and Medical Membership Premium revenues increased 8.2%, to $11.8 billion, for 2003 compared to $10.9 billion for 2002. Higher premium revenues resulted primarily from increases in fully insured commercial per member premiums and an increase in TRICARE premiums. Items impacting per member premiums include changes in premium and government reimbursement rates, as well as changes in geographic mix of membership, the mix of product offerings, and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership. Commercial segment premium revenues increased 12.4%, to $6.6 billion, for 2003 compared to $5.8 billion for 2002. This improvement resulted primarily from increases in per member premiums in the 12% to 14% range for 2003 on our fully insured commercial business. Additionally, our fully insured commercial medical membership increased 0.5% or 12,500 members, to 2,352,800 at December 31, 2003 compared to 2,340,300 at December 31, 2002. We anticipate 2004 Commercial fully insured per member premiums will increase approximately 8% to 10%. This reduction in the rate of increase in Commercial fully insured per member premiums is expected to occur as a result of a changing mix of business, reductions in the level of benefits purchased by our customers, and a more competitive pricing environment. The change in the mix of business, which is expected to result from growth in our individual products and changes in the products purchased by our large group customers, and reductions in the level of benefit purchased will result in a commensurate reduction in medical cost trends. We expect Commercial fully insured and ASO medical membership to achieve a combined increase for all of 2004 of between 6% and 9%, with most of the growth occurring in the ASO business. Government segment premium revenues increased 3.3%, to $5.3 billion, for 2003 compared to $5.1 billion for 2002. This increase primarily was attributable to our TRICARE business, partially offset by a reduction in our Medicare+Choice membership. Rates were increased upon annual renewal of our base TRICARE contract and led to an increase in TRICARE premium revenues of $248.3 million, or 12.4%, compared to 2002. Medicare+Choice membership was 328,600 at December 31, 2003 compared to 344,100 at December 31, 2002, a decline of 15,500 members, or 4.5%. This decline resulted as we exited several counties in some of our markets effective January 1, 2003 and general attrition in certain markets as a result of annual changes to benefit designs. Per member premiums increased in the 4% to 6% range for 2003. Due to DIMA, we are expecting a return to growth, with MedicareAdvantage membership increasing to approximately 340,000 to 360,000 members by the end of 2004 and increases in per member premiums in the range of 8% to 10%. Administrative Services Fees Administrative services fees for 2003 were $271.7 million, an increase of $27.3 million from $244.4 million for 2002. For the Commercial segment, administrative services fees increased $19.6 million, or 19.0%, to $122.8 million. This increase corresponds to the higher level of ASO membership at December 31, 2003, which was 712,400 members, compared to 652,200 members at December 31, 2002 and also reflects an increase in the average fees received per member. Administrative services fees for the Government segment increased $7.6 million when comparing 2003 to 2002. This increase resulted from contractual adjustments related to TRICARE for Life, a program for seniors in which we provide medical benefit administrative services. 35 Table of Contents Investment and Other Income Investment and other income totaled $129.4 million in 2003, an increase of $43.0 million from $86.4 million in 2002. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in net realized capital gains due to a $15.2 million gain from the sale of a venture capital investment and lower investment impairment losses, a result of an improving market. We recorded investment impairment losses of $3.2 million in 2003 compared to $27.2 million in 2002. Higher average invested balances offset lower interest rates. The average yield on investment securities was 3.5% in 2003, declining from 4.6% in 2002. Medical Expense Total medical expenses as a percentage of premium revenues, or medical expense ratio (MER), for 2003 were 83.5%, decreasing 10 basis points from 83.6% for 2002. The Commercial segment medical expense ratio for 2003 was 82.9%, decreasing 60 basis points from 83.5% for 2002. The improvement in the MER primarily resulted from per member premium rate increases in excess of medical cost trends for our large group customers and the attrition of groups with higher medical expense ratios. We expect the Commercial segment MER to increase between 100 to 130 basis points in 2004 primarily due to competitive pricing pressures and the pass through of increased administrative expense efficiencies to customers in the form of lower rates. The Government segment medical expense ratio for 2003 was 84.3%, increasing 50 basis points from 83.8% for 2002. This increase primarily was attributable to TRICARE as a result of having a higher level of BPA activity in the prior year. SG&A Expense Total selling, general and administrative, or SG&A, expenses as a percentage of premium revenues and administrative services fees, or SG&A expense ratio, decreased 50 basis points in 2003 primarily because of a decrease in severance and related employee benefit costs of $29.0 million, the absence of 2002 expenses of $30.1 million associated with a contingent contractual provider dispute and other items, offset by an increase in building impairments of $14.8 million. Increased operating efficiency led to the consolidation of seven service centers into four and an enterprise-wide workforce reduction affecting administrative expenses in both 2003 and 2002 by recording expenses for severance and related employee benefit costs and building impairments. Severance and related employee benefit costs, more fully described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, amounted to $11.2 million in 2003 and $40.2 million in 2002. The 2002 severance amount primarily related to the service center consolidation. Building impairments, more fully described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, amounted to $17.2 million in 2003 and $2.4 million in 2002. During 2002, we recorded $30.1 million of administrative expenses for a contingent contractual provider dispute and other items associated with our 1997 acquisition of Physician Corporation of America, or PCA. The $30.1 million of expenses in 2002 resulted from three issues. First, on January 28, 2003, we settled a dispute with a provider for $8.3 million primarily regarding old claims of PCA subsidiaries dating prior to Humana’s 1997 acquisition. Second, during the fourth quarter of 2002, as a December 2, 2002 trial date approached, efforts intensified to reach settlement of an old PCA shareholder dispute for periods prior to Humana’s 1997 acquisition of PCA. As a result, we accrued $15.7 million because the loss was probable and the amount could be reasonably estimated. We reversed $1.8 million of this reserve when the final settlement was paid during the third quarter of 2003. Third, in connection with an agreement reached in November 2002, we partially wrote-off a note receivable of $6.1 million from the purchaser of our workers’ compensation business which was sold in 2000. The agreement with the purchaser resulted when a significant customer contract was terminated in the fourth quarter of 2002. We acquired the workers’ compensation business in connection with the 1997 PCA acquisition. 36 Table of Contents The Commercial and Government segments’ SG&A expense ratios likewise were impacted by the same items described previously. Operational efficiencies gained from completing the consolidation of the service centers and workforce reductions, as well as increases in premiums in excess of inflationary trends on administrative expenses, are expected to decrease the Commercial segment’s SG&A expense ratio to a range of 15.5% to 16.5% and the Government segment’s SG&A expense ratio to a range of 11.0% to 12.0% in 2004. Depreciation and amortization was $126.8 million in 2003, an increase of $6.1 million, or 5.0%, from $120.7 million in 2002. The increase results from accelerated depreciation of software in 2003 of $13.5 million, as more fully described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, partially offset by lower amortization related to other intangible assets as costs associated with the government contract acquired with the TRICARE 2 and 5 transaction became fully amortized in the second quarter of 2003. Interest Expense Interest expense was $17.4 million in 2003, an increase of $0.1 million from $17.3 million in 2002. This increase primarily resulted from higher average outstanding debt due to the issuance of $300 million senior notes in August 2003 offset by lower interest rates. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate in 2003 of 33.6% increased 1.6% compared to the 32% effective tax rate in 2002. The increase in the effective tax rate primarily resulted from a lower proportion of tax-exempt investment income to pretax income. During 2002, the Internal Revenue Service completed their audit of all open years prior to 2000 which resulted in a favorable adjustment to the estimated accrual for income taxes of approximately $32.6 million. This was offset by an increase of approximately $24.5 million in the capital loss valuation allowance after we reevaluated probable capital gain realization in the allowable carryforward period based upon our capital gain experience beginning in 2000 and consideration of alternative tax planning strategies. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete reconciliation to the federal statutory rate. 37 Table of Contents Comparison of Results of Operations for 2002 and 2001 Certain financial data for our two segments was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001: Change 2002 2001 Dollars Percentage (in thousands, except ratios) Premium revenues: Fully insured $ 5,499,033 $ 4,941,888 $ 557,145 11.3 % Specialty 337,295 304,714 32,581 10.7 % Total Commercial 5,836,328 5,246,602 589,726 11.2 % Medicare+Choice 2,629,597 2,909,478 (279,881 ) (9.6 )% TRICARE 2,001,474 1,341,557 659,917 49.2 % Medicaid 462,998 441,324 21,674 4.9 % Total Government 5,094,069 4,692,359 401,710 8.6 % Total $ 10,930,397 $ 9,938,961 $ 991,436 10.0 % Administrative services fees: Commercial $ 103,203 $ 84,204 $ 18,999 22.6 % Government 141,193 52,886 88,307 167.0 % Total $ 244,396 $ 137,090 $ 107,306 78.3 % Income (loss) before income taxes: Commercial $ (15,174 ) $ (2,013 ) $ (13,161 ) 653.8 % Government 225,108 185,093 40,015 21.6 % Total $ 209,934 $ 183,080 $ 26,854 14.7 % Medical expense ratios: Commercial 83.5 % 83.1 % 0.4 Government 83.8 % 83.6 % 0.2 Total 83.6 % 83.3 % 0.3 SG&A expense ratios: Commercial 18.0 % 17.6 % 0.4 Government 13.5 % 12.8 % 0.7 Total 15.9 % 15.3 % 0.6 Medical membership was as follows at December 31, 2002 and 2001: Change 2002 2001 Members Percentage Commercial segment medical members: Fully insured 2,340,300 2,301,300 39,000 1.7 % ASO 652,200 592,500 59,700 10.1 % Total Commercial 2,992,500 2,893,800 98,700 3.4 % Government segment medical members: Medicare+Choice 344,100 393,900 (49,800 ) (12.6 )% Medicaid 506,000 490,800 15,200 3.1 % TRICARE 1,755,800 1,714,600 41,200 2.4 % TRICARE ASO 1,048,700 942,700 106,000 11.2 % Total Government 3,654,600 3,542,000 112,600 3.2 % Total medical membership 6,647,100 6,435,800 211,300 3.3 % 38 Table of Contents Overview Net income was $142.8 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, in 2002 compared to net income of $117.2 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, in 2001. The increase in earnings primarily resulted from premium revenues increasing more than operating costs in both our Commercial and Government segments and the non-amortization of goodwill partially offset by expenses for asset impairments and other unusual items. Premium Revenues and Medical Membership Premium revenues increased 10.0%, to $10.9 billion, for 2002 compared to $9.9 billion for 2001. Higher premium revenues resulted primarily from significant increases in fully insured commercial per member premiums and an increase in TRICARE premiums. Items impacting per member premiums include changes in premium and government reimbursement rates, as well as changes in geographic mix of membership, the mix of product offerings, and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership. Commercial segment premium revenues increased 11.2%, to $5.8 billion, for 2002 compared to $5.2 billion for 2001. This increase primarily resulted from increases in fully insured commercial per member premiums in the 12% to 14% range for 2002. Additionally, our fully insured commercial medical membership increased 1.7% or 39,000 members, to 2,340,300 at December 31, 2002 compared to 2,301,300 at December 31, 2001. Government segment premium revenues increased 8.5%, to $5.1 billion, for 2002 compared to $4.7 billion for 2001. This increase was primarily attributable to our TRICARE business, partially offset by a reduction in our Medicare+Choice membership. TRICARE premium revenues were $2.0 billion, an increase of $660 million or 49.2% compared to 2001. $334 million of the increase in TRICARE premium revenues is attributable to the acquisition of TRICARE Regions 2 and 5 on May 31, 2001, with the remainder of the increase attributable to the annual increase in our contractually determined base revenues and increases in premium revenues recorded as a result of bid price adjustments, or BPAs, and change orders. Increasing premium revenues recorded in connection with BPAs resulted from an increase in the number of eligible TRICARE beneficiaries and a decrease in the use of military treatment facilities, or MTFs, by TRICARE beneficiaries. The number of TRICARE beneficiaries increased in 2002 as a result of the events of September 11, 2001, the subsequent build-up of military personnel to support military operations in Afghanistan, and the continuing build-up of military personnel surrounding other international tensions. A decline in the usage of MTFs occurred for some periods after September 11, 2001 when certain MTFs were restricted by the Department of Defense resulting in a greater use of our provider network by retired military personnel and the dependents of both active duty and retired military personnel. Increasing premium revenues recorded in connection with change orders primarily resulted from expanded benefits for TRICARE beneficiaries as mandated by Congress which includes, among other items, a reduction of the beneficiary out-of-pocket maximum cost and the elimination of certain copayments. Collectively, all of these actions resulted in higher medical expenses during 2002. Since these actions were not originally specified in our contracts, we were entitled to equitable revenue adjustments via the change order and BPA process. We recognized revenues related to these adjustments when the settlement amount became determinable and the collectibility was reasonably assured. Medicare+Choice premium revenues were $2.6 billion in 2002, a decrease of 9.6% from $2.9 billion in 2001. Medicare+Choice membership was 344,100 at December 31, 2002, compared to 393,900 at December 31, 2001, a decline of 49,800 members, or 12.6%. Medicare+Choice per member premiums increased 5.6% in 2002. The decrease in membership was due to our exit of various counties on January 1, 2002, as well as attrition in certain markets as a result of annual changes to benefit designs. 39 Table of Contents Administrative Services Fees Administrative services fees for 2002 were $244.4 million, an increase of $107.3 million from $137.1 million for 2001. For the Commercial segment, administrative services fees increased $19.0 million, or 22.6%, to $103.2 million. This increase corresponds to the higher level of ASO membership at December 31, 2002, which was 652,200 members, compared to 592,500 members at December 31, 2001 and also reflects an increase in the average fees received per member. Administrative services fees for the Government segment increased $88.3 million when comparing 2002 to 2001. The TRICARE Regions 2 and 5 acquisition accounted for $51 million of this increase, with the remainder attributable to the implementation of the TRICARE for Life benefits program effective October 1, 2001. TRICARE for Life is a program for seniors where we provide medical benefit administrative services. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income totaled $86.4 million in 2002, a decrease of $32.4 million from $118.8 million in 2001. Net realized losses of $10.1 million in 2002 compared to net realized gains of $13.9 million in 2001. Net realized losses in 2002 included impairment losses of $27.2 million primarily related to privately held venture capital investment securities after an evaluation indicated that a decline in fair value below the cost basis was other than temporary. Lower interest rates also decreased investment income $10.9 million in 2002 compared to 2001. The average yield on investment securities was 4.6% in 2002, declining from 5.1% in 2001. Medical Expense The medical expense ratio for 2002 was 83.6%, increasing 30 basis points from 83.3% in 2001. The Commercial segment medical expense ratio for 2002 was 83.5%, increasing 40 basis points from 83.1% in 2001. This increase primarily was due to the shift in the mix of our fully insured commercial medical membership to a heavier concentration of larger group sizes. Large group commercial membership represented approximately 65% of our fully insured commercial membership at December 31, 2002 compared to 62% at December 31, 2001. Large group membership traditionally experiences a higher medical expense ratio and a lower selling, general and administrative expense ratio than does our small group membership. The Government segment medical expense ratio for 2002 was 83.8%, increasing 20 basis points from 83.6% in 2001. This increase primarily was attributable to TRICARE. As discussed previously, TRICARE medical expense increased due to expanded benefits for TRICARE beneficiaries mandated by Congress, an increase in eligible beneficiaries, and an increase in the use of Humana’s provider network rather than MTFs. Since these actions were not originally specified in our contracts or were for items that the Department of Defense retains financial risk, we were entitled to equitable revenue adjustments through the change order and BPA processes. These higher medical expenses combined with the associated higher premium revenues resulted in an overall increase in the Government medical expense ratio. SG&A Expense The SG&A expense ratio for 2002 was 15.9%, increasing 60 basis points from 15.3% for 2001. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in severance and related employee benefit expenses of $36.0 million, long-lived asset impairments of $2.4 million, and the establishment of reserves for a contingent contractual provider dispute and other items associated with our 1997 acquisition of Physician Corporation of America, or PCA of $30.1 million. The Commercial segment’s SG&A expense ratio was 18.0% for 2002, increasing 40 basis points from 2001 of 17.6%. This increase was the result of the items discussed above. 40 Table of Contents The Government segment’s SG&A expense ratio was 13.5% for 2002, increasing 70 basis points compared to 12.8% in 2001. This increase resulted from the items discussed above and a change in the mix of revenues. A higher proportion of revenues was generated from administrative services fees, primarily from the TRICARE Regions 2 and 5 acquisition and the implementation of the TRICARE for Life benefit programs effective October 1, 2001. ASO business carries a much higher SG&A ratio than fully insured business. Depreciation and amortization was $120.7 million in 2002, a decrease of $40.8 million, or 25.3%, from $161.5 million in 2001. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we ceased amortizing goodwill on January 1, 2002 in accordance with adopting a new accounting standard. This decreased goodwill amortization by $55 million. On a comparable basis, depreciation and amortization was $106.5 million in 2001, excluding goodwill amortization expense. The $14.2 million increase in 2002 compared to 2001, as adjusted, resulted from capital expenditures primarily related to our technology initiatives and a full year of amortization of other intangible assets related to the acquisition of TRICARE Regions 2 and 5 on May 31, 2001. Interest Expense Interest expense was $17.3 million in 2002, a decrease of $8.0 million from $25.3 million in 2001. This decrease primarily resulted from lower interest rates. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate in 2002 of 32% decreased 4% compared to the 36% effective tax rate in 2001. The lower effective tax rate in 2002 primarily resulted from the cessation of non-deductible goodwill amortization on January 1, 2002, partially offset by higher state income taxes and a lower proportion of tax-exempt investment income to pretax income. In addition, during 2002, the Internal Revenue Service completed their audit of all open years prior to 2000, which resulted in a favorable adjustment to the estimated accrual for income taxes of approximately $32.6 million. This was offset by an increase of approximately $24.5 million in the capital loss valuation allowance after we reevaluated probable capital gain realization in the allowable carryforward period based upon our capital gain experience beginning in 2000 and consideration of alternative tax planning strategies. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete reconciliation to the federal statutory rate. Liquidity Our consolidated liquidity continued to strengthen in 2003, with cash and cash equivalents increasing to $931.4 million at December 31, 2003 from $721.4 million at December 31, 2002. Because we operate as a holding company, our parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. Our parent company liquidity also improved during 2003. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at our parent company amounted to $399.4 million at December 31, 2003, increasing $212.4 million from $187.0 million at December 31, 2002. The primary source for the increase in cash and cash equivalents has been the increase in our net income. The change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 is summarized as follows: 2003 2002 2001 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 413,140 $ 321,408 $ 148,958 Net cash used in investing activities (373,163 ) (128,157 ) (118,807 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 170,070 (123,314 ) (36,293 ) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 210,047 $ 69,937 $ (6,142 ) 41 Table of Contents The primary drivers of operating cash flow in our business are premium collections and medical claim payments. Because premiums generally are collected in advance of claims payments by a period up to several months in many instances, our business should normally produce strong cash flows during a period of increasing enrollment. Conversely, cash flows would be negatively impacted during a period of shrinking enrollment, as was the case for us during 2001. The exception to this general rule is the collection of TRICARE BPAs and change orders, which may occur up to six months after the end of a contract year. Other activities that impact our cash flows are the collection of ASO fees and investment income and the payment of operating expenses, interest expense and taxes. During 2003, our operating cash flows were not substantially impacted by a change in the timing of premium and ASO fee collections or medical claim payments, as both amounts generally increased with inflation and membership growth. However, during 2002, our operating cash flows were negatively impacted by slower cash collections of premium and ASO fee receivables when TRICARE receivables increased by $174 million as detailed in the following table: December 31, Change 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 (in thousands) TRICARE: Base receivable $ 266,656 $ 197,544 $ 166,763 $ 69,112 $ 30,781 Bid price adjustments (BPAs) 92,875 104,044 — (11,169 ) 104,044 Change orders 7,073 57,630 18,423 (50,557 ) 39,207 366,604 359,218 185,186 7,386 174,032 Less: long-term portion of BPAs (38,794 ) (86,471 ) — 47,677 (86,471 ) TRICARE subtotal 327,810 272,747 185,186 55,063 87,561 Commercial and other 178,577 146,882 148,784 31,695 (1,902 ) Allowance for doubtful accounts (40,400 ) (30,178 ) (38,539 ) (10,222 ) 8,361 Total net receivables $ 465,987 $ 389,451 $ 295,431 $ 76,536 $ 94,020 TRICARE base receivables, which are collected monthly in the ordinary course of business, increased in 2003 as rates under our base TRICARE contract increased upon the annual renewal of the contracts for Regions 3 and 4 and Regions 2 and 5. Total TRICARE receivables significantly increased from 2001 to 2002 primarily due to change orders and BPAs due to an increase in activity and deployments surrounding military conflicts in the Middle East. The timing of payments for claims can significantly impact comparisons of our operating cash flows between years. During 2001, operating cash flows were reduced by $132.0 million as a result of our paying down unprocessed claim inventories. Since then, the level of claims inventory has stabilized. The following table presents the estimated valuation and number of unprocessed claims on hand, performance metrics we regularly review. Claims on hand represent the estimated number of provider requests for reimbursement that have been received but not yet processed. EstimatedValuation Claims onHand Number ofDays ClaimsOn-hand (dollars in thousands) December 31, 2000 $ 257,400 1,157,900 11.0 December 31, 2001 $ 125,400 518,100 5.0 December 31, 2002 $ 92,300 424,200 4.5 December 31, 2003 $ 109,700 443,000 4.9 42 Table of Contents Medical and other expenses payable increased during 2003 and 2002 due primarily to medical claims inflation and increases in membership. The timing of claim payments did not significantly impact 2003 or 2002 cash flows from operations. The detail of medical and other expenses payable was as follows at December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001: Change 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 (in thousands) IBNR(1) $ 1,034,858 $ 863,432 $ 802,574 $ 171,426 $ 60,858 Unprocessed claim inventories(2) 109,700 92,300 125,400 17,400 (33,100 ) Processed claim inventories(3) 74,262 105,422 102,622 (31,160 ) 2,800 Payable to pharmacy benefit administrator and other(4) 53,336 80,977 55,790 (27,641 ) 25,187 Total medical and other expenses payable $ 1,272,156 $ 1,142,131 $ 1,086,386 $ 130,025 $ 55,745 (1) IBNR represents an estimate of medical expenses payable for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) at the balance sheet date. The level of IBNR is primarily impacted by membership levels, medical claim trends and the receipt cycle time, which represents the length of time between when a claim is initially incurred and when the claim form is received (i.e. a shorter time span results in a lower IBNR). (2) Unprocessed claim inventories represent the estimated valuation of claims received but not yet fully processed. Further detail regarding unprocessed claim inventories is provided below. (3) Processed claim inventories represent the estimated valuation of processed claims that are in the post claim adjudication process, which consists of administrative functions such as audit and check batching and handling. (4) The balance due to our pharmacy benefit administrator fluctuates due to bi-weekly payments and the month-end cutoff and other medical expenses payable. The timing of Medicare+Choice premium receipts may significantly impact our cash flows from operations in a particular period as the Medicare+Choice premium receipt is payable to us on the first day of each month. When the first day of a month falls on a weekend or holiday, we receive this payment at the end of the previous month. Since this amount is significant, the timing of its receipt can cause a material fluctuation in our operating cash flows from period to period. The Medicare+Choice premium receipts for January 2004 of $211.9 million and for January 2003 of $205.8 million were received early in December 2003 and December 2002, respectively, because January 1 is a holiday. This timing accounts for a significant portion of the unearned revenues balance on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2003 and 2002. Cash Flow from Investing Activities During 2003, we reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows in investment securities, primarily short-duration fixed income securities, totaling $283.1 million. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, we also made capital expenditures as discussed below. Cash Flow from Financing Activities During 2003, we converted our short-term commercial paper debt to long-term borrowings and repurchased common shares as discussed below. The cash used in financing activities in 2002 resulted primarily from common share repurchases while the use of cash in 2001 resulted from reductions in borrowings. Capital Expenditures Our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our technology initiatives and administrative facilities necessary for activities such as claims processing, billing and collections, medical utilization review, and customer service. Total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were $101.3 million in 2003, $112.1 million 43 Table of Contents in 2002, and $115.5 million in 2001. Excluding acquisitions, we expect our total capital expenditures in 2004 to be approximately $100 million, most of which will be used for our technology initiatives and improvement of administrative facilities. Stock Repurchase Plan For the year ended December 31, 2003, we acquired 3.7 million of our common shares at an aggregate cost of $44.1 million, or an average of $12.03 per share. Of these shares, 1.4 million were acquired in connection with employee stock plans at an aggregate cost of $23.3 million, or an average of $16.27 per share, and the remaining 2.3 million shares were acquired in open market transactions at an aggregate cost of $20.8 million, or an average of $9.31 per share. In July 2003, the Board of Directors authorized an additional use of up to $100 million for the repurchase of our common shares exclusive of shares repurchased in connection with employee stock plans. The shares may be purchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. As of February 24, 2004, $94.2 million of the July 2003 authorization remains available for share repurchases. Debt Short-term and long-term debt outstanding was as follows at December 31, 2003 and 2002: 2003 2002 (in thousands) Short-term debt: Conduit commercial paper financing program $ — $ 265,000 Long-term debt: 6.30% senior, unsecured notes due 2018, net of unamortized discount of $838 at December 31, 2003 $ 299,162 $ — 7.25% senior, unsecured notes due 2006, net of unamortized discount of $376 at December 31, 2003 and $521 at December 31, 2002 299,624 299,479 Fair value of interest rate swap agreements 12,754 34,889 Deferred gain from interest rate swap exchange 26,175 — Total senior notes 637,715 334,368 Other long-term borrowings 4,923 5,545 Total long-term debt $ 642,638 $ 339,913 Senior Notes In order to term-out our short-term debt and take advantage of historically low interest rates, we issued $300 million 6.30% senior notes due August 1, 2018 on August 5, 2003. Our net proceeds, reduced for the cost of the offering, were approximately $295.8 million. The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of our short term cash needs. In order to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of our $300 million 6.30% senior notes and our $300 million 7.25% senior notes attributable to fluctuations in interest rates, we entered into interest rate swap agreements. Interest rate swap agreements, which are considered derivatives, are contracts that exchange interest payments on a specified principal amount, or notional amount, for a specified period. The interest rate swap agreements have the same critical terms as our 6.30% senior notes and our 7.25% senior notes. Changes in the fair value of the 6.30% or 7.25% senior notes and the swap agreements due to changing interest rates are assumed to offset each other completely, resulting in no impact to earnings from hedge ineffectiveness. Our swap agreements are recognized in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with an equal and offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of our senior notes. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements are estimated based 44 Table of Contents on quoted market prices of comparable agreements, and reflect the amounts we would receive (or pay) to terminate the agreements at the reporting date. Our interest rate swap agreements exchange the fixed interest rate under our 6.30% and 7.25% senior notes for a variable interest rate. At December 31, 2003, the variable interest rate was 2.03% for the 6.30% senior notes and 6.26% for the 7.25% senior notes. The $300 million swap agreements for the 6.30% senior notes mature on August 1, 2018, and the $300 million swap agreements for the 7.25% senior notes mature on August 1, 2006, and each has the same critical terms as the related senior notes. In June 2003, we recorded a deferred gain and received proceeds of $31.6 million in exchange for new swap agreements discussed above related to our 7.25% senior notes. The corresponding deferred swap gain of $31.6 million is being amortized to reduce interest expense over the remaining term of the 7.25% senior notes. The carrying value of our 7.25% senior notes has been increased $26.2 million by the remaining deferred swap gain balance at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2003, the $12.8 million fair value of our swap agreements is included in other long-term assets. Likewise, the carrying value of our senior notes has been increased $12.8 million to reflect its fair value. The counterparties to our swap agreements are major financial institutions with which we also have other financial relationships. Credit Agreements We maintain two unsecured revolving credit agreements consisting of a $265 million, 4-year revolving credit agreement and a $265 million, 364-day revolving credit agreement with a one-year term-out option. A one-year term-out option converts the outstanding borrowings, if any, under the credit agreement to a one-year term loan upon expiration. The 4-year revolving credit agreement expires in October 2005. In October 2003, we renewed the 364-day revolving credit agreement which expires in October 2004, unless extended. There were no balances outstanding under either agreement at December 31, 2003 or 2002. Under these agreements, at our option, we can borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis. The revolving credit portion of both agreements bears interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on LIBOR plus a spread. The spread, which varies depending on our credit ratings, ranges from 80 to 125 basis points for our 4-year agreement, and 85 to 137.5 basis points for our 364-day agreement. We also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization. This facility fee, currently 25 basis points, may fluctuate between 15 and 50 basis points, depending upon our credit ratings. The competitive advance portion of any borrowings under either credit agreement will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate basis, at our option. These credit agreements, and the agreement relating to the conduit commercial paper program described below, contain customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default, including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of net worth, minimum interest coverage, and maximum leverage ratios. At December 31, 2003, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenant requirements. The terms of each of these credit agreements also include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing, including a customary material adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to borrow. We have not experienced a material adverse effect and we know of no circumstances or events which would be reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect. We do not believe the material adverse effect clause poses a material funding risk to Humana in the future. Commercial Paper Programs We maintain indirect access to the commercial paper market through our conduit commercial paper financing program. Under this program, a third party issues commercial paper and loans the proceeds of those issuances to us so that the interest and principal payments on the loans match those on the underlying commercial 45 Table of Contents paper. The $265 million, 364-day revolving credit agreement supports the conduit commercial paper financing program of up to $265 million. We also maintain and may issue short-term debt securities under a commercial paper program when market conditions allow. The program is backed by our credit agreements described above. Under the terms of our credit agreements, aggregate borrowings under both the credit agreements and commercial paper program cannot exceed $530 million. At December 31, 2003, we had no direct or indirect (conduit) commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Other Borrowings Other borrowings of $4.9 million at December 31, 2003 and $5.5 million at December 31, 2002 represent financing for the renovation of a building, bear interest at 2% per annum, are collateralized by the building, and are payable in various installments through 2014. Shelf Registration On April 1, 2003, our universal shelf registration became effective with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This allows us to register debt or equity securities, from time to time, with the amount, price and terms to be determined at the time of the sale. After the issuance of our $300 million, 6.30% senior notes in August 2003, we have up to $300 million remaining from a total of $600 million under the universal shelf registration. The universal shelf registration allows us to use the net proceeds from any future sales of our securities for our operations and for other general corporate purposes, including repayment or refinancing of borrowings, working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, or the repurchase of our outstanding securities. Contractual Obligations We are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to December 31, 2003 as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1–3 Years 3–5 Years More than5 Years (in thousands) Debt(1) $ 642,638 $ 635 $ 327,163 $ 1,080 $ 313,760 Operating leases(2) 257,222 63,392 93,070 54,969 45,791 Purchase and other obligations(3) 48,983 24,344 18,235 4,651 1,753 Total $ 948,843 $ 88,371 $ 438,468 $ 60,700 $ 361,304 (1) Debt payments could be accelerated upon violation of debt covenants. We believe the likelihood of a debt covenant violation is remote. (2) We lease facilities, computer hardware, and other equipment under long-term operating leases that are noncancelable and expire on various dates through 2017. We sublease facilities or partial facilities to third party tenants for space not used in our operations which partially mitigates our operating lease commitments. An operating lease is a type of off-balance sheet arrangement. Assuming we acquired the asset, rather than leased, we would have recognized a liability for the financing of these assets. See also Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. (3) Purchase and other obligations include agreements to purchase services, primarily information technology related services, or to make improvements to real estate that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum levels of service to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the appropriate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. 46 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our 5-year and 7-year airplane operating leases provide for a residual value payment of no more than $9.2 million at the end of the lease terms, which expire December 29, 2004 for the 5-year lease and January 1, 2010 for the 7-year lease. We have the right to exercise a purchase option with respect to the leased airplanes or the airplanes can be sold to a third party. If we decide not to exercise our purchase option at the end of the lease, we must pay the lessor a maximum amount of $4.4 million related to the 5-year lease and $4.8 million related to the 7-year lease. The amount will be reduced by the net sales proceeds of the airplanes to a third party. After considering the current fair value of the airplanes, we recorded a $1.5 million provision during 2003 for the exposure from the residual value guarantee. During 2003, we terminated two 5-year airplane leases early. The impact of these transactions was not material. Indemnifications and Guarantees Through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities, certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by Humana Inc., our parent company, in the event of insolvency for (1), member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency; (2), benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged; and (3), payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency. Our parent also has guaranteed the obligations of our TRICARE subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us, or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial. Other Liquidity Factors Our investment-grade credit rating at December 31, 2003 was Baa3 according to Moody’s Investors Services, Inc., or Moody’s, and BBB, according to Standard & Poor’s Corporation, or S&P. A downgrade to Ba2 or lower by Moody’s and BB or lower by S&P would give the counterparties of three of our interest rate swap agreements with a $300 million notional amount, the right, but not the obligation, to cancel the interest rate swap agreement. If cancelled, we would pay or receive an amount based on the fair market value of the swap agreement. Assuming these swap agreements had been cancelled on December 31, 2003, we would have received $8.7 million. Other than the swap agreements, adverse changes in our credit ratings will not create, increase, or accelerate any liabilities. Adverse changes in our credit rating will increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future. Related Parties No related party transactions had a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Certain immaterial related party transactions are discussed in our Proxy Statement for the meeting to be held April 22, 2004—see “Certain Transactions with Management and Others.” Regulatory Requirements Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans, or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., our parent company, require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required. 47 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2003, we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $1,086.5 million in our state regulated health insurance subsidiaries. Each of these subsidiaries was in compliance with applicable statutory requirements which aggregated $640.4 million. Although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume, product mix, and the quality of assets held, minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level. Certain states rely on risk-based capital requirements, or RBC, to define the required levels of equity. RBC is a model developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to monitor an entity’s solvency. This calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels. If RBC were adopted by all states at December 31, 2003, each of our subsidiaries would be in compliance and we would have $381.9 million of aggregate capital and surplus above any of the levels that require corrective action under RBC. One TRICARE subsidiary under the Regions 3 and 4 contract with the Department of Defense is required to maintain current assets at least equivalent to its current liabilities. We were in compliance with this requirement at December 31, 2003. Future Liquidity Needs Because of the items discussed in this Liquidity section, we believe that funds from future operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreements and commercial paper program are sufficient to meet short and intermediate-term liquidity needs. We also believe these sources of funds are adequate to allow us to fund selected expansion opportunities, as well as to fund capital requirements. Market Risk-Sensitive Financial Instruments and Positions The level of our pretax earnings is subject to risk due to changes in investment income from our fixed income portfolio which is partially offset by both our debt position and the short-term duration of the fixed income investment portfolio. We evaluated the impact on our investment income and debt expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100, 200 and 300 basis points over the next twelve-month period, as reflected in the following table. The modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change in pretax earnings considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt, which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelve-month period. This evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may effect interest income, including, among others, unexpected changes of cash flow into and out of the portfolio, shifts in the asset mix between tax and tax-exempt securities, and spread changes specific to various investment categories. In the past ten years, changes in 3 month LIBOR rates during the year have exceeded 300 basis points twice, have not changed between 200 and 300 basis points, have changed between 100 and 200 basis points once and have changed by less than 100 basis points seven times. LIBOR was 1.15% at December 31, 2003. Our model assumed the maximum possible reduction in LIBOR could not exceed 115 basis points.

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, or DIMA, was signed into law. DIMA includes provisions that require the 2004 stabilization funding to be directed toward increased reimbursement for providers, increased benefits or access for members, or decreased member premiums. We believe DIMA will open new opportunities for us. However, we do not believe that the benefit to our 2004 financial position, results of operations, or cash flows will be material. Our current TRICARE contract with the Department of Defense will be in effect until April 30, 2004 for Regions 2 and 5 and until June 30, 2004 for Regions 3 and 4. Each of the contracts is subject to a one-year renewal at the Government’s option. We believe these contracts will continue until the TRICARE transition described below. On August 21, 2003, the Department of Defense notified us that we were awarded the contract for the South Region, one of three newly-created regions under the government’s revised TRICARE Program. The current TRICARE Regions 3 and 4 will become part of the new South Region along with Region 6, which is currently administered by another contractor. The current Regions 2 and 5 will become part of the North Region, which was awarded to another contractor. Pursuant to the Department of Defense’s bid process, each of the three awards was subject to protests by unsuccessful bidders of prime contracts, however, none of the protests were successful. Under the Department of Defense’s current schedule for implementation of the new TRICARE contracts, Regions 2 and 5 will transition to the new North Region for the start of healthcare delivery on July 1, 2004. Regions 3 and 4 will become part of the new South Region for the start of healthcare delivery on August 1, 2004 and Region 6 will become part of our new South Region for the start of healthcare delivery on November 1, 2004. If this schedule is realized, our TRICARE membership is expected to temporarily decline to 1.5 million in July 2004, and is expected to increase to 2.8 million in November 2004. This will also result in a decline in revenues during this period. In addition, retail pharmacy benefits for TRICARE beneficiaries will be administered separately under the new Department of Defense TRICARE Retail Pharmacy Program. On September 26, 2003, we were notified that we were not awarded the retail pharmacy contract and, later, that our protest of this award decision was not upheld. We currently have Medicaid contracts with the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration through June 30, 2005, subject to each party agreeing upon annual rates. In July 2003, we signed amendments to the Puerto Rico Medicaid contracts regarding a premium rate increase for the annual period ending June 30, 2004. Our other Medicaid contracts are in Florida and Illinois, and are annual contracts. As of December 31, 2003, Puerto Rico accounted for approximately 84% of our total Medicaid membership. Other than as described herein, the loss of any of our existing or pending government contracts or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action, including reductions in premium payments to us, or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Legal Proceedings We are party to a variety of legal actions in the ordinary course of business, including employment matters, breach of contract actions, tort claims, and shareholder suits involving alleged securities fraud. A description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under “Legal Proceedings” of Item 3 in 49 Table of Contents Part 1. We cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty, and we are incurring expenses in defense of these matters. In addition, recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. Therefore, these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Cautionary Statements This document includes both historical and forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are made within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and we are including this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events, trends and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, among other things, the information discussed below. In making these statements, we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results. Our business is highly complicated, regulated and competitive with many different factors affecting results. If the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members, or if our estimates of medical claim reserves based upon our estimates of future medical claims are inadequate, our profitability could decline. We use a significant portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members. These costs include claims payments, capitation payments, allocations of some centralized expenses and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members. These costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members. Generally, premiums in the health care business are fixed for one-year periods. Accordingly, costs we incur in excess of our medical cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums. We estimate the costs of our future medical claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns, medical inflation, historical developments, including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns, and other relevant factors. We also record medical claims reserves for future payments. We continually review estimates of future payments relating to medical claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves. However, increases in the use or cost of services by our members, competition, government regulations and many other factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums. These factors may include: • increased use of medical facilities and services, including prescription drugs; • increased cost of such services; • the Company’s membership mix; • termination of capitation arrangements resulting in the transfer of membership to fee-for-service arrangements; • changes or reductions of our utilization management functions such as preauthorization of services, concurrent review or requirements for physician referrals; • catastrophes, including acts of terrorism or epidemics; • the introduction of new or costly treatments, including new technologies; 50 Table of Contents • medical cost inflation; and • new government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes. Failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient medical claim reserves may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. If we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, our membership and profitability could decline. We are in a highly competitive industry. Many of our competitors are more established in the health care industry and have a larger market share and greater financial resources than we do in some markets. In addition, other companies may enter our markets in the future, including emerging competitors in the MedicareAdvantage program, in e-commerce insurance or benefit programs and in consumer-directed health plans. Contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually. While health plans compete on the basis of many factors, including service and the quality and depth of provider networks, we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition. In addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs, we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices. Premium increases, introduction of new product designs, and our relationship with our providers in various markets, among other issues, could affect our membership levels. Other actions that could affect membership levels include the possible exit of or entrance to MedicareAdvantage or Commercial markets. If we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share, if membership does not increase as we expect, or if it declines, or if we lose accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our future performance depends in large part upon our management team’s ability to execute our strategy to position the company for the future. This strategy includes the growth of our Commercial segment business, introduction of new products and benefit designs, including our Smart products, the successful implementation of our e-business initiatives and the selection and adoption of new technologies. We believe that the adoption of new technologies will contribute toward a reduction in administrative costs as we more closely align our workforce with our membership. This alignment is achieved through reductions in workforce or by employing additional people in certain strategic operating areas such as sales and underwriting. Additionally, we have consolidated our service centers and their related systems as part of our operational initiatives. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to position the company for future growth. Failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. If we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data, or to strategically implement new information systems, or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business. Our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs. Our ability to adequately price our products and services, provide effective and efficient service to our customers, and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems. As a result of our past and on-going acquisition activities, we have acquired additional systems. We have been taking steps to 51 Table of Contents reduce the number of systems we operate, have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities, and are gradually migrating existing business to fewer systems. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity, we could have operational disruptions, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes, have regulatory problems, have increases in operating expenses, lose existing customers, have difficulty in attracting new customers, or suffer other adverse consequences. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences. We depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systems-related support, equipment, facilities, and certain data, including data center operations, data network, voice communication services and pharmacy data processing. This dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to perform adequately under the contract, due to internal or external factors. Due to continued consolidation in the industry, there are a limited number of service organizations with the size, scale and capabilities to effectively provide certain of these services, especially with regard to pharmacy benefits processing and management. However, we believe that other organizations could provide similar services on comparable terms. A change in service providers, however, could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which could adversely affect our operating results. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry. We expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows. There can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems, developing new systems to support our operations, integrating new systems, protecting our proprietary information, and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future. Failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial positions, results of operations and cash flows. If we fail to manage prescription drug costs successfully, our financial results could suffer. In general, prescription drug costs have been rising over the past few years. These increases are due to the introduction of new drugs costing significantly more than existing drugs, direct to consumer advertising by the pharmaceutical industry that creates consumer demand for particular brand-name drugs, and members seeking medications to address lifestyle changes. In order to control prescription drug costs, we have implemented multi-tiered copayment benefit designs for prescription drugs, including our four-tiered copayment benefit design, Rx4 and an Rx allowance program. We are also evaluating other multi-tiered designs. We cannot assure that these efforts will be successful in controlling costs. Failure to control these costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We are involved in various legal actions, which, if resolved unfavorably to us, could result in substantial monetary damages. We are a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business, including employment and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, and tort claims. We, together with some of our competitors in the health benefits business are defendants in a number of purported class action lawsuits. These include an action against us and nine of our competitors that purports to 52 Table of Contents be brought on behalf of health care providers. This suit alleges breaches of federal statutes, including ERISA and RICO. In addition, because of the nature of the health care business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations, including the design, management and offering of products and services. These include and could include in the future: • claims relating to the methodologies for calculating premiums; • claims relating to the denial of health care benefits; • challenges to the use of some software products used in administering claims; • medical malpractice actions based on our medical necessity decisions or brought against us on the theory that we are liable for our providers’ alleged malpractice; • allegations of anti-competitive and unfair business activities; • provider disputes over compensation and termination of provider contracts; • disputes related to self-funded business, including actions alleging claim administration errors; • claims related to the failure to disclose some business practices; and • claims relating to customer audits and contract performance. In some cases, substantial non-economic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal False Claims Act, RICO and other statutes may be sought. While we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities, other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded. Additionally, the cost of business insurance coverage has increased significantly. As a result, we have increased the amount of risk that we self-insure, particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business. We believe that we are adequately insured for claims in excess of our self-insurance. However, some types of damages, like punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance, particularly in those jurisdictions in which coverage of punitive damages is prohibited. Insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future. A description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under “Legal Proceedings” of Item 3 in Part I. We cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty, and we are incurring expenses in the defense of these matters. In addition, recent court decisions, including some that erode protections under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. Therefore, these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. As a government contractor, we are exposed to additional risks that could adversely affect our business or our willingness to participate in government health care programs. A significant portion of our revenues relates to federal, state and local government health care coverage programs, including the TRICARE, Medicare+Choice, and Medicaid programs. These programs involve various risks, including: • the possibility of reduced or insufficient government reimbursement in the future; • the possibility that we will not be able to extend or renew any of the contracts relating to these programs. These contracts also are generally subject to frequent change, including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll, reduce the revenue we receive or increase 53 Table of Contents our administrative or health care costs under those programs. Our current TRICARE contract with the Department of Defense will be in effect until April 30, 2004 for Regions 2 and 5 and until June 30, 2004 for Regions 3 and 4. Each of the contracts is subject to a one-year renewal at the Government’s option. We believe these contracts will continue until the TRICARE transition described below. On August 21, 2003, the Department of Defense notified us that we were awarded the contract for the South Region, one of three newly-created regions under the government’s revised TRICARE Program. The current TRICARE Regions 3 and 4 will become part of the new South Region along with Region 6, which is currently administered by another contractor. The current Regions 2 and 5 will become part of the North Region, which was awarded to another contractor. Pursuant to the Department of Defense’s bid process, each of the three awards was subject to protests by unsuccessful bidders of prime contracts, however, none of the protests were successful. • under the Department of Defense’s current schedule for implementation of the new TRICARE contracts, Regions 2 and 5 will transition to the new North Region for the start of healthcare delivery on July 1, 2004. Regions 3 and 4 will become part of the new South Region for the start of healthcare delivery on August 1, 2004 and Region 6 will become part of our new South Region for the start of healthcare delivery on November 1, 2004. If this schedule is realized, our TRICARE membership is expected to temporarily decline to 1.5 million in July 2004, and is expected to increase to 2.8 million in November 2004. This will also result in a decline in revenues during this period. • in the event government reimbursement were to decline from projected amounts, our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business. Changes to these government programs in the future may also affect our ability or willingness to participate in these programs. Other than as described herein, the loss of our current or future TRICARE contracts, would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows; • at December 31, 2003, under one of our contracts with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 229,100 members in Florida. This contract accounted for approximately 15% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The loss of this and other CMS contracts or significant changes in the MedicareAdvantage program as a result of legislative action, including reductions in payments to us or increases in benefits to members without corresponding increases in payments, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; • in December 2003, The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act, or DIMA, was signed into law. DIMA includes provisions that require the 2004 stabilization funding to be directed toward increased reimbursement for providers, increased benefits or access for members or decreased member premiums. We believe DIMA will open new opportunities for us. However, DIMA may intensify competition in the seniors’ health services market. We do not believe that the benefit to our 2004 financial position, results of operations or cash flows will be material; • higher comparative medical costs; • government regulatory and reporting requirements; • higher marketing and advertising costs per member as a result of marketing to individuals as opposed to groups; and • the possibility of temporary or permanent suspension from participating in government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, if we are convicted of fraud or other criminal conduct in the performance of a health care program or if there is an adverse decision against us under the federal False Claims Act. 54 Table of Contents Our industry is currently subject to substantial government regulation, which, along with possible increased governmental regulation or legislative reform, increases our costs of doing business and could adversely affect our profitability. The health care industry in general, and health insurance, particularly health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, and preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation, including: • regulation relating to minimum net worth; • licensing requirements; • approval of policy language and benefits; • mandated benefits and processes; • provider compensation arrangements; • member disclosure; • approval of acquisitions; • approval of entry, withdrawal or re-entry into a state or market; • premium rates; and • periodic examinations by state and federal agencies. State regulations require our licensed, operating subsidiaries to maintain minimum net worth requirements and restrict some investment activities. Additionally, those regulations restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividend payments, loans, loan repayments or other payments to us. In recent years, significant federal and state legislation affecting our business has been enacted. State and federal governmental authorities are continually considering changes to laws and regulations applicable to us and are currently considering regulations relating to: • mandatory benefits and products; • rules tightening time periods in which claims must be paid; • medical malpractice reform; • defining medical necessity; • health insurance access; • provider compensation and contract language; • disclosure of provider fee schedules and other data impacting payments to providers; • product flexibility and use of innovative technology; • disclosure of provider quality information; • health plan liability to members who fail to receive appropriate care; • disclosure and composition of physician networks; • formation of regional/national association health plans for small employers; • physicians’ ability to collectively negotiate contract terms with carriers, including fees; and • mental health parity. All of these proposals could apply to us. 55 Table of Contents There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses or that legislative or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals could adversely affect our revenue or the number of our members, increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, has adopted risk-based capital requirements, also known as RBC, which is subject to state-by-state adoption and to the extent implemented, sets minimum capitalization requirements for insurance and HMO companies. The NAIC recommendations for life insurance companies were adopted in all states and the prescribed calculation for HMOs has been adopted in most states in which we operate. The HMO rules may increase the minimum capital required for some of our subsidiaries. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions, establishing uniform health care provider, payer, and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data. Under the new HIPAA standard transactions and code sets rules, we have made significant systems enhancements and invest in new technological solutions. The compliance and enforcement date for standard transactions and code sets rules was October 16, 2003. We have continued to be in compliance with this regulation. However, as many providers indicated that they could not yet comply, CMS stated that covered entities making a good faith effort to comply with HIPAA transactions and code-set standards would be allowed to implement contingency plans to maintain their operations and cash flows. On October 15, 2003, we announced implementation of a contingency plan to accept non-compliant electronic transactions from our providers. We will continue to accept and process transactions sent in pre-HIPAA electronic formats from providers who are showing a good-faith effort until all providers and clearinghouses are capable of transmitting fully compliant standards transactions as defined in the HIPAA implementation guidelines or until CMS begins enforcement of the HIPAA Electronic Data Interchange regulations. Management believes that the implementation of our contingency plans has minimized any disruptions in our business operations during this transition. However, if entities with which we do business do not ultimately comply with the HIPAA transactions and code set standards, it could result in disruptions of certain of our business operations. Additionally, under the new HIPAA privacy rules, which became effective on April 14, 2003, we must now comply with a variety of requirements concerning the use and disclosure of individuals’ protected health information, establish rigorous internal procedures to protect health information and enter into business associate contracts with those companies to whom protected health information is disclosed. Regulations issued in February 2003 set standards for the security of electronic health information requiring compliance by April 21, 2005. Violations of these rules will subject us to significant penalties. Compliance with HIPAA regulations requires significant systems enhancements, training and administrative effort. The final rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws, but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent. HIPAA could also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates. Another area receiving increased focus is the time in which various laws require the payment of health care claims. Many states already have legislation in place covering payment of claims within a specific number of days. However, due to provider groups advocating for laws or regulations establishing even stricter standards, procedures and penalties, we expect additional regulatory scrutiny and supplemental legislation with respect to claims payment practices. The provider-sponsored bills are characterized by stiff penalties for late payment, including high interest rates payable to providers and costly fines levied by state insurance departments and attorneys general. This legislation and possible future regulation and oversight could expose our Company to additional liability and penalties. We are also subject to various governmental audits and investigations. These can include audits and investigations by state attorneys general, CMS, the Office of the Inspector General of Health and Human 56 Table of Contents Services, the Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, and state Departments of Insurance and Departments of Health. These activities could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in various programs, or the imposition of fines, penalties and other sanctions. In addition, disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services. If we fail to maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members, our business could be adversely affected. We contract with physicians, hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members. Our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers. These providers may share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a cost-effective manner. In any particular market, providers could refuse to contract with us, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us, less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, some providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions and negotiating power. In addition, physician or practice management companies, which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage, may, in some cases, compete directly with us. If these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected. In some situations, we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care physicians for an actuarially determined, fixed, per-member-per-month fee under which physicians are paid an amount to provide all required medical services to our members (i.e. capitation). The inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us. In addition, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. The financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us, even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider. There can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. Our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted. Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of Humana Inc., the parent company. These subsidiaries generally are regulated by states’ Departments of Insurance. In most states, we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts, or, in some states, any amount. In addition, we normally notify the state Departments of Insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval. We are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. One TRICARE subsidiary under the Regions 3 and 4 contract with the Department of Defense is required to maintain assets at least equivalent to its current liabilities. 57 Table of Contents Increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business. The health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry. This publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation, including some large jury awards, legislative activity, regulation and governmental review of industry practices. These factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services, may require us to change our products or services, may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines. Any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. ITEM 7a.

In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the forward–looking events discussed in this document might not occur. There may also be other risks that we are unable to predict at this time. Any of these risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward–looking statements. Overview Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, Humana Inc. is one of the nation’s largest publicly traded health benefits companies, based on our 2004 revenues of $13.1 billion. We offer coordinated health insurance coverage and related services through a variety of traditional and Internet-based plans for employer groups, government-sponsored programs, and individuals. As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately 7.0 million members in our medical insurance programs, as well as approximately 1.7 million members in our specialty products programs. During 2004, 43% of our premiums and administrative services fees were derived from contracts with the federal government, including 17% related to our TRICARE contracts and 15% related to one contract in Florida with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS. Additionally, 37% of our premiums and administrative services fees in 2004 were earned from contracts with employer groups and individuals covering members located in Texas, Illinois, Florida, Kentucky and Ohio. We manage our business with two segments: Commercial and Government. The Commercial segment consists of members enrolled in products marketed to employer groups and individuals, and includes three lines of business: fully insured medical, administrative services only, or ASO, and specialty. The Government segment consists of members enrolled in government-sponsored programs, and includes three lines of business: Medicare Advantage, TRICARE, and Medicaid. We identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information which is consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer in managing our business. The segment information aggregates products with similar economic characteristics. These characteristics include the nature of customer groups and pricing, benefits and underwriting requirements. The results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes. We allocate all selling, general and administrative expenses, investment and other income, interest expense, and goodwill, but no other assets or liabilities, to our segments. Members served by our two segments often utilize the same medical provider networks, enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share overhead costs and assets. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. We are somewhat unique in our industry by having revenues and enrollment approximately split between Commercial and Government segments, drawing revenues from group, individual, Medicare, Medicaid and military business lines. We believe that it is difficult to time market cycles and external influences on various parts of our businesses. By remaining committed to varied lines of business with a long-term view, we may benefit through short-term market cycles. We believe our diversification across segments and products allows us to increase our chances of success. 24 Table of Contents Our results are impacted by many factors, but most notably are influenced by our ability to establish and maintain a competitive and efficient cost structure and to accurately and consistently establish competitive premium, ASO fee, and plan benefit levels that are commensurate with our medical and administrative costs. Medical costs are subject to a high rate of inflation due to many forces, including new technologies and medical procedures, increasing capacity and supply of medical services, new prescription drugs and therapies, an aging population, the tort liability system, and government regulations. Our strategy to drive Commercial segment profitability focuses on providing solutions for employers to the rising cost of health care through the use of a variety of innovative and consumer-directed product designs. These products are supported by electronic informational capabilities, including education, tools, and technologies provided primarily through the Internet. To that end, we have developed an innovative suite of products styled as “Smart” products. We believe that these Smart products offer the best solution for many employers to the problem of quickly rising health care costs for their employees. Membership in our Smart products and other consumer-directed health plans exceeded 280,000 members at December 31, 2004, more than doubling from a year ago. We believe that growth in these products, which are offered both on a fully-insured and ASO basis and may ultimately be competitively priced to produce higher margins, is a key component, among other items, for further improvement in the results of our Commercial segment. Additionally, we have increased the diversification of our commercial membership base, not only through our consumer-choice products, but also by (1) expanding our ASO membership to take advantage of our network discounts in the mid-market group segment and (2) launching our HumanaOne individual product to address an increasing migration of insureds from small group. While we expect our Smart products to become a driver of growth in the years ahead as health care inflation persists, we are enhancing the traditional products which comprise the bulk of our commercial portfolio today by applying our consumer-choice innovation. Other important factors which impact our Commercial segment profitability are both the competitive pricing environment and market conditions. With respect to pricing, there is a tradeoff between sustaining or increasing underwriting margins versus increasing or decreasing enrollment. We have experienced a decline in our membership in the 2 to 300 life group size as a result of pricing actions by some competitors who we perceive as desiring to gain market share in certain markets. With respect to market conditions, we are impacted by economies of scale on administrative overhead. As a result of a decline in preference for tightly-managed HMO products, medical costs have become increasingly comparable among the larger competitors. Product design and consumer involvement have become more important drivers of medical services consumption, and administrative expense efficiency is becoming a more significant driver of commercial margin sustainability. Consequently, we continually evaluate our administrative expense structure and realize administrative expense savings through productivity gains. Additionally, because our Commercial segment shares overhead costs with our Government segment, an increase or decrease in the size of our Government operations impacts our Commercial segment profitability. In our Government segment, after being awarded the South Region contract in 2003, we transitioned our TRICARE business to one of three newly-created regions under the government’s revised TRICARE program. On July 1, 2004, our Regions 2 and 5 contract servicing approximately 1.1 million TRICARE members became part of a new North Region, which was awarded to another contractor. On August 1, 2004, our Regions 3 and 4 contract became part of our new South Region contract. On November 1, 2004, the Region 6 contract, previously administered by the same contractor, with approximately 1 million members, became part of the South Region contract. The members added with the Region 6 contract essentially offset the members lost four months earlier with the Regions 2 and 5 contract. With the transition complete, we look forward to a more stable level of TRICARE membership in 2005 and the start of the second option year under the South contract on April 1, 2005. As more fully discussed on page 45, TRICARE revenues consist of an underwriting fee, healthcare services provided to beneficiaries which, in turn, are reimbursed, and administrative services fees primarily related to claim processing and customer service. In our Medicare business, the passage of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, or MMA, in December 2003 demonstrated the federal government’s commitment to providing health 25 Table of Contents benefits and options to seniors and has started the resurgence of Medicare as a business line that should bring us accelerating growth in 2005 and 2006. We already have established Medicare Private Fee-For-Service plans in eleven new states, and recently have received approvals from CMS establishing Local Medicare PPO plans in many of our existing markets where we have established competitive networks. Medicare Private Fee-For-Service plans generally offer additional benefits compared to traditional Medicare in exchange for a monthly premium paid by the member. These plans typically include a prescription drug benefit with no provider network restrictions. Local Medicare PPO plans typically will offer an even higher level of benefits to members, including a prescription drug benefit and a lower level of member cost-sharing on many benefits while seeking medical services from in-network providers. These products are more fully-described beginning on page 6. We continue to evaluate additional states and local markets where we believe we can be competitive with these products and anticipate further expansion during 2005. Accordingly, we anticipate an organic increase in our Medicare Advantage enrollment of 10% to 15% during 2005. Including the February 2005 acquisition of CarePlus Health Plans of Florida, as more fully described below, we anticipate having approximately 470,000 to 485,000 Medicare Advantage members at December 31, 2005. Although still under evaluation, we believe we are well-positioned to participate in Medicare Regional PPO plans and the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan, as established by the MMA, beginning in 2006. In connection herewith, we have notified CMS of our intent to bid on these programs. As a long-time successful participant in the Medicare program, we believe that we possess (1) the business competencies and management experience with senior product design, (2) a robust and scalable multi-channel distribution system, (3) an established and competitive network including a national retail pharmacy network, and (4) an established brand awareness with seniors; all of which will enable us to compete for market share in this expanding business line over the next several years. Other highlights include the following: • On April 1, 2004, we acquired Ochsner Health Plan for $157.1 million in cash, establishing a new market in New Orleans, Louisiana for our Commercial and Medicare lines of business and on February 16, 2005, we acquired CarePlus Health Plans of Florida, increasing our Medicare presence in South Florida. These transactions are more fully-described below and in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. • Diluted earnings per share of $1.72 for 2004, an increase of 22.0% from $1.41 per share in 2003. • The Government segment pretax earnings for 2004 of $273.8 million increased $50.1 million, or 22.4%, from $223.7 million during 2003. The Commercial segment pretax earnings of $142.0 million in 2004 were 17.4% higher compared to pretax earnings of $121.0 million in 2003. • Consolidated revenues for 2004 of $13.1 billion increased 7.2% from $12.2 billion for 2003 resulting from the Ochsner acquisition and an increase in per member premiums. • The consolidated medical expense ratio in 2004 of 84.1% increased from 83.5% in 2003 while the consolidated SG&A expense ratio of 14.5% in 2004 declined from 15.4% in 2003. • Cash flows from operations of $347.8 million in 2004 decreased from $413.1 million in the prior year primarily due to the timing of Medicare Advantage premium remittances more fully discussed in the liquidity section on page 35. • During 2004, we repurchased 3.8 million common shares for $67.0 million at an average price of $17.83 per share. We intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain critical accounting principles and estimates impact our financial statements. Recent Acquisitions On February 16, 2005, we acquired CarePlus Health Plans of Florida, or CarePlus, as well as its affiliated 10 medical centers and pharmacy company for approximately $450 million in cash including the acquisition of 26 Table of Contents approximately $32 million of statutory capital and surplus in excess of the minimum statutory requirements. CarePlus provides Medicare Advantage HMO plans and benefits to approximately 50,000 Medicare eligible beneficiaries in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. This acquisition enhances our Medicare market position in South Florida. We financed the transaction with $156 million of cash on hand and $294 million of borrowings under our credit agreement. The purchase price is subject to a balance sheet settlement process with a nine month claims run-out period. On April 1, 2004, we acquired Ochsner Health Plan, or Ochsner, from the Ochsner Clinic Foundation for $157.1 million in cash. Ochsner, a Louisiana health plan, added approximately 152,600 commercial medical members, primarily in fully insured large group accounts, and approximately 33,100 members in the Medicare Advantage program. This acquisition enabled us to enter a new market with significant market share which should facilitate new sales opportunities in this and surrounding markets, including Houston, Texas. These transactions are more fully described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. 27 Table of Contents Comparison of Results of Operations for 2004 and 2003 Certain financial data for our two segments was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003: Change 2004 2003 Dollars Percentage (in thousands, except ratios) Premium revenues: Fully insured $ 6,614,482 $ 6,240,806 $ 373,676 6.0 % Specialty 349,564 320,206 29,358 9.2 % Total Commercial 6,964,046 6,561,012 403,034 6.1 % Medicare Advantage 3,086,598 2,527,446 559,152 22.1 % TRICARE 2,127,595 2,249,725 (122,130 ) (5.4 )% Medicaid 511,193 487,100 24,093 4.9 % Total Government 5,725,386 5,264,271 461,115 8.8 % Total $ 12,689,432 $ 11,825,283 $ 864,149 7.3 % Administrative services fees: Commercial $ 166,032 $ 122,846 $ 43,186 35.2 % Government 106,764 148,830 (42,066 ) (28.3 )% Total $ 272,796 $ 271,676 $ 1,120 0.4 % Income before income taxes: Commercial $ 142,010 $ 121,010 $ 21,000 17.4 % Government 273,840 223,706 50,134 22.4 % Total $ 415,850 $ 344,716 $ 71,134 20.6 % Medical expense ratios (a): Commercial 83.9 % 82.9 % 1.0 Government 84.3 % 84.3 % — Total 84.1 % 83.5 % 0.6 SG&A expense ratios (b): Commercial 16.4 % 16.9 % (0.5 ) Government 12.2 % 13.4 % (1.2 ) Total 14.5 % 15.4 % (0.9 ) (a) Represents total medical expenses as a percentage of premium revenue.

The increase in net income consisted of improved profits in both of our business segments, driven by higher earnings from our Medicare and commercial lines of business. The 2003 results included expenses for asset impairments as more fully described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Premium Revenues and Medical Membership Premium revenues increased 7.3% to $12.7 billion for 2004, compared to $11.8 billion for 2003. Higher premium revenues resulted primarily from the Ochsner acquisition, as more fully described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, and an increase in Medicare Advantage and fully insured commercial premium rates. Items impacting premium rates include changes in premium and government reimbursement rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership, the mix of product offerings, and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership. Commercial segment premium revenues increased 6.1% to $7.0 billion for 2004, compared to $6.5 billion for 2003. This increase resulted from the Ochsner acquisition and increases in per member premiums in the 6% to 8% range on our fully insured commercial business partially offset by membership attrition. Per member premium increases of 6% to 8% include the impact of an increasing mix of individual products into our fully insured membership. A lower premium corresponding to lower benefits on products sold to individuals reduced our composite per member premium trend by approximately 150 to 200 basis points. Our fully insured commercial medical membership decreased 2.8%, or 66,300 members, to 2,286,500 at December 31, 2004 including the addition of 152,600 members from the acquisition of Ochsner. The decrease is primarily due to the lapse of certain under-performing large group accounts totaling approximately 94,000 members in 2004 and continued attrition due to the ongoing competitive environment within the small to mid-market group fully-insured accounts, partially offset by membership gains in the Individual product lines. We expect fully insured commercial per member premiums to increase in the 6.5% to 8.5% range for 2005, including the lowering effect of approximately 200 basis points from an anticipated higher mix of Individual membership. Government segment premium revenues increased 8.8% to $5.7 billion for 2004, compared to $5.3 billion for 2003. This increase primarily was attributable to our Medicare Advantage operations. Medicare Advantage membership was 377,200 at December 31, 2004, compared to 328,600 at December 31, 2003, an increase of 48,600 members, or 14.8%, including 33,100 members added through the acquisition of Ochsner. Per member premiums for our Medicare Advantage business increased in the 9% to 11% range for 2004, reflecting higher reimbursement associated with the MMA and including changes associated with the phase in of the risk adjusted payment methodology by CMS during 2004. See page 6 for further description of our Medicare Advantage products and the CMS risk adjusted payment methodology. For 2005, we expect premium increases per member in the same range of 9% to 11% exclusive of the CarePlus acquisition and membership growth of approximately 10% to 15% also exclusive of the CarePlus acquisition. Including the February 2005 acquisition of CarePlus, we expect Medicare Advantage enrollment of approximately 470,000 to 485,000 at December 31, 2005. TRICARE premium revenues decreased 5.4% in 2004 reflecting the transition to the new South Region contract which included a temporary loss of approximately 1 million members for 4 months. The TRICARE contract transition is more fully described on page 8. Administrative Services Fees Our administrative services fees for 2004 were $272.8 million, an increase of $1.1 million, or 0.4%, from $271.7 million for 2003. This increase resulted primarily from higher Commercial ASO membership partially offset by lower fees related to TRICARE’s change in government-contracted services. 29 Table of Contents For the Commercial segment, administrative services fees increased $43.2 million, or 35.2%, from $122.8 million for 2003 to $166.0 million for 2004. This increase corresponds to the higher level of ASO membership at December 31, 2004, which was 1,018,600 members, compared to 712,400 at December 31, 2003, an increase of 43%. Administrative services fees for the Government segment decreased $42.1 million, or 28.3%, from $148.8 million for 2003 to $106.8 million for 2004. This decline resulted from the transition to the new South Region contract which carved out certain government programs including the administration of pharmacy and medical benefits to senior members over the age of 65. We stopped providing services under these separate programs beginning June 1, 2004. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income totaled $142.1 million in 2004, an increase of $12.7 million from $129.4 million in 2003. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in the average invested balance partially offset by a decrease in net realized capital gains of approximately $8.4 million. The investment of cash flows from operations contributed to the increase in the average invested balance and added approximately $18.8 million to interest income. The average yield on investment securities was 3.6% in 2004 compared to 3.5% in 2003. Medical Expense The consolidated MER for 2004 was 84.1%, increasing 60 basis points from 83.5% for 2003 primarily due to the increase in the MER for the Commercial segment. The Commercial segment’s MER for 2004 was 83.9%, increasing 100 basis points from 2003 of 82.9%. The 100 basis point increase was primarily due to underwriting losses associated with a large customer account serving approximately 89,000 members and a very competitive pricing environment in the 2 to 300 life customer segment. The 89,000 large group account lapsed on January 1, 2005. Increasing per member premiums commensurate with claims trend becomes more difficult in a competitive pricing environment. Fully insured commercial medical cost trends are expected to rise in the range of 6.5% to 8.5% for 2005, including the lowering effect of approximately 200 basis points due to a growing mix of Individual membership. The Government segment’s MER for 2004 was 84.3%, flat when compared to 2003. The Medicare Advantage premium increases were consistent with medical cost increases for 2004 reflecting our efforts of adjusting benefit levels commensurate with reimbursement rates. SG&A Expense The consolidated SG&A expense ratio for 2004 was 14.5%, decreasing 90 basis points from 15.4% for 2003. This decrease, as well as the decrease in each of our segments’ SG&A expense ratio, is the result of revenue growth in excess of administrative cost inflation and operational efficiencies including gains from completing the consolidation of seven service centers into four during 2003. Included in 2003 were costs of $17.2 million from the impairment of the Jacksonville, Florida service center building more fully described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. These costs increased the 2003 SG&A expense ratio 10 basis points. The consolidated SG&A expense ratio is expected to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.5% for 2005 reflecting the continuing beneficial effect of growth in revenues and membership leveraging fixed costs. The Commercial segment SG&A expense ratio decreased 50 basis points from 16.9% for 2003 to 16.4% for 2004. The Commercial segment SG&A expense ratio for 2003 included an approximate 10 basis point impact from the Jacksonville, Florida building writedown. 30 Table of Contents The Government segment SG&A expense ratio decreased 120 basis points from 13.4% for 2003 to 12.2% for 2004. The Government segment SG&A expense ratio for 2003 included an approximate 20 basis point impact from the Jacksonville, Florida building writedown. Depreciation and amortization for 2004 totaled $117.8 million compared to $126.8 million for 2003, a decrease of $9.0 million, or 7.1%. Accelerated depreciation from reducing the estimated useful life of software increased depreciation expense $9.3 million in 2004 and $13.5 million in 2003. We review the carrying value and useful life of software when changes in the use of the asset in our operations indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the estimated useful life changes. Amortization of other intangible assets decreased when the other intangible assets allocated to an acquired TRICARE contract became fully amortized in the second quarter of 2003. This was partially offset by the increased amortization expense associated with other intangible assets recorded in connection with the April 1, 2004 Ochsner acquisition. Interest Expense Interest expense was $23.2 million for 2004, compared to $17.4 million for 2003, an increase of $5.8 million. This increase primarily resulted from higher average outstanding debt, due to the issuance of $300 million senior notes in August 2003. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate in 2004 of 32.7% decreased 0.9% compared to the 33.6% effective tax rate in 2003. Our effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate due primarily to tax-exempt investment income. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate. We expect an effective tax rate in 2005 of approximately 30%. This is lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the resolution of a contingent gain during the first quarter of 2005 in connection with the expiration of the statute of limitation on a tax position related to the 2000 tax year and tax exempt investment income. 31 Table of Contents Comparison of Results of Operations for 2003 and 2002 Certain financial data for our two segments was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002: Change 2003 2002 Dollars Percentage (in thousands, except ratios) Premium revenues: Fully insured $ 6,240,806 $ 5,499,033 $ 741,773 13.5 % Specialty 320,206 337,295 (17,089 ) (5.1 )% Total Commercial 6,561,012 5,836,328 724,684 12.4 % Medicare Advantage 2,527,446 2,629,597 (102,151 ) (3.9 )% TRICARE 2,249,725 2,001,474 248,251 12.4 % Medicaid 487,100 462,998 24,102 5.2 % Total Government 5,264,271 5,094,069 170,202 3.3 % Total $ 11,825,283 $ 10,930,397 $ 894,886 8.2 % Administrative services fees: Commercial $ 122,846 $ 103,203 $ 19,643 19.0 % Government 148,830 141,193 7,637 5.4 % Total $ 271,676 $ 244,396 $ 27,280 11.2 % Income (loss) before income taxes: Commercial $ 121,010 $ (15,174 ) $ 136,184 897.5 % Government 223,706 225,108 (1,402 ) (0.6 )% Total $ 344,716 $ 209,934 $ 134,782 64.2 % Medical expense ratios(a): Commercial 82.9 % 83.5 % (0.6 ) Government 84.3 % 83.8 % 0.5 Total 83.5 % 83.6 % (0.1 ) SG&A expense ratios(b): Commercial 16.9 % 18.0 % (1.1 ) Government 13.4 % 13.5 % (0.1 ) Total 15.4 % 15.9 % (0.5 ) (a) Represents total medical expenses as a percentage of premium revenue.

Medical membership was as follows at December 31, 2003 and 2002: Change 2003 2002 Members Percentage Commercial segment medical members: Fully insured 2,352,800 2,340,300 12,500 0.5 % ASO 712,400 652,200 60,200 9.2 % Total Commercial 3,065,200 2,992,500 72,700 2.4 % Government segment medical members: Medicare Advantage 328,600 344,100 (15,500 ) (4.5 )% Medicaid 468,900 506,000 (37,100 ) (7.3 )% TRICARE 1,849,700 1,755,800 93,900 5.3 % TRICARE ASO 1,057,200 1,048,700 8,500 0.8 % Total Government 3,704,400 3,654,600 49,800 1.4 % Total medical membership 6,769,600 6,647,100 122,500 1.8 % This table of financial data should be reviewed in connection with the discussion on the following pages. 32 Table of Contents Summary Net income was $228.9 million, or $1.41 per diluted share, in 2003 compared to net income of $142.8 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, in 2002. The increase in earnings resulted primarily from significant improvement in operating earnings for the Commercial segment and a decrease in expenses for asset impairments and other unusual items. Premium Revenues and Medical Membership Premium revenues increased 8.2%, to $11.8 billion, for 2003 compared to $10.9 billion for 2002. Higher premium revenues resulted primarily from increases in fully insured commercial premium rates and an increase in TRICARE premiums. Items impacting premium rates include changes in premium and government reimbursement rates, as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership, the mix of product offerings, and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership. Commercial segment premium revenues increased 12.4%, to $6.6 billion, for 2003 compared to $5.8 billion for 2002. This improvement resulted primarily from increases in per member premiums in the 12% to 14% range for 2003 on our fully insured commercial business. Additionally, our fully insured commercial medical membership increased 0.5% or 12,500 members, to 2,352,800 at December 31, 2003 compared to 2,340,300 at December 31, 2002. Government segment premium revenues increased 3.3%, to $5.3 billion, for 2003 compared to $5.1 billion for 2002. This increase primarily was attributable to our TRICARE business, partially offset by a reduction in our Medicare Advantage membership. Rates were increased upon annual renewal of our base TRICARE contract and led to an increase in TRICARE premium revenues of $248.3 million, or 12.4%, compared to 2002. Medicare Advantage membership was 328,600 at December 31, 2003 compared to 344,100 at December 31, 2002, a decline of 15,500 members, or 4.5%. This decline resulted as we exited several counties in some of our markets effective January 1, 2003 and general attrition in certain markets as a result of annual changes to benefit designs. Per member Medicare premiums increased in the 4% to 6% range for 2003. Administrative Services Fees Administrative services fees for 2003 were $271.7 million, an increase of $27.3 million from $244.4 million for 2002. For the Commercial segment, administrative services fees increased $19.6 million, or 19.0%, to $122.8 million. This increase corresponds to the higher level of ASO membership at December 31, 2003, which was 712,400 members, compared to 652,200 members at December 31, 2002 and also reflects an increase in the average fees received per member. Administrative services fees for the Government segment increased $7.6 million when comparing 2003 to 2002. This increase resulted from contractual adjustments related to TRICARE for Life, a program for seniors in which we provided medical benefit administrative services. Investment and Other Income Investment and other income totaled $129.4 million in 2003, an increase of $43.0 million from $86.4 million in 2002. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in net realized capital gains due to a $15.2 million gain from the sale of privately held venture capital investments and lower investment impairment losses, a result of an improving market. We recorded investment impairment losses of $3.2 million in 2003 compared to $27.2 million in 2002. Higher average invested balances offset lower interest rates. The average yield on investment securities was 3.5% in 2003, declining from 4.6% in 2002. Medical Expense The consolidated MER for 2003 was 83.5%, decreasing 10 basis points from 83.6% for 2002. The Commercial segment MER for 2003 was 82.9%, decreasing 60 basis points from 83.5% for 2002. The improvement in the MER primarily resulted from per member premium rate increases in excess of medical cost trends for our large group customers and the attrition of groups with higher medical expense ratios. The Government segment medical expense ratio for 2003 was 84.3%, increasing 50 basis points from 83.8% for 2002. This increase primarily was attributable to TRICARE as a result of having a higher level of revenues from bid price adjustment activity in 2002. 33 Table of Contents SG&A Expense The consolidated SG&A expense ratio decreased 50 basis points in 2003 primarily because of a decrease in severance and related employee benefit costs of $29.0 million, the absence of 2002 expenses of $30.1 million associated with a contingent contractual provider dispute and other items, offset by an increase in building impairments of $14.8 million. Increased operating efficiency led to the consolidation of seven service centers into four and an enterprise-wide workforce reduction affecting administrative expenses in both 2003 and 2002 by recording expenses for severance and related employee benefit costs and building impairments. Severance and related employee benefit costs, more fully described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, amounted to $11.2 million in 2003 and $40.2 million in 2002. The 2002 severance amount primarily related to the service center consolidation. Building impairments, more fully described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, amounted to $17.2 million in 2003 and $2.4 million in 2002. During 2002, we recorded $30.1 million of administrative expenses for a contingent contractual provider dispute and other items associated with our 1997 acquisition of Physician Corporation of America, or PCA. The $30.1 million of expenses in 2002 resulted from three issues. First, on January 28, 2003, we settled a dispute with a provider for $8.3 million primarily regarding old claims of PCA subsidiaries dating prior to Humana’s 1997 acquisition. Second, during the fourth quarter of 2002, as a December 2, 2002 trial date approached, efforts intensified to reach settlement of an old PCA shareholder dispute for periods prior to Humana’s 1997 acquisition of PCA. As a result, we accrued $15.7 million because the loss was probable and the amount could be reasonably estimated. We reversed $1.8 million of this reserve when the final settlement was paid during the third quarter of 2003. Third, in connection with an agreement reached in November 2002, we partially wrote-off a note receivable of $6.1 million from the purchaser of our workers’ compensation business which was sold in 2000. The agreement with the purchaser resulted when a significant customer contract was terminated in the fourth quarter of 2002. We acquired the workers’ compensation business in connection with the 1997 PCA acquisition. The Commercial and Government segments’ SG&A expense ratios likewise were impacted by the same items described previously. Depreciation and amortization was $126.8 million in 2003, an increase of $6.1 million, or 5.0%, from $120.7 million in 2002. The increase results from accelerated depreciation of software in 2003 of $13.5 million, as more fully described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, partially offset by lower amortization related to other intangible assets as costs associated with the government contract acquired with the TRICARE 2 and 5 transaction became fully amortized in the second quarter of 2003. Interest Expense Interest expense was $17.4 million in 2003, an increase of $0.1 million from $17.3 million in 2002. This increase primarily resulted from higher average outstanding debt due to the issuance of $300 million senior notes in August 2003 offset by lower interest rates. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate in 2003 of 33.6% increased 1.6% compared to the 32% effective tax rate in 2002. The increase in the effective tax rate primarily resulted from a lower proportion of tax-exempt investment income to pretax income. During 2002, the Internal Revenue Service completed their audit of all open years prior to 2000 which resulted in a favorable adjustment to the estimated accrual for income taxes of approximately $32.6 million. This was offset by an increase of approximately $24.5 million in the capital loss valuation allowance after we reevaluated probable capital gain realization in the allowable carryforward period based upon our capital gain experience beginning in 2000 and consideration of alternative tax planning strategies. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate. 34 Table of Contents Liquidity Our primary sources of cash include receipts of premiums, administrative services fees, investment income, and proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities and from borrowings. Our primary uses of cash include disbursements for claims payments, administrative expenses, interest expense, and taxes, purchases of investment securities and capital expenditures and payments on borrowings. Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $580.1 million at December 31, 2004 from $931.4 million at December 31, 2003. The change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is summarized as follows: 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 347,809 $ 413,140 $ 321,408 Net cash used in investing activities (624,081 ) (382,837 ) (204,974 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (75,053 ) 179,744 (46,497 ) (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (351,325 ) $ 210,047 $ 69,937 Cash Flow from Operating Activities Our operating cash flows in 2004 were significantly impacted by the timing of the Medicare Advantage premium remittance which is payable to us on the first day of each month. When the first day of a month falls on a weekend or holiday, we have historically received this payment at the end of the previous month. As such, the Medicare Advantage receipts for January 2004 of $211.9 million and January 2003 of $205.8 million were received in December 2003 and December 2002, respectively, because January 1 is a holiday. This timing accounts for a significant portion of the unearned revenues balance on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2003. Beginning in 2005, the monthly premium payment schedule includes a change in timing from previous practice. As a result of this change, the January 2005 payment of $290.3 million originally scheduled to be received on Friday, December 31, 2004, was changed to Monday, January 3, 2005, or one business day later. Therefore, we received only 11 monthly Medicare Advantage premium remittances during 2004 versus 12 monthly premium remittances during 2003. Other than the impact from the timing of the Medicare Advantage premium receipts, the increase in net income and cash generated from changes in working capital increased our operating cash flow in 2004 compared to 2003. The most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of receipts for premiums and administrative services fees and payments of medical expenses. We illustrate these changes with the following summary of receivables and medical and other expenses payable. The detail of total net receivables was as follows at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: Change 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 (in thousands) TRICARE: Base receivable $ 396,355 $ 266,656 $ 197,544 $ 129,699 $ 69,112 Bid price adjustments (BPAs) 25,601 92,875 104,044 (67,274 ) (11,169 ) Change orders 6,021 7,073 57,630 (1,052 ) (50,557 ) 427,977 366,604 359,218 61,373 7,386 Less: long-term portion of BPAs — (38,794 ) (86,471 ) 38,794 47,677 TRICARE subtotal 427,977 327,810 272,747 100,167 55,063 Commercial and other 186,144 178,577 146,882 7,567 31,695 Allowance for doubtful accounts (34,506 ) (40,400 ) (30,178 ) 5,894 (10,222 ) Total net receivables $ 579,615 $ 465,987 $ 389,451 113,628 76,536 Reconciliation to cash flow statement: Change in long-term receivables (52,583 ) (61,316 ) Provision for doubtful accounts 6,433 7,416 Receivables from acquisition (16,420 ) — Change in receivables in cash flow statement $ 51,058 $ 22,636 35 Table of Contents TRICARE base receivables increased in 2004 due to the transition to the reimbursement model under the South Region contract beginning on August 1, 2004. Under our former TRICARE contracts with a fixed price, we bore the cost of changes in the underlying pattern of health care for which the government was at risk until subsequently reimbursed in a later period through a bid price adjustment, or BPA process. The fixed price and BPA process added variability to our revenues, related receivables and operating cash flows because the timing of the settlement was uncertain. Under the new TRICARE South region contract, the fixed price and BPA process was eliminated and replaced with a new reimbursement model. Under the new reimbursement model, claims paid are reimbursed by the federal government generally within 30 business days. The delivery of health care services results in a lag between the time the service is provided and ultimately reimbursed by the federal government, typically three months. Thus, TRICARE receivables are generally collected over a three to four month period. Likewise, TRICARE medical claims payable are generally paid over the same three to four month period. TRICARE base receivables increased in 2003 as rates under our base TRICARE contract increased upon the annual renewal of the contracts for Regions 3 and 4 and Regions 2 and 5. The detail of medical and other expenses payable was as follows at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: Change 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 (in thousands) IBNR(1) $ 1,164,518 $ 1,043,360 $ 946,596 $ 121,158 $ 96,764 Reported claims in process(2) 97,801 74,262 105,422 23,539 (31,160 ) Other medical expenses payable(3) 159,691 154,534 90,113 5,157 64,421 Total medical and other expenses payable $ 1,422,010 $ 1,272,156 $ 1,142,131 149,854 130,025 Reconciliation to cash flow statement: Medical and other expenses payable from acquisition (71,063 ) — Change in medical and other expenses payable in cash flow statement $ 78,791 $ 130,025 (1) IBNR represents an estimate of medical expenses payable for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) at the balance sheet date. The level of IBNR is primarily impacted by membership levels, medical claim trends and the receipt cycle time, which represents the length of time between when a claim is initially incurred and when the claim form is received (i.e. a shorter time span results in a lower IBNR). (2) Reported claims in process represents the estimated valuation of processed claims that are in the post claim adjudication process, which consists of administrative functions such as audit and check batching and handling. (3) Other medical expenses payable includes capitation and pharmacy payables. The balance due to our pharmacy benefit administrator fluctuates due to bi-weekly payments and the month-end cutoff. Medical and other expenses payable increased during 2004 and 2003 due primarily to medical claims inflation. Changes in other liabilities primarily resulted from the timing of payments for taxes, payments related to our TRICARE contract including subcontractors and general vendor payables. Cash Flow from Investing Activities During 2004, we paid $141.8 million to acquire Ochsner, net of $15.3 million of cash acquired. We reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows at an increasing rate over the last several years in investment securities, primarily short-duration fixed income securities, totaling $407.3 million in 2004, $283.1 million in 2003 and $17.9 million in 2002. Our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our technology initiatives and administrative facilities necessary for activities such as claims processing, billing and collections, 36 Table of Contents medical utilization review, and customer service. Total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were $114.1 million in 2004, $101.3 million in 2003, and $112.1 million in 2002. Excluding acquisitions, we expect our total capital expenditures in 2005 to be approximately $115 million, most of which will be used for our technology initiatives and improvement of administrative facilities. Proceeds from the sale of property and equipment relate primarily to consolidating our service centers in Jacksonville and San Antonio including the sale of the Jacksonville office tower in 2004 for $14.8 million and a San Antonio office building for $5.9 million in 2003. Cash Flow from Financing Activities We repurchased 3.8 million common shares for $67.0 million at an average price of $17.83 per share in 2004, 3.7 million common shares for $44.1 million at an average price of $12.03 per share in 2003 and 6.4 million common shares for $74.0 million at an average price of $11.56 per share in 2002. Authorization for additional common share repurchases expired in January 2005. During 2003, we issued $300 million 6.3% senior notes due August 1, 2018 in order to term-out our short-term debt and take advantage of historically low interest rates. In addition, during 2003 we received proceeds of $31.6 million in exchange for new swap agreements. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information regarding our borrowings and swap agreements. Credit Agreement On September 29, 2004, we replaced our existing credit agreements with a new 5-year $600 million unsecured revolving credit agreement which will expire in September 2009. We previously maintained two unsecured revolving credit agreements consisting of a $265 million, 4-year revolving credit agreement and a $265 million, 364-day revolving credit agreement. Under the agreement, at our option, we can borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis. The revolving credit portion of the agreement bears interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on LIBOR plus a spread. The spread, which varies depending on our credit ratings, ranges from 50 to 112.5 basis points. We also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization. This facility fee, currently 15 basis points, may fluctuate between 12.5 and 37.5 basis points, depending upon our credit ratings. In addition, a utilization fee of 12.5 basis points is payable for any day in which borrowings under the facility exceeds 50% of the total $600 million commitment. The competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate basis, at our option. The 5-year $600 million credit agreement contains customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default, including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of net worth, minimum interest coverage, and maximum leverage ratios. At December 31, 2004, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenant requirements. The terms of this credit agreement also includes standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing, including a customary material adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to borrow. We have not experienced a material adverse effect, and we know of no circumstances or events which would be reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect. We do not believe the material adverse effect clause poses a material funding risk to Humana in the future. We have other relationships, including financial advisory and banking, with some of the parties to the new agreement. The maximum amount available for borrowing under the credit agreement was $594.6 million at December 31, 2004, reduced from the $600 million due to securing letters of credit of $5.4 million under the credit agreement. No amounts have ever been drawn on these letters of credit. On February 16, 2005, we paid approximately $450 million in cash for CarePlus including approximately $32 million of statutory capital and surplus in excess of the minimum statutory requirement as well as estimated transaction costs. We financed the transaction with $156 million of cash on hand and $294 million of borrowings under our credit agreement. After the CarePlus transaction, we have $300.6 million of remaining borrowing capacity under the credit agreement. 37 Table of Contents Commercial Paper Program We maintain and may issue short-term debt securities under a commercial paper program when market conditions allow. The program is backed by our credit agreement described above. Aggregate borrowings under both the credit agreement and commercial paper program generally will not exceed $600 million. In connection with the credit arrangement, the conduit commercial paper program allowing indirect access to the commercial paper market through a third party was cancelled. At December 31, 2004, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Shelf Registration Our universal shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission allows us to register debt or equity securities, from time to time, with the amount, price and terms to be determined at the time of the sale. After the issuance of our $300 million, 6.30% senior notes in August 2003, we have up to $300 million remaining from a total of $600 million under the universal shelf registration. The universal shelf registration allows us to use the net proceeds from any future sales of our securities for our operations and for other general corporate purposes, including repayment or refinancing of borrowings, working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, or the repurchase of our outstanding securities. We believe our financial condition is strong and that our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity markets and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and fund future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures. However, adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future. Our investment-grade credit rating at December 31, 2004 was Baa3 according to Moody’s Investors Services, Inc., or Moody’s, and BBB, according to Standard & Poor’s Corporation, or S&P. A downgrade to Ba2 or lower by Moody’s and BB or lower by S&P would give the counterparties of three of our interest rate swap agreements with a $300 million notional amount, the right, but not the obligation, to cancel the interest rate swap agreement. If cancelled, we would pay or receive an amount based on the fair market value of the swap agreement. Assuming these swap agreements had been cancelled on December 31, 2004, we would have received $12.1 million, net. Other than the swap agreements, adverse changes in our credit ratings may not create, increase, or accelerate any liabilities. In addition, we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry. Our parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. Our parent company liquidity improved during 2004 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increasing $39.9 million to $439.3 million at December 31, 2004 compared to $399.4 million at December 31, 2003. See Schedule 1 to this Form 10-K beginning on page 105 for our parent company financial information. Regulatory Requirements Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans, or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., our parent company, require minimum levels of equity, as well as limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required. As of December 31, 2004, we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $1,185.5 million in our state regulated health insurance subsidiaries. Each of these subsidiaries was in compliance with applicable statutory requirements which aggregated $717.2 million. Although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume, product mix, and the quality of assets held, minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level. Certain states rely on risk-based capital requirements, or RBC, to define the required levels of equity. RBC is a model developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to 38 Table of Contents monitor an entity’s solvency. This calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels. If RBC were adopted by all states at December 31, 2004, each of our subsidiaries would be in compliance and we would have $405.6 million of aggregate capital and surplus above any of the levels that require corrective action under RBC. Contractual Obligations We are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to December 31, 2004 as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than5 Years (in thousands) Debt(1) $ 898,288 $ 648 $ 301,114 $ 295,080 $ 301,446 Interest(2) 229,563 43,439 56,804 40,518 88,802 Operating leases(3) 232,654 65,088 84,931 52,775 29,860 Purchase and other obligations(4) 43,787 27,693 13,154 2,044 896 Total $ 1,404,292 $ 136,868 $ 456,003 $ 390,417 $ 421,004 (1) Debt includes $294 million of borrowings under the Credit Agreement which matures on September 28, 2009 related to the February 16, 2005 CarePlus acquisition. Debt payments could be accelerated upon violation of debt covenants. We believe the likelihood of debt covenant violation is remote. (2) Interest includes the estimated contractual interest payments under our debt agreements net of the effect of the associated swapagreements assuming no change in the variable LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2004. (3) We lease facilities, computer hardware, and other equipment under long-term operating leases that are noncancelable and expire on various dates through 2017. We sublease facilities or partial facilities to third party tenants for space not used in our operations which partially mitigates our operating lease commitments. An operating lease, accounted for under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases, is a type of off-balance sheet arrangement. Assuming we acquired the asset, rather than leased, we would have recognized a liability for the financing of these assets. See also Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. (4) Purchase and other obligations include agreements to purchase services, primarily information technology related services, or to make improvements to real estate that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum levels of service to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the appropriate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Indemnifications and Guarantees Our operating lease of an airplane, which expires January 1, 2010, provides for a residual value payment of no more than $4.8 million at the end of the lease term. At the end of the term we have the right to exercise a purchase option or the airplane can be sold to a third party. If we decide not to exercise our purchase option, we must pay the lessor a maximum amount of $4.8 million. This amount will be reduced by the net sales proceeds in excess of $4.2 million from the sale of the airplane to a third party. Through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities, certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by Humana Inc., our parent company, in the event of insolvency for (1), member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency; (2), benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged; and (3), payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency. Our parent also has guaranteed the obligations of our TRICARE subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us, or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may 39 Table of Contents include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial. Related Parties No related party transactions had a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Certain immaterial related party transactions are discussed in our Proxy Statement for the meeting to be held April 26, 2005—see “Certain Transactions with Management and Others.” Market Risk-Sensitive Financial Instruments and Positions The level of our pretax earnings is subject to risk due to changes in investment income from our fixed income portfolio which is partially offset by both our debt position and the short-term duration of the fixed income investment portfolio. We evaluated the impact on our investment income and debt expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100, 200 and 300 basis points over the next twelve-month period, as reflected in the following table. The modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change in pretax earnings considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt, which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelve-month period. This evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may effect interest income, including, among others, unexpected changes of cash flow into and out of the portfolio, shifts in the asset mix between taxable and tax-exempt securities, and spread changes specific to various investment categories. In the past ten years, changes in 3 month LIBOR rates during the year have exceeded 300 basis points twice, have not changed between 200 and 300 basis points, have changed between 100 and 200 basis points once and have changed by less than 100 basis points seven times. LIBOR was 2.56% at December 31, 2004. Our model assumed the maximum possible reduction in LIBOR could not exceed 256 basis points.

No termination notices were received in connection with our currently existing contracts. In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, or MMA, was signed into law. We believe MMA offers new opportunities in our Medicare programs, including our HMO, PPO, and Private Fee-For-Service products. We have made additional investments in the Medicare Advantage program to enhance our ability to participate in these expanded programs. 40 Table of Contents Our TRICARE South Region contract, which we were awarded in 2003, covers approximately 2.9 million beneficiaries. The South Region is one of the three regions in the United States as defined by the Department of Defense. The contract is for a five-year period subject to annual renewals at the federal government’s option with the second option period scheduled to begin April 1, 2005. We currently have Medicaid contracts with the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration through June 30, 2005. Our other Medicaid contracts are in Florida and Illinois, and are annual contracts. As of December 31, 2004, Puerto Rico accounted for approximately 83% of our total Medicaid membership. The loss of any of the contracts above or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action, including reductions in premium payments to us, or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Legal Proceedings We are party to a variety of legal actions in the ordinary course of business, including employment matters, breach of contract actions, tort claims, and shareholder suits involving alleged securities fraud. A description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under “Legal Proceedings” of Item 3 in Part 1. We cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty, and we are incurring expenses in defense of these matters. In addition, recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. Therefore, these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to medical cost and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities, goodwill, and long-lived assets. These estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events, and accordingly, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Medical Expense Recognition Medical expenses are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported, or IBNR. IBNR represents a substantial portion of our medical and other expenses payable as follows: December 31,2004 Percentageof Total December 31,2003 Percentageof Total (dollars in thousands) IBNR $ 1,164,518 81.9 % $ 1,043,360 82.0 % Reported claims in process 97,801 6.9 % 74,262 5.8 % Other medical expenses payable 159,691 11.2 % 154,534 12.2 % Total medical and other expenses payable $ 1,422,010 100.0 % $ 1,272,156 100.0 % Estimating IBNR is complex and involves a significant amount of judgment. Accordingly, it represents a critical accounting estimate. Changes in this estimate can materially affect, either favorably or unfavorably, our results from operations and overall financial position. For example, a 100 basis point, or 1 percent, change in the 41 Table of Contents estimate of our medical and other expenses payable at December 31, 2004, which represents approximately 40% of total liabilities, would require an adjustment of approximately $14 million in a future period in which a revision in the estimate became known. We develop our estimate for IBNR using actuarial methodologies and assumptions, primarily based upon historical claim payment and claim receipt patterns, as well as historical medical cost trends. Depending on the period for which incurred claims are estimated, we apply a different method in determining our estimate. For periods prior to the most recent three months, the key assumption used in estimating our IBNR is that the completion factor pattern remains consistent over a rolling 12-month period after adjusting for known changes in claim inventory levels and known changes in claim payment processes. Completion factors result from the calculation of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have historically been adjudicated as of the reporting period. For the most recent three months, the incurred claims are estimated primarily from a trend analysis based upon per member per month claims trends developed from our historical experience in the preceding months, adjusted for known changes in estimates of recent hospital and drug utilization data, provider contracting changes, changes in benefit levels, product mix, and weekday seasonality. The completion factor method is used for the months of incurred claims prior to the most recent three months because the historical percentage of claims processed for those months is at a level sufficient to produce a consistently reliable result. Conversely, for the most recent three months of incurred claims, the volume of claims processed historically is not at a level sufficient to produce a reliable result, which therefore requires us to examine historical trend patterns as the primary method of evaluation. Medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy. The drivers of medical cost trends include increases in the utilization of hospital facilities, physician services, prescription drugs, and new medical technologies, as well as the inflationary effect on the cost per unit of each of these expense components. Other external factors such as government-mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, increases in medical services capacity, direct to consumer advertising for prescription drugs and medical services, an aging population, catastrophes, and epidemics also may impact medical cost trends. Internal factors such as system conversions, claims processing cycle times, changes in medical management practices and changes in provider contracts also may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends. All of these factors are considered in estimating IBNR and in estimating the per member per month claims trend for purposes of determining the reserve for the most recent three months. Additionally, we continually prepare and review follow-up studies to assess the reasonableness of the estimates generated by our process and methods over time. The results of these studies are also considered in determining the reserve for the most recent three months. Each of these factors requires significant judgment by management. The completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the IBNR estimate. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on December 31, 2004 data: Completion Factor(a): Claims Trend Factor(b): (Decrease)Increasein Factor Increase(Decrease) inMedical andOther ExpensesPayable (Decrease)Increasein Factor (Decrease)Increase inMedical andOther ExpensesPayable (dollars in thousands) (3 %) $ 141,000 (3 %) $ (66,000 ) (2 %) $ 92,000 (2 %) $ (44,000 ) (1 %) $ 45,000 (1 %) $ (23,000 ) 1 % $ (43,000 ) 1 % $ 20,000 2 % $ (84,000 ) 2 % $ 42,000 3 % $ (123,000 ) 3 % $ 63,000 (a) Reflects estimated potential changes in medical and other expenses payable caused by changes in completion factors for incurred months prior to the most recent three months. 42 Table of Contents (b) Reflects estimated potential changes in medical and other expenses payable caused by changes in annualized claims trend used for the estimation of per member per month incurred claims for the most recent three months. Most medical claims are paid within a few months of the member receiving service from a physician or other health care provider. As a result, these liabilities generally are described as having a “short-tail”, which causes less than 2% of our medical and other expenses payable as of the end of any given period to be outstanding for more than 12 months. As such, we expect that substantially all of the 2004 estimate of medical and other expenses payable will be known and paid during 2005. Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards. Actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for IBNR have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient, or such that the liabilities established for IBNR are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. Adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate. Therefore, in many situations, the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice. IBNR established in connection with our TRICARE contracts is typically more difficult to estimate than for our other operations, because there are more variables that impact the estimate. These variables include continual changes in the number of eligible beneficiaries, changes in the utilization of military treatment facilities and changes in levels of benefits versus the original contract provisions. Many of these variables are impacted significantly by an increase or decrease in military activity involving the United States armed forces. Additionally, we transitioned to the new TRICARE South Region contract during the latter half of 2004. Accordingly, our historical claims experience and familiarity with claim payment patterns for this block of business is not as mature as our other lines of business. We have considered all of these factors in establishing our IBNR estimate. Each of these factors required significant judgment by management. As more fully described on page 45, our TRICARE contract contains risk-sharing provisions with the Department of Defense and with subcontractors, which effectively limit profits and losses when actual claim experience varies from the targeted medical claim amount negotiated in our annual bid. As a result of these contract provisions, the impact of changes in estimates for prior year TRICARE medical claims payable on our results of operations is reduced substantially, whether positive or negative. As more fully described on pages 10 and 11, we have a substantial percentage of our Medicare and Medicaid membership under risk-sharing arrangements with providers. Accordingly, the impact of changes in estimates for prior year medical claims payable on our results from operations that are attributable to our Medicare and Medicaid lines of business may also be significantly reduced, whether positive or negative. 43 Table of Contents The following table provides a reconciliation of changes in medical and other expenses payable for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Balances at January 1 $ 1,272,156 $ 1,142,131 $ 1,086,386 Acquisitions 71,063 — — Incurred related to: Current year 10,763,105 9,955,491 9,125,915 Prior years (93,458 ) (76,070 ) 12,281 Total incurred 10,669,647 9,879,421 9,138,196 Paid related to: Current year (9,504,331 ) (8,710,393 ) (8,002,610 ) Prior years (1,086,525 ) (1,039,003 ) (1,079,841 ) Total paid (10,590,856 ) (9,749,396 ) (9,082,451 ) Balances at December 31 $ 1,422,010 $ 1,272,156 $ 1,142,131 Amounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims are ultimately settled. Negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims being ultimately settled for amounts less than originally estimated (favorable development). Positive amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims ultimately being settled for amounts greater than originally estimated (unfavorable development). As summarized in the previous table, claim reserve balances at December 31, 2003 ultimately settled during 2004 for $93.5 million less than the amounts originally estimated, representing 0.9% of medical claim expenses incurred in 2003. During 2003, claim reserve balances at December 31, 2002 ultimately settled for $76.1 million less than the amounts originally estimated, representing 0.8% of medical claim expenses recorded in 2002. This $17.4 million change in the amounts incurred related to prior years resulted primarily from favorable development in our Medicare line of business as a result of better than expected utilization in the latter half of 2003. The substantial majority of this favorable development in the Medicare business occurred under risk-sharing arrangements with providers, which resulted in minimizing the impact on our reported 2004 results from operations. During 2002, claim reserve balances at December 31, 2001 ultimately settled for $12.3 million more than the amounts originally recorded, representing 0.1% of medical claim expenses recorded in 2001. The $88.4 million change in the amounts incurred related to prior years during 2003 consists of $68.3 million attributable to our TRICARE operations with the remaining $20.1 million primarily resulting from fourth quarter 2002 utilization in our commercial medical products ultimately being lower than originally estimated. The $68.3 million change in TRICARE incurred related to prior years resulted from establishing medical expense reserves resulting from enhanced benefits enacted for TRICARE beneficiaries as a result of congressional legislation, as well as lower than originally estimated utilization of medical services by TRICARE beneficiaries in the second half of 2002. Revenue Recognition We generally establish one-year contracts with commercial employer groups, subject to cancellation by the employer group’s 30-day written notice. Our contracts with federal or state governments are generally multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions with the exception of our Medicare Advantage contracts with the federal government which renew annually. Our commercial contracts establish rates on a per member basis for each month of coverage. Except for TRICARE contracts discussed in the following section, our government contracts also establish monthly rates per member but may have additional amounts due to us based on items 44 Table of Contents such as age, working status, or specific health issues of the member. Changes in revenues from CMS for our Medicare Advantage products resulting from the periodic changes in risk adjustment scores for our membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. Premium revenues and ASO fees are estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates. In addition, we adjust revenues for estimated changes in an employer’s enrollment and customers that ultimately may fail to pay. Enrollment changes not yet reported by an employer group, an individual, or the government, also known as retroactive membership adjustments, are estimated based on historical trends. We monitor the collectibility of specific accounts, the aging of receivables, as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, and reflect any required adjustments in the current period’s revenue. We bill and collect premium and ASO fee remittances from employer groups, the federal and state governments, and individual Medicare Advantage members monthly. Premium and ASO fee receivables are presented net of allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts and retroactive membership adjustments. Premiums and ASO fees received prior to the period members are entitled to receive services are recorded as unearned revenues. TRICARE Contract In 2004, TRICARE revenues represented 17% of total premiums and administrative services fees. The single TRICARE contract for the South Region includes multiple revenue generating activities and as such was evaluated under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. We allocate the consideration to the various components based on the relative fair values of the components. TRICARE revenues consist generally of (1) an insurance premium for assuming underwriting risk for the cost of civilian healthcare services delivered to eligible beneficiaries; (2) healthcare services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn reimbursed by the federal government; and, (3) administrative service fees related to claim processing, customer service, enrollment, disease management and other services. We recognize the insurance premium as revenue ratably over the period coverage is provided. Health care services reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period health care services are provided. Administrative service fees are recognized as revenue in the period services are performed. The TRICARE contract contains provisions whereby the federal government bears a substantial portion of the risk associated with financing the cost of health benefits. Annually, we negotiate a target healthcare cost amount, or target cost, with the federal government and determine an underwriting fee. Any variance from the target cost is shared. We earn more revenue or incur additional costs based on the variance in actual health care costs versus the negotiated target cost. We receive 20% for any cost underrun, subject to a ceiling that limits the underwriting profit to 10% of the target cost. We pay 20% for any cost overrun, subject to a floor that limits the underwriting loss to negative 4% of the target cost. A final settlement occurs 12 to 18 months after the end of each contract year to which it applies. We defer the recognition of any revenues for favorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost underruns until the amount is determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. We estimate and recognize unfavorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost overruns currently in operations as an increase in medical expenses. The TRICARE contract contains provisions to negotiate change orders. Change orders occur when we perform services or incur costs under the directive of the federal government that were not originally specified in our contract. Under federal regulations we may be entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price in these situations. Change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year. We record revenue applicable to change orders when services are performed and these amounts are determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Our former TRICARE contracts for Regions 3 and 4 and Regions 2 and 5, which expired during 2004, contained provisions for not only change orders but for bid price adjustments, or BPAs as well. There are no provisions for BPAs in our current TRICARE contract. BPAs were utilized to retroactively adjust revenues for 45 Table of Contents the impact of the items for which the federal government retains risk, including the risks associated with changes in usage levels at military treatment facilities, or MTFs, change in the number of persons eligible for TRICARE benefits, and medical unit cost inflation. We work closely with the federal government to obtain and review eligibility and MTF workload data, and to quantify and negotiate amounts recoverable or payable under our contractual BPA requirements. Final settlement of BPAs occurs only at specified intervals, typically in excess of 6 months after the end of a contract year. We record revenues applicable to BPAs when these amounts are determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Investment Securities Investment securities totaled $2,494.1 million, or 44% of total assets at December 31, 2004. Debt securities totaled $2,452.0 million, or 98% of our total investment portfolio. More than 94% of our debt securities were of investment-grade quality, with an average credit rating of AA+ by Standard & Poor’s at December 31, 2004. Most of the debt securities that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end (BB or better) of the non-investment grade spectrum. Our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types. Duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in market value and changes in interest rates, providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our debt securities to changes in interest rates. However, actual market values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration. The average duration of our debt securities was approximately 3.3 years at December 31, 2004. Based on this duration, a 1% increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our debt securities by approximately $80 million. Our investment securities are categorized as available for sale and, as a result, are stated at fair value. Fair value of publicly traded debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices. Non-traded debt securities are priced independently by a third party vendor. Fair value of venture capital debt securities that are privately held, or where an observable quoted market price does not exist, are estimated using a variety of valuation methodologies. Such methodologies include reviewing the value ascribed to the most recent financing, comparing the security with securities of publicly traded companies in a similar line of business, and reviewing the underlying financial performance including estimating discounted cash flows. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of applicable deferred taxes, are included as a component of stockholders’ equity until realized from a sale or impairment. Gross unrealized losses and fair value, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at December 31, 2004, included the following: Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total Fair Value UnrealizedLosses FairValue UnrealizedLosses Fair Value UnrealizedLosses (in thousands) U.S. Government obligations $ 486,209 $ (3,717 ) $ 4,351 $ (136 ) $ 490,560 $ (3,853 ) Tax exempt municipal securities 316,913 (3,346 ) 26,869 (647 ) 343,782 (3,993 ) Corporate and other securities 171,048 (1,846 ) 32,719 (1,418 ) 203,767 (3,264 ) Mortgage-backed securities 28,865 (430 ) 16,581 (753 ) 45,446 (1,183 ) Redeemable preferred stocks 6,266 (158 ) 1,238 (12 ) 7,504 (170 ) Debt securities 1,009,301 (9,497 ) 81,758 (2,966 ) 1,091,059 (12,463 ) Non-redeemable preferred stocks 8,455 (240 ) 10,789 (329 ) 19,244 (569 ) Total investment securities $ 1,017,756 $ (9,737 ) $ 92,547 $ (3,295 ) $ 1,110,303 $ (13,032 ) We regularly evaluate our investment securities for impairment. We consider factors affecting the investee, factors affecting the industry the investee operates within, and general debt and equity market trends. We consider the length of time an investment’s fair value has been below carrying value, the near term prospects for 46 Table of Contents recovery to carrying value and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or market recovery is realized. If and when a determination is made that a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary, the related investment is written down to its estimated fair value through earnings. The risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations; facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time; or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment. The determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment. The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments. The status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment. Unrealized losses at December 31, 2004 resulted from 254 positions from a total of 797 positions held. Less than 4% of the carrying value of our consolidated investment securities have been in an unrealized loss position greater than one year. The unrealized losses at December 31, 2004 generally can be attributed to changes in interest rates. All issuers of securities trading at an unrealized loss remain current on all contractual payments and we believe it is probable that we will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the debt securities. After taking into account these and other factors, including our ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery or maturity, we determined the unrealized losses on these investment securities were temporary. There were no impairment losses recorded in 2004. We recorded impairment losses of $3.2 million in 2003 and $27.2 million in 2002 after an evaluation indicated that a decline in fair value below the cost basis was other than temporary. Goodwill and Long-lived Assets At December 31, 2004, goodwill and other long-lived assets represented 23% of total assets and 63% of total stockholders’ equity. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that we not amortize goodwill to earnings, but instead that we test goodwill at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. A reporting unit is one level below our Commercial and Government segments. The Commercial segment’s two reporting units consist of fully and self-insured medical and specialty. The Government segment’s three reporting units consist of Medicare Advantage, TRICARE and Medicaid. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition. Our strategy, long-range business plan, and annual planning process supports our goodwill impairment tests. These tests are based primarily on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows under several scenarios. We used a range of discount rates that correspond to our weighted-average cost of capital. Key assumptions including changes in membership, premium yields, medical cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our long-range business plan and annual planning process. If these assumptions differ from actual, the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected. Goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss. Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets. These assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life, and are subject to impairment reviews. We periodically review long-lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. In assessing recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist, and, if so, estimate fair value. We also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long-lived assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life, including accelerating depreciation for these assets. We recognized losses due to 47 Table of Contents impairment and accelerated depreciation from changes in estimated useful life of $9.3 million in 2004, $30.8 million in 2003 and $2.4 million in 2002. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB 51, or FIN 46. The primary objectives of FIN 46 are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights (variable interest entities, or VIEs) and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the VIE (the primary beneficiary). In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46-R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities—an interpretation of ARB 51 (revised December 2003), which amended certain provisions of FIN 46 and delayed implementation for entities that are not considered special purpose entities until the first quarter of 2004. As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or SPEs, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of December 31, 2004, we are not involved in any SPE transactions. The adoption of FIN 46 or FIN 46-R did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, or Statement 123R, which requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock-based compensation. This requirement represents a significant change because fixed-based stock option awards, a predominate form of stock compensation for us, were not recognized as compensation expense under APB 25. Statement 123R requires the cost of the award, as determined on the date of grant at fair value, be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (usually the vesting period). The grant-date fair value of the award will be estimated using option-pricing models. We are required to adopt Statement 123R no later than July 1, 2005 under one of three transition methods, including a prospective, retrospective and combination approach. We disclose on page 67 the effect of expensing stock options under a fair value approach using the Black-Scholes pricing model for 2004, 2003 and 2002. We currently are evaluating all of the provisions of Statement 123R and the expected effect on us including, among other items, reviewing compensation strategies related to stock-based awards, selecting an option pricing model and determining the transition method. In March 2004, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 03-1, or EITF 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments. EITF 03-1 includes new guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses on certain debt and equity investments when the fair value of the investment security is less than its carrying value. In September 2004, the FASB delayed the previously scheduled third quarter 2004 effective date until the issuance of additional implementation guidance, expected in 2005. Upon issuance of a final standard, we will evaluate the impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Cautionary Statements This document includes both historical and forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are made within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and we are including this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events, trends and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, among other things, the information discussed below. In making these 48 Table of Contents statements, we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results. Our business is highly complicated, regulated and competitive with many different factors affecting results. If the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members, or if our estimates of medical claim reserves based upon our estimates of future medical claims are inadequate, our profitability could decline. We use a significant portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members. These costs include claims payments, capitation payments, allocations of some centralized expenses and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members. These costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members. Generally, premiums in the health care business are fixed for one-year periods. Accordingly, costs we incur in excess of our medical cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums. We estimate the costs of our future medical claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns, medical inflation, historical developments, including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns, and other relevant factors. We also record medical claims reserves for future payments. We continually review estimates of future payments relating to medical claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves. However, increases in the use or cost of services by our members, competition, government regulations and many other factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums. These factors may include: • increased use of medical facilities and services, including prescription drugs; • increased cost of such services; • the Company’s membership mix; • variances in actual versus estimated levels of cost associated with new products, benefits or lines of business, product changes or benefit level changes; • membership in markets lacking adequate provider networks; • changes in the demographic characteristics of an account or market; • termination of capitation arrangements resulting in the transfer of membership to fee-for-service arrangements; • changes or reductions of our utilization management functions such as preauthorization of services, concurrent review or requirements for physician referrals; • possible changes in our pharmacy rebate program with drug manufacturers; • catastrophes, including acts of terrorism, epidemics, or severe weather; • the introduction of new or costly treatments, including new technologies; • medical cost inflation; and • new government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes. Failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient medical claim reserves may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. If we do not design and price our products properly and competitively, our membership and profitability could decline. We are in a highly competitive industry. Many of our competitors are more established in the health care industry and have a larger market share and greater financial resources than we do in some markets. In addition, 49 Table of Contents other companies may enter our markets in the future, including emerging competitors in the Medicare Advantage program and in consumer-directed health plans, such as Health Savings Accounts (“HSA”). We believe that barriers to entry in many markets are not substantial, so the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily, and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors. Contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually. While health plans compete on the basis of many factors, including service and the quality and depth of provider networks, we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition. In addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs, we face intense competitive pressure to contain premium prices. Factors such as business consolidations, strategic alliances, legislative reform and marketing practices create pressure to contain premium price increases, despite being faced with increasing medical costs. The commercial pricing environment, particularly in the 2 to 300 member groups, is extremely competitive, and several of our competitors, including public and not-for-profit companies, are pricing aggressively to gain market share. Premium increases, introduction of new product designs, and our relationship with our providers in various markets, among other issues, could also affect our membership levels. Other actions that could affect membership levels include the possible exit of or entrance to Medicare Advantage or Commercial markets. To determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to managed care plans, CMS has implemented a risk adjustment model that uses diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings (hospital outpatient department and physician visits). CMS has also redesigned its data collection and processing system to reduce administrative data burden on Medicare health plans. In 2004, the portion of risk adjusted payment was increased to 30 percent, from 10 percent in 2003. The 100% phase-in of risk adjusted payment will be completed in 2007; the portion of risk adjusted payment will increase to 50 percent in 2005 and 75 percent in 2006. Under the new risk adjustment methodology, Humana and all managed care organizations must collect, capture and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to CMS twice a year. As a result of this process and the phasing in of the risk adjustment methodology described above, our CMS monthly payments per member may change materially, either favorably or unfavorably. If we do not compete effectively in our markets, if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets to keep or increase our market share, if membership does not increase as we expect, or if it declines, or if we lose accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our future performance depends in large part upon our management team’s ability to execute our strategy to position the Company for the future. This strategy includes the growth of our Commercial segment business, with emphasis on our ASO and individual products, introduction of new products and benefit designs, including our Smart, consumer-choice products, opportunities created with the new Medicare Advantage products, the adoption of new technologies and the integration of acquired businesses and contracts. We believe that by combining our abilities in product design, clinical programs and consumer engagement, we can achieve cost savings for our customers and our company. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to position the Company for future growth or that the products we design will be accepted. Failure to implement this strategy or to contain our administrative expenses in line with our membership may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 50 Table of Contents If we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data, or to strategically implement new information systems, or to protect our proprietary rights to our systems, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our business depends significantly on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to run our business. Our business strategy involves providing members and providers with easy to use products that leverage our information to meet their needs. Our ability to adequately price our products and services, provide effective and efficient service to our customers, and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity of the data in our information systems. As a result of our past and on-going acquisition activities, we have acquired additional systems. We have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate, have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities, and are gradually migrating existing business to fewer systems. If the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effectively our information systems and data integrity, we could have operational disruptions, have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have customer and physician and other health care provider disputes, have regulatory problems, have increases in operating expenses, lose existing customers, have difficulty in attracting new customers, or suffer other adverse consequences. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences. We depend on independent third parties for significant portions of our systems-related support, equipment, facilities, and certain data, including data center operations, data network, voice communication services and pharmacy data processing. This dependence makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to perform adequately under the contract, due to internal or external factors. A change in service providers could result in a decline in service quality and effectiveness or less favorable contract terms which could adversely affect our operating results. We rely on our agreements with customers, confidentiality agreements with employees, and our trade secrets and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights. These legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. In addition, substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry. We expect software products to be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this area grows. There can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems, developing new systems to support our operations, integrating new systems, protecting our proprietary information, and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future. Failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial positions, results of operations and cash flows. If we fail to manage prescription drug costs successfully, our financial results could suffer. In general, prescription drug costs have been rapidly rising over the past few years. These increases are due to the introduction of new drugs costing significantly more than existing drugs, direct to consumer advertising by the pharmaceutical industry that creates consumer demand for particular brand-name drugs, and members seeking medications to address lifestyle changes. In order to control prescription drug costs, we have implemented multi-tiered copayment benefit designs for prescription drugs, including our four-tiered copayment benefit design, Rx4 and an Rx allowance program organized by evidence based impact. We cannot assure that these efforts will be successful in controlling costs. Failure to control these costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 51 Table of Contents We are involved in various legal actions, which, if resolved unfavorably to us, could result in substantial monetary damages. We are a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business, including employment and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, and tort claims. We, together with some of our competitors in the health benefits business are defendants in a number of purported class action lawsuits. These include an action originally filed against us and nine of our competitors that purports to be brought on behalf of health care providers. Two companies have now settled this action. This suit alleges breaches of federal statutes, including ERISA and RICO. Depending upon the outcome of these cases, these lawsuits may cause or force changes in the practices of the managed care industry. In addition, because of the nature of the health care business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations, including the design, management and offering of products and services. These include and could include in the future: • claims relating to the methodologies for calculating premiums; • claims relating to the denial of health care benefits; • challenges to the use of some software products used in administering claims; • medical malpractice actions based on our medical necessity decisions or brought against us on the theory that we are liable for our providers’ alleged malpractice; • allegations of anti-competitive and unfair business activities; • provider disputes over compensation and termination of provider contracts; • disputes related to self-funded business, including actions alleging claim administration errors; • claims related to the failure to disclose some business practices; and • claims relating to customer audits and contract performance. In some cases, substantial non-economic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal False Claims Act, RICO and other statutes may be sought. While we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities, other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded. Additionally, the cost of business insurance coverage has increased significantly. As a result, we have increased the amount of risk that we self-insure, particularly with respect to matters incidental to our business. We believe that we are adequately insured for claims in excess of our self-insurance. However, some types of damages, like punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance, particularly in those jurisdictions in which coverage of punitive damages is prohibited. Insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future. A description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under “Legal Proceedings” in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. We cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty, and we are incurring expenses in the defense of these matters. Therefore, these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. As a government contractor, we are exposed to additional risks that could adversely affect our business or our willingness to participate in government health care programs. A significant portion of our revenues relates to federal and state government health care coverage programs, including the TRICARE, Medicare Advantage, and Medicaid programs. These programs involve various risks, including: • At December 31, 2004, under one of our contracts with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 231,700 members in Florida. This contract accounted for approximately 15% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the 52 Table of Contents year ended December 31, 2004. The loss of this and other CMS contracts or significant changes in the Medicare Advantage program as a result of legislative or administrative action, including reductions in payments to us or increases in benefits to members without corresponding increases in payments, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; • At December 31, 2004, our TRICARE business, which accounted for approximately 17% of our total premiums and ASO fees during 2004, consisted of the South Region contract. The South Region contract is a five-year contract, subject to annual renewals at the Government’s option that covers approximately 2.9 million beneficiaries. This contract also is generally subject to frequent change from events and circumstances such as the escalated conflict in the Middle East. These changes may include a reduction or increase in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll, in the revenue we receive or in our administrative or health care costs. In the event government reimbursements were to decline from projected amounts, our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business. The loss of our current TRICARE contract would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows; • At December 31, 2004, under our contract with the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration, we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 396,600 Medicaid members in Puerto Rico. This contract, which expires June 30, 2005 accounted for approximately 3% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2004. Due to the election of a new governor and a new Commissioner of Insurance in Puerto Rico, the renewal of the Medicaid contract is uncertain. At this time we are unable to predict the outcome. The loss of this contract or significant changes in the Puerto Rico Medicaid program as a result of legislative or administrative action, including reductions in payments to us or increases in benefits to members without corresponding increases in payments, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; • changes to these government programs in the future may also affect our ability or willingness to participate in these programs; • higher comparative medical costs; • government regulatory and reporting requirements; • higher marketing and advertising costs per member as a result of marketing to individuals as opposed to groups; and • the possibility of temporary or permanent suspension from participating in government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, if we are convicted of fraud or other criminal conduct in the performance of a health care program or if there is an adverse decision against us under the federal False Claims Act. Our industry is currently subject to substantial government regulation, which, along with possible increased governmental regulation or legislative reform, increases our costs of doing business and could adversely affect our profitability. The health care industry in general, and health insurance, particularly health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, and preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation, including: • regulation relating to minimum net worth; • licensing requirements; • approval of policy language and benefits; • mandated benefits and processes; • provider compensation arrangements; 53 Table of Contents • member disclosure; • approval of entry, withdrawal or re-entry into a state or market; • premium rates; and • periodic examinations by state and federal agencies. State regulations require our licensed, operating subsidiaries to maintain minimum net worth requirements and restrict some investment activities. Additionally, those regulations restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividend payments, loans, loan repayments or other payments to us. In recent years, significant federal and state legislation affecting our business has been enacted. State and federal governmental authorities are continually considering changes to laws and regulations applicable to us and are currently considering regulations relating to: • mandatory benefits and products; • rules tightening time periods in which claims must be paid; • medical malpractice reform; • defining medical necessity; • health insurance access; • provider compensation and contract language; • disclosure of provider fee schedules and other data about payments to providers, sometimes called transparency; • product flexibility and use of innovative technology; • disclosure of provider quality information; • health plan liability to members who fail to receive appropriate care; • disclosure and composition of physician networks; • formation of regional/national association health plans for small employers; • adding further restrictions and administrative requirements on the use, retention, transmission, processing, production and disclosure of personally identifiable health information; • physicians’ ability to collectively negotiate contract terms with carriers, including fees; and • mental health parity. All of these proposals could apply to us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses or that legislative or regulatory change will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals could adversely affect our revenue or the number of our members, increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, has adopted risk-based capital requirements, also known as RBC, which is subject to state-by-state adoption and to the extent implemented, sets minimum capitalization requirements for insurance and HMO companies. The NAIC recommendations for life insurance companies were adopted in all states and the prescribed calculation for HMOs has been adopted in most states in which we operate. The HMO rules may increase the minimum capital required for some of our subsidiaries. The use of individually identifiable data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels. These laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation. Various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data. Most are derived from the privacy provisions in the 54 Table of Contents federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. HIPAA includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions, establishing uniform health care provider, payer, and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data. Regulations issued in February 2003 set standards for the security of electronic health information requiring compliance by April 21, 2005. Violations of these rules will subject us to significant penalties. Compliance with HIPAA regulations requires significant systems enhancements, training and administrative effort. The final rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws, but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent. HIPAA could also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates. Another area receiving increased focus is the time in which various laws require the payment of health care claims. Many states already have legislation in place covering payment of claims within a specific number of days. However, due to provider groups advocating for laws or regulations establishing even stricter standards, procedures and penalties, we expect additional regulatory scrutiny and supplemental legislation with respect to claims payment practices. The provider-sponsored bills are characterized by stiff penalties for late payment, including high interest rates payable to providers and costly fines levied by state insurance departments and attorneys general. This legislation and possible future regulation and oversight could expose our Company to additional liability and penalties. We are also subject to various governmental audits and investigations. These can include audits and investigations by state attorneys general, CMS, the Office of the Inspector General of Health and Human Services, the Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, the Defense Contract Audit Agency, and state Departments of Insurance and Departments of Health. Several Attorneys General are currently investigating the practices of insurance brokers, including those of certain of the companies in the health care industry. All of these activities could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in various programs, or the imposition of fines, penalties and other sanctions. In addition, disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our industry or our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services. If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members, our business could be adversely affected. We contract with physicians, hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members. Our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers. These providers may share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a cost-effective manner. In any particular market, providers could refuse to contract with us, demand to contract with us, demand higher payments, or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us, less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, some providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions and negotiating power. In addition, physician or practice management companies, which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage, may, in some cases, compete directly with us. If these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected. In some situations, we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care physicians for an actuarially determined, fixed, per-member-per-month fee under which physicians are paid an amount to provide all required medical services to our members (i.e. capitation). The inability of providers to properly manage costs under these capitation arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship with us. In addition, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with 55 Table of Contents whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. The financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us, even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider. There can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations. Our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted. Because we operate as a holding company, we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of Humana Inc., the parent company. These subsidiaries generally are regulated by states’ Departments of Insurance. In most states, we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts, or, in some states, any amount. In addition, we normally notify the state Departments of Insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval. We are also required by law to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries. Debt ratings are an important factor in our competitive position. Claims paying ability, financial strength, and debt ratings by recognized rating organizations have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. We believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to certain of our customers, and our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings. Each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future. Our ratings reflect each rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders, but are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in our common stock and should not be relied upon as such. Downgrades in our ratings, should they occur, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business. The health benefits industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry. This publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation, including some large jury awards, legislative activity, regulation and governmental review of industry practices. These factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services, may require us to change our products or services, may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines. Any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. ITEM 7a.

49071,HUM,HUMANA INC,2012,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the section titled “Health Insurance Reform.” 2011 Business Segment Realignment During the first quarter of 2011, we realigned our business segments to reflect our evolving business model. As a result, we reassessed and changed our operating and reportable segments in the first quarter of 2011 to reflect management’s view of the business and to align our external financial reporting with our new operating and internal financial reporting model. Historical segment information has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effect of this change. Our new reportable segments and the basis for determining those segments are discussed below. Business Segments We currently manage our business with three reportable segments: Retail, Employer Group, and Health and Well-Being Services. In addition, we include businesses that are not individually reportable because they do not meet the quantitative thresholds required by generally accepted accounting principles in an Other Businesses category. These segments are based on a combination of the type of health plan customer and adjacent businesses centered on well-being solutions for our health plans and other customers, as described below. These segment groupings are consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer to assess performance and allocate resources. The Retail segment consists of Medicare and commercial fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health and financial protection products, marketed directly to individuals. The Employer Group segment consists of Medicare and commercial fully-insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health and financial protection products, as well as administrative services only products marketed to employer groups. The Health and Well-Being Services segment includes services offered to our health plan members as well as to third parties that promote health and wellness, including primary care, pharmacy, integrated wellness, and home care services. The Other Businesses category consists of our Military services, primarily our TRICARE South Region contract, Medicaid, and closed-block long-term care businesses as well as our contract with CMS to administer the Limited Income Newly Eligible Transition program, or the LI-NET program. The results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes. Transactions between reportable segments consist of sales of services rendered by our Health and Well-Being Services segment, primarily pharmacy and behavioral health services, to our Retail and Employer Group customers. Intersegment sales and expenses are recorded at fair value and eliminated in consolidation. Members served by our segments often utilize the same provider networks, enabling us in some instances to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share indirect costs and assets. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. We allocate most operating expenses to our segments. Assets and certain corporate income and expenses are not allocated to the segments, including the portion of investment income not supporting segment operations, interest expense on corporate debt, and certain other corporate expenses. These items are managed at the corporate level. These corporate amounts are reported separately from our reportable segments and included with intersegment eliminations. 4 Table of Contents Our Products Our medical and specialty insurance products allow members to access health care services primarily through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted. These products may vary in the degree to which members have coverage. Health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, generally require a referral from the member’s primary care physician before seeing certain specialty physicians. Preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, provide members the freedom to choose a health care provider without requiring a referral. However PPOs generally require the member to pay a greater portion of the provider’s fee in the event the member chooses not to use a provider participating in the PPO’s network. Point of Service, or POS, plans combine the advantages of HMO plans with the flexibility of PPO plans. In general, POS plans allow members to choose, at the time medical services are needed, to seek care from a provider within the plan’s network or outside the network. In addition, we offer services to our health plan members as well as to third parties that promote health and wellness, including pharmacy, primary care, integrated wellness, and home care services. The discussion that follows describes the products offered by each of our segments. Our Retail Segment Products This segment is comprised of products sold on a retail basis to individuals including medical and supplemental benefit plans described in the discussion that follows. The following table presents our premiums and services revenue for the Retail segment by product for the year ended December 31, 2011: Retail SegmentPremiums andServices Revenue Percent ofConsolidatedPremiums andServices Revenue (dollars in millions) Premiums: Individual Medicare Advantage $ 18,100 49.6 % Individual Medicare stand-alone PDP 2,317 6.4 % Total individual Medicare 20,417 56.0 % Individual commercial 861 2.4 % Individual specialty 124 0.3 % Total premiums 21,402 58.7 % Services 16 0.0 % Total premiums and services revenue $ 21,418 58.7 % Individual Medicare We have participated in the Medicare program for private health plans for over 25 years and have established a national presence, offering at least one type of Medicare plan in all 50 states. We have a geographically diverse membership base that provides us with greater ability to expand our network of PPO and HMO providers. We employ strategies including health assessments and clinical guidance programs such as lifestyle and fitness programs for seniors to guide Medicare beneficiaries in making cost-effective decisions with respect to their health care. We believe these strategies result in cost savings that occur from making positive behavior changes. Medicare is a federal program that provides persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons under the age of 65 certain hospital and medical insurance benefits. CMS, an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, administers the Medicare program. Hospitalization benefits are provided under Part A, without the payment of any premium, for up to 90 days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating 60 days. Eligible beneficiaries are required to pay an annually adjusted premium to the federal government to be eligible for physician care and other services under Part B. Beneficiaries eligible for Part A and 5 Table of Contents Part B coverage under original Medicare are still required to pay out-of-pocket deductibles and coinsurance. Throughout this document this program is referred to as original Medicare. As an alternative to original Medicare, in geographic areas where a managed care organization has contracted with CMS pursuant to the Medicare Advantage program, Medicare beneficiaries may choose to receive benefits from a Medicare Advantage organization under Medicare Part C. Pursuant to Medicare Part C, Medicare Advantage organizations contract with CMS to offer Medicare Advantage plans to provide benefits at least comparable to those offered under original Medicare. Our Medicare Advantage plans are discussed more fully below. Prescription drug benefits are provided under Part D. Individual Medicare Advantage Products We contract with CMS under the Medicare Advantage program to provide a comprehensive array of health insurance benefits, including wellness programs, to Medicare eligible persons under HMO, PPO, and Private Fee-For-Service, or PFFS, plans in exchange for contractual payments received from CMS, usually a fixed payment per member per month. With each of these products, the beneficiary receives benefits in excess of original Medicare, typically including reduced cost sharing, enhanced prescription drug benefits, care coordination, data analysis techniques to help identify member needs, complex case management, tools to guide members in their health care decisions, disease management programs, wellness and prevention programs and, in some instances, a reduced monthly Part B premium. Most Medicare Advantage plans offer the prescription drug benefit under Part D as part of the basic plan, subject to cost sharing and other limitations. Accordingly, all of the provisions of the Medicare Part D program described in connection with our stand-alone prescription drug plans in the following section also are applicable to most of our Medicare Advantage plans. Medicare Advantage plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for Medicare-covered services or for certain extra benefits. Generally, Medicare-eligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between October 15 and December 7 for coverage that begins on January 1. Our Medicare HMO and PPO plans, which cover Medicare-eligible individuals residing in certain counties, may eliminate or reduce coinsurance or the level of deductibles on many other medical services while seeking care from participating in-network providers or in emergency situations. Except in emergency situations, HMO plans provide no out-of-network benefits. PPO plans carry an out-of network benefit that is subject to higher member cost-sharing. In most cases, these beneficiaries are required to pay a monthly premium to the HMO or PPO plan in addition to the monthly Part B premium they are required to pay the Medicare program. Our Medicare PFFS plans generally have no preferred network. Individuals in these plans pay us a monthly premium to receive typical Medicare Advantage benefits along with the freedom to choose any health care provider that accepts individuals at rates equivalent to original Medicare payment rates. On January 1, 2011, most of our members enrolled in PFFS plans transitioned to networked-based PPO type products due to a requirement that Medicare Advantage organizations establish adequate provider networks, except in geographic areas that CMS determines have fewer than two network-based Medicare Advantage plans. CMS uses monthly rates per person for each county to determine the fixed monthly payments per member to pay to health benefit plans. These rates are adjusted under CMS’s risk-adjustment model which uses health status indicators, or risk scores, to improve the accuracy of payment. The risk-adjustment model, which CMS implemented pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and the Benefits and Improvement Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA), generally pays more for members with predictably higher costs and uses principal hospital inpatient diagnoses as well as diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings (hospital outpatient department and physician visits) to establish the risk-adjustment payments. Under the risk-adjustment methodology, all health benefit organizations must collect from providers and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to CMS within prescribed deadlines. At December 31, 2011, we provided health insurance coverage under CMS contracts to approximately 1,640,300 individual Medicare Advantage members. Under our individual Medicare Advantage contracts with CMS in Florida, we provided health insurance coverage to approximately 362,100 members. These Florida 6 Table of Contents contracts accounted for premiums revenue of approximately $5.6 billion, which represented approximately 31% of our individual Medicare Advantage premiums revenue, or 15% of our consolidated premiums and services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011. Our HMO, PPO, and PFFS products covered under Medicare Advantage contracts with CMS are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless CMS notifies us of its decision not to renew by August 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end, or we notify CMS of our decision not to renew by the first Monday in June of the calendar year in which the contract would end. All material contracts between Humana and CMS relating to our Medicare Advantage products have been renewed for 2012, and all of our product offerings filed with CMS for 2012 have been approved. Individual Medicare Stand-Alone Prescription Drug Products We offer stand-alone prescription drug plans, or PDPs, under Medicare Part D. Generally, Medicare-eligible individuals enroll in one of our plan choices between October 15 and December 7 for coverage that begins on January 1. Our stand-alone PDP offerings consist of plans offering basic coverage with benefits mandated by Congress, as well as plans providing enhanced coverage with varying degrees of out-of-pocket costs for premiums, deductibles, and co-insurance. In October 2010, we announced the lowest premium national stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan co-branded with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., the Humana Walmart-Preferred Rx Plan. This plan was first offered for the 2011 plan year. Our revenues from CMS and the beneficiary are determined from our bids submitted annually to CMS. These revenues also reflect the health status of the beneficiary and risk sharing provisions as more fully described in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the section titled “Medicare Part D Provisions.” Our stand-alone PDP contracts with CMS are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless CMS notifies us of its decision not to renew by August 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end, or we notify CMS of our decision not to renew by the first Monday in June of the calendar year in which the contract would end. All material contracts between Humana and CMS relating to our Medicare stand-alone PDP products have been renewed for 2012, and all of our product offerings filed with CMS for 2012 have been approved. Medicare and Medicaid Dual Eligible Medicare beneficiaries who also qualify for Medicaid due to low income or special needs are known as dual eligible beneficiaries, or dual eligibles. There were approximately 9 million dual eligible enrollees in 2011. These dual eligibles may enroll in a privately-offered Medicare Advantage product, but may also receive assistance from Medicaid for Medicaid benefits, such as nursing home care and/or assistance with Medicare premiums and cost sharing. As of December 31, 2011, we served approximately 242,000 dual eligible members in our Medicare Advantage plans and approximately 482,000 dual eligible members in our stand-alone prescription drug plans. Individual Commercial Coverage Our individual health plans, marketed under the HumanaOne® brand include offerings designed to promote wellness and engage consumers. HumanaOne plans are designed specifically for self-employed entrepreneurs, small-business employees, part-time workers, students, and early retirees and include a broad spectrum of major medical benefits with multiple in-network coinsurance levels and annual deductible choices, as well as HumanaVitality®, our wellness and loyalty rewards program. Our HumanaOne plans primarily are offered as PPO plans in select markets where we can generally underwrite risk and utilize our existing networks and distribution channels. This individual product includes provisions mandated by law to guarantee renewal of coverage for as long as the individual chooses. The HumanaOne plans can be further customized with optional benefits such as dental, vision, life, and a broad portfolio of financial protection products. 7 Table of Contents Our Employer Group Segment Products This segment is comprised of products sold to employer groups including medical and supplemental benefit plans described in the discussion that follows. The following table presents our premiums and services revenue for the Employer Group segment by product for the year ended December 31, 2011: Employer GroupSegmentPremiums andServices Revenue Percent ofConsolidatedPremiums andServices Revenue (dollars in millions) Premiums: Fully-insured commercial group $ 4,782 13.1 % Group Medicare Advantage 3,152 8.6 % Group Medicare stand-alone PDP 8 0.0 % Total group Medicare 3,160 8.6 % Group specialty 935 2.6 % Total premiums 8,877 24.3 % Services 356 1.0 % Total premiums and services revenue $ 9,233 25.3 % Employer Group Commercial Coverage Our commercial products sold to employer groups include a broad spectrum of major medical benefits with multiple in-network coinsurance levels and annual deductible choices that employers of all sizes can offer to their employees on either a fully-insured, through HMO, PPO, or POS plans, or self-funded basis. Our plans integrate clinical programs, plan designs, communication tools, and spending accounts. We participate in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, or FEHBP, primarily with our HMO offering in certain markets. FEHBP is the government’s health insurance program for Federal employees, retirees, former employees, family members, and spouses. As with our individual commercial products, the employer group offerings include HumanaVitality’s wellness offerings. Our administrative services only, or ASO, products are offered to employers who self-insure their employee health plans. We receive fees to provide administrative services which generally include the processing of claims, offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs, and responding to customer service inquiries from members of self-funded employers. These products may include all of the same benefit and product design characteristics of our fully-insured HMO, PPO, or POS products described previously. Under ASO contracts, self-funded employers retain the risk of financing substantially all of the cost of health benefits. However, more than half of our ASO customers purchase stop loss insurance coverage from us to cover catastrophic claims or to limit aggregate annual costs. As with individual commercial policies, employers can customize their offerings with optional benefits such as dental, vision, life, and a broad portfolio of financial protection products. Group Medicare Advantage and Medicare stand-alone PDP We offer products that enable employers that provide post-retirement health care benefits to replace Medicare wrap or Medicare supplement products with Medicare Advantage or stand-alone PDPs from Humana. These products offer the same types of benefits and services available to members in our individual Medicare plans discussed previously and can be tailored to closely match an employer’s post-retirement benefit structure. 8 Table of Contents Our Health and Well-Being Services Segment Products This segment is comprised of stand-alone businesses that promote health and well-being. These services are sold primarily to other Humana businesses, as well as external health plan members and other employers or individuals and are described in the discussion that follows.

Our approach to primary, physician-directed care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent, integrated, cost-effective, and member-focused. The model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole, while offering our members a simple, seamless healthcare experience.

These Florida contracts accounted for premiums revenue of approximately $5.9 billion, which represented approximately 28% of our individual Medicare Advantage premiums revenue, or 15% of our consolidated premiums and services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012. Our HMO and PPO products covered under Medicare Advantage contracts with CMS are renewed generally for a calendar year term unless CMS notifies us of its decision not to renew by August 1 of the calendar year in which the contract would end, or we notify CMS of our decision not to renew by the first Monday in June of the calendar year in which the contract would end.

We receive fees to provide administrative services which generally include the processing of claims, offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs, and responding to customer service inquiries from members of self-funded employers. These products may include all of the same benefit and product design characteristics of our fully-insured HMO, PPO, or POS products described previously. Under ASO contracts, self-funded employers generally retain the risk of financing substantially all of the cost of health benefits. However, more than half of our ASO customers purchase stop loss insurance coverage from us to cover catastrophic claims or to limit aggregate annual costs. As with individual commercial policies, employers can customize their offerings with optional benefits such as dental, vision, life, and a broad portfolio of financial protection products. Group Medicare Advantage and Medicare stand-alone PDP We offer products that enable employers that provide post-retirement health care benefits to replace Medicare wrap or Medicare supplement products with Medicare Advantage or stand-alone PDPs from Humana. These products offer the same types of benefits and services available to members in our individual Medicare plans discussed previously and can be tailored to closely match an employer’s post-retirement benefit structure. 8 Table of Contents Our Health and Well-Being Services Segment Products This segment is comprised of stand-alone businesses that promote health and well-being.
