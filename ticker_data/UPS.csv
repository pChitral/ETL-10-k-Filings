1090727,UPS,UNITED PARCEL SERVICE INC,2001,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Operations 2000 Compared to 1999 The following tables set forth information showing the change in revenue, average daily package volume and average revenue per piece, both in dollars or amounts and in percentage terms: Year Ended December 31, Change Revenue 2000 1999 $ % (In millions) U.S. domestic package: Next Day Air $ 5,664 $ 5,240 $ 424 8.1 % Deferred 2,910 2,694 216 8.0 Ground 15,428 14,379 1,049 7.3 Total U.S. domestic package 24,002 22,313 1,689 7.6 International package: Domestic 904 924 (20 ) (2.2 ) Export 2,837 2,479 358 14.4 Cargo 425 327 98 30.0 Total international package 4,166 3,730 436 11.7 Non-package: UPS Logistics Group 1,021 771 250 32.4 Other 582 238 344 144.5 Total non-package 1,603 1,009 594 58.9 Consolidated $ 29,771 $ 27,052 $ 2,719 10.1 % Average Daily Package Volume: # (In thousands) U.S. domestic package: Next Day Air 1,122 1,039 83 8.0 % Deferred 914 852 62 7.3 Ground 10,434 10,016 418 4.2 Total U.S. domestic package 12,470 11,907 563 4.7 International package: Domestic 786 711 75 10.5 Export 368 303 65 21.5 Total international package 1,154 1,014 140 13.8 Consolidated 13,624 12,921 703 5.4 % Average Revenue Per Piece: $ U.S. domestic package: Next Day Air $ 19.87 $ 19.86 $ 0.01 0.1 % Deferred 12.53 12.45 0.08 0.6 Ground 5.82 5.65 0.17 3.0 Total U.S. domestic package 7.58 7.38 0.20 2.7 International package: Domestic 4.53 5.12 (0.59 ) (11.5 ) Export 30.35 32.21 (1.86 ) (5.8 ) Total international package 12.76 13.21 (0.45 ) (3.4 ) Consolidated $ 8.02 $ 7.84 $ 0.18 2.3 % 22 U.S. domestic package revenue increased almost $1.7 billion, or 7.6%, primarily due to volume gains across all product lines, combined with a 2.7% increase in average revenue per piece, which was primarily driven by our Ground products. All products contributed to the revenue increase, with our higher revenue per piece express (Next Day Air and Deferred) products increasing at approximately the same rate (8.1% and 8.0% respectively). Our average daily Ground volume grew at a 4.2% rate for the period, helping to bring our total U.S. average daily package volume to almost 12.5 million pieces. During the first quarter of 2000, we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 3.1% for commercial deliveries. The ground residential charge continued to be $1.00 over the commercial ground rate, with an additional delivery area surcharge of $1.50 added to certain less accessible areas. In addition, we increased rates for UPS Next Day Air, UPS Next Day Air Saver and UPS 2nd Day Air an average of 3.5%. The surcharge for UPS Next Day Air Early A.M. did not change. Rates for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service) increased by 2.9%. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. were made throughout the past year and varied by geographic market. The increase in international package revenue was due to double-digit volume growth for both our domestic and export products, offset by a decline in the revenue per piece for these products. This decline was primarily due to a decline in the value of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar that occurred during 2000. The value of the Euro averaged $0.92 in 2000 compared to $1.07 in 1999. Overall average daily package volume increased 13.8% for international operations, with our export products, which had an average revenue per piece in excess of $30, increasing at 21.5%. The increase in non-package revenue resulted primarily from the new arrangement for providing excess value package insurance for our customers as well as continued growth of the UPS Logistics Group. Revenue for the UPS Logistics Group increased by $250 million, or 32.4%, to over $1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2000. The new arrangement for providing excess value package insurance began in the fourth quarter of 1999. Consequently, this item will have a reduced impact on the comparability of the revenue for our non-package segment in future periods. Operating expenses increased by $2.112 billion, or 9.1%, which was less than our revenue increase of 10.1%. Compensation and benefits expenses, the largest component of this increase, accounted for $1.261 billion of the increase and included a $59 million charge recorded in the first quarter of 2000 relating to the creation of 4,000 new full-time hourly jobs resulting from the 1997 Teamsters contract. Other operating expenses increased $851 million primarily due to higher purchased transportation costs, higher fuel costs and claims expense associated with the new arrangement for providing excess value package insurance for our customers. The increase in purchased transportation costs was primarily due to increased business for our international and logistics operations. The 40.1% increase in fuel costs from $681 million to $954 million was due to the increase in fuel prices during 2000 and the additional fuel usage due to the growth in our average daily package volume, partially offset by cost reductions generated by our fuel hedging program. The increase in other operating expenses of $219 million was slightly offset by the $49 million gain we recognized in the first quarter of 2000 from the sale of our UPS Truck Leasing subsidiary. International operating expenses were favorably impacted by the decline in the value of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar as discussed above. To offset the increasing fuel costs we have experienced over the last several quarters and that we expect to continue into the near future, we implemented a temporary 1.25% fuel surcharge effective August 7, 2000. Approximately $130 million in revenue was recorded in 2000 as a result of the surcharge. Our operating margin, defined as operating profit as a percentage of revenue, improved from 14.4% during 1999 to 15.2% during 2000. This improvement continues our recently reported trends and was favorably impacted by continued product mix improvements and our continued successful efforts in obtaining profitable volume growth. 23 The following table shows the change in operating profit, both in dollars and in percentage terms: Year Ended December 31, Change Operating Segment 2000 1999 $ % (In millions) U.S. domestic package $ 3,929 $ 3,506 $ 423 12.1 % International package 274 232 42 18.1 Non-package 309 167 142 85.0 Consolidated operating profit $ 4,512 $ 3,905 $ 607 15.5 % U.S. domestic package operating profit increased by $423 million, or 12.1%, due to the volume and revenue improvements discussed previously. The improvement in the operating profit of our international package segment of 18.1%, or $42 million, resulted primarily from increased volume and revenue, and was realized despite significantly higher fuel costs. This improvement occurred throughout our international regions. The improvement in operating profit for this segment would have been $36 million greater, if the impact of currency fluctuations was excluded. The increase in non-package operating profit is largely due to the new arrangement for providing excess value package insurance for our customers, which contributed $183 million of additional operating profit for the year. Also contributing to the operating profit improvement was the $49 million gain we recognized during the first quarter of 2000 from the sale of our UPS Truck Leasing subsidiary. These improvements were offset somewhat by start-up costs associated with UPS Logistics Group’s service parts logistics offering, UPS e-Ventures, UPS Capital Corporation and other initiatives. The increase in investment income of $330 million for the period is primarily due to two factors. First, in the first quarter of 2000, two companies in which our Strategic Enterprise Fund held investments were acquired by other companies, which caused us to recognize a gain of $241 million. Second, we earned income on the $5.3 billion in net IPO proceeds available for investment prior to the tender offer that was completed in early March 2000 and the $1.2 billion in IPO proceeds that were not utilized for the tender offer. In 1999, we had the net IPO proceeds available for investment from mid-November through the end of the year. We announced a share repurchase program on April 20, 2000 under which we would utilize up to the remaining $1.2 billion not used in the tender offer. As of December 31, 2000, approximately $105 million remained available for share repurchases. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $2.934 billion, or $2.50 per diluted share, compared to net income of $883 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, for the prior year. Our 2000 results reflect the non-recurring items discussed above, which include the gains on our Strategic Enterprise Fund investments and the sale of our UPS Truck Leasing subsidiary, offset partially by the charge for retroactive costs associated with creating new full-time jobs from existing part-time Teamster jobs. Our 1999 results reflect a tax assessment charge resulting from an unfavorable ruling of the U.S. Tax Court. Excluding these non-recurring transactions for each of these years, adjusted net income for 2000 would have been $2.795 billion, an increase in excess of 20% over adjusted 1999 net income of $2.325 billion. Adjusted diluted earnings per share would have increased from $2.04 in 1999 to $2.38 in 2000 Our fourth quarter 2000 results reflected a decline in our previously reported growth rates for both revenue and average daily volume. These declines were caused by an overall weakening of the economy. 24 1999 Compared to 1998 The following tables set forth information showing the change in revenue, average daily package volume and average revenue per piece, both in dollars or amounts and in percentage terms: Year Ended December 31, Change Revenue: 1999 1998 $ % (In millions) U.S. domestic package: Next Day Air $ 5,240 $ 4,690 550 11.7 % Deferred 2,694 2,464 230 9.3 Ground 14,379 13,496 883 6.5 Total U.S. domestic package 22,313 20,650 1,663 8.1 International package: Domestic 924 953 (29 ) (3.0 ) Export 2,479 2,176 303 13.9 Cargo 327 270 57 21.1 Total international package 3,730 3,399 331 9.7 Non-package UPS Logistics Group 771 631 140 22.2 Other 238 108 130 120.4 Total non-package 1,009 739 270 36.5 Consolidated $ 27,052 $ 24,788 $ 2,264 9.1 % Average Daily Package Volume: # (In thousands) U.S. domestic package: Next Day Air 1,039 938 101 10.8 % Deferred 852 783 69 8.8 Ground 10,016 9,645 371 3.8 Total U.S. domestic package 11,907 11,366 541 4.8 International package: Domestic 711 730 (19 ) (2.6 ) Export 303 256 47 18.4 Total international package 1,014 986 28 2.8 Consolidated 12,921 12,352 569 4.6 % Average Revenue Per Piece: $ U.S. domestic package: Next Day Air $ 19.86 $ 19.69 $ 0.17 0.9 % Deferred 12.45 12.39 0.06 0.5 Ground 5.65 5.51 0.14 2.5 Total U.S. domestic package 7.38 7.15 0.23 3.2 International package: Domestic 5.12 5.14 (0.02 ) (0.4 ) Export 32.21 33.46 (1.25 ) (3.7 ) Total international package 13.21 12.49 0.72 5.8 Consolidated $ 7.84 $ 7.58 $ 0.26 3.4 % 25 U.S. domestic package revenue increased more than $1.6 billion primarily due to a 4.8% increase in average daily package volume combined with a 3.2% improvement in revenue per piece. Package volume growth was experienced in all products, with average volumes for our Next Day Air and Deferred products growing at 10.8% and 8.8%, respectively. We generated substantial growth in our Ground revenue, which comprised 64% of our U.S. domestic package revenue, based on average volume growth of 3.8% and a 2.5% improvement in average revenue per piece. During the first quarter of 1999, we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 2.5% for commercial deliveries. The ground residential charge continued to be $1.00 over the commercial ground rate, with an additional delivery area surcharge added to certain less accessible areas. In addition, we increased rates for UPS Next Day Air, UPS Next Day Air Saver and UPS 2nd Day Air an average of 2.5%, while we decreased the rate for UPS 2nd Day Air A.M. by 2.2%. The rate for UPS Next Day Air Early A.M. did not change. Rates for international shipments originating in the United States did not increase for UPS Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. were made throughout the past year and varied by geographic market. The increase in international package revenue was primarily due to an overall improvement in product mix, specifically volume growth for our export products. All international operations posted double-digit volume growth in export services, with the largest increases experienced in our Asia Pacific and European operations. Due to the strong growth of our international export products, our total average revenue per piece for the international segment increased $0.72, or 5.8%. The growth in non-package revenue resulted primarily from the continued growth of the UPS Logistics Group. This growth reflects both new business and increased business with existing customers. Revenue for the non-package segment was also increased by the new arrangement for providing excess value package insurance for our customers, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 1999. Operating expenses increased by $1.366 billion, or 6.3%, which was less than our increase in revenue of 9.1%. Compensation and benefit expenses accounted for $939 million of this increase. Purchased transportation costs increased by $160 million and fuel costs increased by $77 million. The operating margin for 1999 was 14.4% compared to 12.1% in 1998. This improvement was largely due to containment of operating expense growth through better utilization of existing capacity and from continued company-wide cost containment efforts. The following table shows the change in operating profit, both in dollars and in percentage terms: Year Ended December 31, Change Operating Segment 1999 1998 $ % (In millions) U.S. domestic package $ 3,506 $ 2,815 $ 691 24.5% International package 232 29 203 700.0 Non-package 167 159 8 5.0 Consolidated Operating Profit $ 3,905 $ 3,003 $ 902 30.0% U.S. domestic package operating profit improved due to the volume and revenue improvements discussed previously, combined with the containment of operating expense growth. Our international package operating profit improved significantly in 1999 due to a shift to higher yielding export packages. Average daily volume for our export products grew 18.4% over 1998. The Europe and Asia Pacific regions contributed significantly to overall operating profit improvements. The increase in non-package operating profit was largely due to the new arrangement for providing excess value package insurance for our customers. The new arrangement for excess value package insurance, which was implemented in the fourth quarter of 1999, increased non-package operating profit by $60 million. This increase was offset by continued start-up costs at UPS Capital Corporation, higher third party underwriting losses for UPINSCO, our captive insurance company, and a reduction in intersegment profit. The UPS 26 Logistics Group experienced a small decrease in operating profit compared to last year. This decrease was due to third-party transportation costs for the group’s service parts logistics offering and higher fuel costs for its UPS Truck Leasing subsidiary. These decreases were offset somewhat by higher operating profits for the group’s supply chain management offering. The increase in investment income of $93 million for the year was due to large cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and short-term investments balances we have maintained during 1999, including the IPO proceeds received in November. Net income for 1999 decreased by $858 million from 1998, resulting in a decrease in diluted earnings per share from $1.57 in 1998 to $0.77 in 1999. These results reflect the charge we recorded during the second quarter of 1999, resulting from an unfavorable ruling of the U.S. Tax Court. Excluding the impact of this one-time charge of $1.442 billion, our adjusted net income for 1999 would have been $2.325 billion, with an associated adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.04. Further discussion of this matter is included in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations. We maintain significant cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and short-term investments, amounting to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2000. Of this amount, approximately $105 million represents the net proceeds remaining from our initial public offering, which was completed in November 1999. In November 1999, we received net proceeds of $5.266 billion from our initial public offering. We used the majority of the IPO proceeds to fund a cash tender offer to purchase Class A-1 shares from shareowners. The remaining IPO proceeds of approximately $105 million as of December 31, 2000 were available for a share repurchase program that was announced on April 20, 2000. In addition, an additional $750 million has been authorized for share repurchases. We maintain two commercial paper programs under which we are authorized to borrow up to $7.0 billion. Approximately $1.366 billion was outstanding under these programs as of December 31, 2000. Since we do not intend to refinance the full commercial paper balance outstanding at December 31, 2000, $366 million has been classified as a current liability in our balance sheet. The average interest rate on the amount outstanding at December 31, 2000 was 6.5%. We maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks. These agreements provide revolving credit facilities of $1.25 billion each, with one expiring on April 26, 2001 and the other expiring on April 27, 2005. Interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90-day LIBOR plus 15 basis points. There were no borrowings under either of these agreements as of December 31, 2000. We also maintain a $1.0 billion European medium-term note program. Under this program, we may issue notes from time to time, denominated in a variety of currencies. At December 31, 2000, $1.0 billion was available under this program. The $200 million outstanding at December 31, 2000, which was issued under this program in 1997, bears interest at a stated rate of 6.625%. Subsequent to December 31, 2000, we issued $736 million of 30-year Pound Sterling bonds under this program, which bear interest at a stated rate of 5.50%. We have filed a shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the U.S. of up to $2.0 billion. The debt may be denominated in a variety of currencies. In September 2000, we issued $300 million cash-settled convertible senior notes due September 27, 2007 pursuant to our shelf registration statement. The notes were sold at par with a stated interest rate of 1.75% and are callable after three years. The notes may be exchanged for an amount of cash that is indexed to the trading price of Class B common stock. There was approximately $405 million issued under this shelf registration statement at December 31, 2000. Subsequent to December 31, 2000, we have issued debt under our UPS Notes program. The notes issued under this program have various terms and maturities, all with fixed interest rates. As of February 28, 2001, $57 million has been issued under this program. Also subsequent to December 31, 2000, we issued $89 27 million in floating rate senior notes due December 2050, which bear interest at one-month LIBOR less 45 basis points. On August 9, 1999 the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion unfavorable to UPS regarding a Notice of Deficiency asserting that we are liable for additional tax for the 1983 and 1984 tax years. The Court held that we are liable for tax on income of OPL, which had reinsured excess value package insurance purchased by our customers beginning in 1984. In February 2000, the U.S. Tax Court entered a decision in accord with its opinion. In addition, during the first quarter of 1999, the IRS issued two Notices of Deficiency asserting that we are liable for additional tax for the 1985 through 1987 tax years, and the 1988 through 1990 tax years. The primary assertions by the IRS relate to the reinsurance of excess value package insurance, the issue raised for the 1984 tax year. The IRS has based its assertions on the same theories included in the 1983-1984 Notice of Deficiency. The IRS, in an issued report, has taken similar positions for tax years 1991 through 1994. We expect the IRS to take similar positions for tax years 1995 through 1999. We believe that a number of aspects of the Tax Court decision are incorrect, and we have appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The Eleventh Circuit has heard oral arguments. We do not know when the court will render a decision. We have been named as a defendant in 23 lawsuits that seek to hold us (and in certain cases, other defendants) liable for the collection of premiums for excess value package insurance in connection with package shipments since 1984 (or, in some of the cases, for shorter time periods). The ultimate resolution of these matters cannot presently be determined. In addition, we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business. In our opinion, none of these cases is expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In November 2000, OSHA published its final ergonomics standard, which would have required American industry to take expansive compliance steps in the workplace when employees report musculoskeletal complaints such as low back pain. The rule was subsequently challenged by a broad coalition of trade associations and businesses in actions consolidated in the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. We, our competitors, and other affected parties filed comments with OSHA challenging several aspects of the rule, including the medical support and economic and technical feasibility of the proposed regulations. OSHA took the position that the cost of compliance with the proposed regulations would have been only $4.5 billion per year over a ten-year period for all of American industry. We maintained that these estimates were unrealistic and estimated that the cost of compliance would have been significantly greater, both in initial costs and in incremental annual costs. We estimated that such expenditures, if required to be incurred, would have materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. Subsequent to December 31, 2000, the United States Senate and House of Representatives passed joint resolutions disapproving the OSHA ergonomics standard, and declaring that the standard shall have no force or effect. President Bush has signed into law a repeal of the OSHA ergonomics standard. We anticipate that the legal proceedings described above will be dismissed as moot. Reference is made to Note 4 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for more information on each of the matters (Tax Court decision, lawsuits and OSHA) discussed previously. We believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long-term needs for the operation of our business, including anticipated capital expenditures such as commitments for aircraft purchases through 2009. 28 Following is a summary of capital expenditures: Year Ended December 31, 2000 1999 1998 (In millions) Buildings and facilities $ 947 $ 579 $ 408 Aircraft and parts 645 433 942 Vehicles 156 139 141 Information technology 399 325 154 $ 2,147 $ 1,476 $ 1,645 We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $2.8 billion in 2001. These expenditures will provide for replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth and include the projected cost of capitalized software. Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and certain commodity prices. All of this market risk arises in the normal course of business, as UPS does not engage in speculative trading activities. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we utilize a variety of foreign exchange, interest rate, equity and commodity forward contracts, options, and swaps. A discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to increases in the price of refined fuels, principally jet-A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline, which are all used in our normal business operations. We use a combination of options, swaps, and futures contracts to provide some protection from rising fuel prices. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted fuel consumption for periods up to one year. The net fair value of such contracts, subject to price risk, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 was an asset (liability) of approximately $(5) and $27 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of these derivative contracts, assuming a 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $9 and $12 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, operating costs, and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate. We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. We use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures. As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was a liability of approximately $9 million and none, respectively. The potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $37 million and none for 2000 and 1999, respectively. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates. Exchange rates rarely move in the same direction. The assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. 29 Interest Rate Risk As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we have various debt instruments, including debt associated with capital leases, that are issued at fixed rates of interest. Such financial instruments are exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates. The fair value of our total long-term debt at December 31, 2000 and 1999 was $3.7 and $2.5 billion, respectively. The potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% shift in interest rates would be approximately $127 and $78 million for 2000 and 1999, respectively. We use a combination of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. These swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify, and the notional amount, interest payment, and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt. Interest rate swaps allow us to maintain a target range of floating rate debt. The net fair value of our interest rate swaps at December 31, 2000 and 1999 was an asset of approximately $3 and $44 million, respectively. The potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% shift in interest rates would be approximately $30 and $13 million for 2000 and 1999, respectively. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve. Although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may not react correspondingly to changes in market interest rates. Equity Price Risk We hold investments in various available-for-sale equity securities that are subject to price risk. The fair value of such investments, as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, was an asset of approximately $382 and $87 million, respectively. In addition, we utilize options to hedge the price risk for certain of these equity securities. The potential change in the fair value of these investments, assuming a 10% change in prices, net of the offsetting impact of any hedges, would be approximately $31 and $9 million for 2000 and 1999, respectively. Credit Risk The forward contracts, swaps, and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. However, we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines. We do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default. Future Accounting Changes In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“FAS 133”), as amended by Statements No. 137 and No. 138, which provides a comprehensive and consistent standard for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging activities. After adoption on January 1, 2001, all derivative instruments will be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value, and changes in the fair values of such instruments will be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. We will record a one-time cumulative effect, after-tax charge totaling $14 million in the income statement, as well as an unrealized accumulated transition adjustment gain of $23 million to accumulated other comprehensive loss for the initial adoption of FAS 133 in the quarter ended March 31, 2001. Forward-Looking Statements “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and other parts of this report contain “forward-looking” statements about matters that 30 are inherently difficult to predict. These statements include statements regarding our intent, belief and current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects and future results. We have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Risk Factors The following are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forward-looking statements: • The impact of competition on a local, regional, national and international basis. Our competitors include the postal services of the U.S. and other nations, various motor carriers, express companies, freight forwarders, air couriers and others. Our industry is undergoing rapid consolidation, and the combining entities are competing aggressively for business at low rates. • The affect of general economic and other conditions in the markets in which we operate, both in the United States and internationally. Our operations in international markets are also affected by currency exchange and inflation risks. • Strikes, work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees. Such actions may affect our ability to meet our customers’ needs, and we may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service. The terms of future collective bargaining agreements may also affect our competitive position and results of operations. • The impact of complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, labor, employment and other governmental laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable laws, ordinances or regulations could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations. • An increase in the prices of gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles. We require significant quantities of gasoline and fuel and are exposed to the commodity price risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products. • Cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results due to decreased demand for our services.

S. Domestic Package Operations 2002 compared to 2001 U.S. domestic package revenue decreased $73 million, or 0.3%, for the year. This decrease was driven by a 1.9% decrease in average daily package volume, and partially offset by a 1.6% increase in revenue per piece. The decline in volume was a result of the impact of volume diversion to competitors in connection with the agreement reached on a new six-year contract with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, combined with the continued weakness in the U.S. economy. The decline in volume was most pronounced in the period surrounding the July 31, 2002 expiration date of the existing contract. On January 7, 2002, we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 3.5% for commercial deliveries. The ground residential charge increased $0.05 to $1.10 over the commercial ground rate, and this charge also was applied to express deliveries. The additional delivery area surcharge, which is added to ground deliveries in certain less accessible areas, remained at $1.50, and also was applied to express deliveries. Rates for UPS Hundredweight increased 5.9%. We also increased rates for UPS Next Day Air, UPS Next Day Air Saver, UPS 2nd Day Air, and 3 Day Select an average of 4.0%. The surcharge for UPS Next Day Air Early A.M. increased from $27.50 to $28.50. Rates for international shipments originating in the U.S. (UPS Worldwide Express, UPS Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS Standard service) increased an average of 3.9%. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. were made throughout the year and varied by geographic market. An index-based fuel surcharge continued during 2002. The index-based surcharge, which resets on a monthly basis, replaced a fixed fuel surcharge of 1.25%, which was originally implemented prior to 2001. The current surcharge is based on the National U.S. Average On-Highway Diesel Fuel Prices as reported by the U.S. Department of Energy. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 0.78%. Approximately $251 million in revenue was recorded in 2002 as a result of our fuel surcharge, a decrease of $97 million from the prior year. U.S. domestic package operating profit decreased $44 million, or 1.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2002. Operating profit was affected by a non-recurring benefit to operating expense of $175 million that occurred in 2002 related to a change in our vacation policy for non-union employees. Excluding this item, U.S. domestic package operating profit decreased $219 million, or 6.0% for the year, due to the decrease in average daily volume discussed previously and an increase in operating expenses (discussed further below). In 2001, 19 Table of Contents we recorded a credit to expense related to the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act, which benefited the U.S. domestic package segment by $28 million. 2001 compared to 2000 U.S. domestic package revenue was flat in 2001 compared to 2000, primarily as a result of a 1.0% decrease in average daily package volume, offset by a 1.7% increase in average revenue per piece. The decrease in volume resulted from the declining U.S. economy during 2001. For the first quarter of 2001, average daily domestic volume was up 1.3%. However, average daily domestic volume was down 0.9% during the second quarter, down 3.4% during the third quarter, and down 0.8% during the fourth quarter. The third quarter decline was largely a result of the events of September 11. Also affecting the comparison were two extra operating days in 2000 compared to 2001. During the first quarter of 2001, we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 3.1% for commercial deliveries. The ground residential charge increased $0.05 to $1.05 over the commercial ground rate, and we increased rates for UPS Next Day Air, UPS Next Day Air Saver, UPS 2nd Day Air, and 3 Day Select an average of 3.7%. The surcharge for UPS Next Day Air Early A.M. increased from $25.00 to $27.50. Rates for international shipments originating in the U.S. (UPS Worldwide Express, UPS Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS Standard service) increased by 2.9%. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. were made throughout 2001 and varied by geographic market. In addition, all package rates during 2001, until December 10th, included a 1.25% fuel surcharge. Effective December 10, 2001, we implemented an index-based surcharge, which initially reduced the surcharge rate to 0.75% and resets on a monthly basis. Approximately $348 million in revenue was recorded in 2001 as a result of our fuel surcharge, an increase of $218 million over the prior year. U.S. domestic package operating profit decreased by $309 million due primarily to the decline in volume discussed previously. This decrease was mitigated by cost control initiatives implemented during the year. These initiatives focused on many of our semi-variable costs and included curtailing non-union hiring, eliminating new consulting projects, reevaluating all capital expenditures and information technology projects in process, plus a variety of other items. International Package Operations 2002 compared to 2001 For the year ended December 31, 2002, international package revenue improved $435 million, or 10.2% (8.1% currency-adjusted), due primarily to volume growth for our export products and strong revenue per piece improvements. This volume growth was driven primarily by the Europe region, which had an increase in average daily export volume of 13.6%, and the Asia-Pacific region, which had an increase in average daily export volume of 17.1%. In total, international package average daily volume increased 0.7% and average revenue per piece increased 9.1% (6.8% currency-adjusted). The improvement in operating profit for our international package operations was $197 million for the year. In 2002, operating profit benefited from an $11 million reduction to expense related to the change in vacation policy. Excluding the effect of this item, operating profit increased by $186 million, or 148.8% for the year, $22 million of which was due to currency fluctuations. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to export volume growth of 8.6% and a strong increase in revenue per piece. In addition, the shutdown of the U.S. West Coast ports during the latter part of 2002 had a beneficial impact on our international package results. In 2002, this segment benefited by $11 million from the elimination of goodwill amortization. In 2001, operating profit benefited from a $46 million credit to expense related to the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act. 2001 compared to 2000 The increase in international package revenue in 2001 was due primarily to an increase in cargo revenue and a 10.9% volume growth for our export products, offset by a decline in the revenue per piece for these 20 Table of Contents products. The increase in cargo revenue resulted primarily from increased volume, which was driven by the integration of our Challenge Air operations in Latin America. Our Europe region was a significant contributor to the export volume increase. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, average revenue per piece increased 1.7%. Overall average daily package volume increased over 5% for international operations. The decline in the operating profit of our international package operations during 2001 resulted primarily from increased expenses, particularly those expenses associated with aircraft used in this segment (maintenance, rental and fuel) as we continued to add airlift capabilities to further expand our international presence. We recorded $11 million of goodwill amortization in our international package segment in both 2001 and 2000. Non-Package Operations 2002 compared to 2001 Non-package revenue increased $589 million, or 28.3%, during 2002. 20.4% of this revenue growth was due to acquisitions and the remaining 7.9% was organic. UPS Logistics Group revenue was up $286 million or 38.8% for the year, of which approximately half was due to acquisitions. UPS Freight Services revenue grew $204 million, or 27.5%, primarily due to having a full year of revenue from Fritz Companies Inc., which we acquired in May 2001. Revenue growth at UPS Freight Services was hindered by the sale of the FedEx brokerage business in March 2002. Adjusting for the effect of this sale, Freight Services would have reported organic revenue growth of approximately 4% during 2002. Non-package operating profit decreased by $19 million, or 8.8%, for the year. Operating profit was affected by a restructuring charge and related expenses of $106 million primarily related to the integration of our Freight Services and Logistics Group operations, and an $11 million reduction to expense related to a change in our vacation policy. Excluding the impact of these items, non-package operating profit increased by $76 million, or 35.0%. In 2002, this segment benefited from a $61 million reduction in goodwill expense as a result of the elimination of goodwill amortization. Non-package operating profit includes $112 million (compared to $113 million in 2001) of intersegment profit, with a corresponding amount of operating expense, which reduces operating profit, in the U.S. domestic package segment. 2001 compared to 2000 The increase in non-package revenue in 2001 resulted primarily from the impact of acquisitions, particularly Fritz, which was included in our Freight Services unit. Non-package revenue also increased due to the continued growth of the UPS Logistics Group. The Logistics Group revenue increase was primarily due to increases in our supply chain management and service parts logistics offerings. Other non-package revenue also increased as a result of acquisitions (First International Bancorp and Mail Boxes Etc.), offset by a decrease in third-party air operations revenue due to the discontinuation of our charter passenger services. The decrease in non-package operating profit was partially due to the $49 million gain we recognized from the sale of our UPS Truck Leasing subsidiary in the first quarter of 2000. The remaining decrease was due to start-up, integration and operating costs for several subsidiaries that we were developing or acquired, along with goodwill amortization expense associated with acquisitions. During 2001, we recorded $61 million of goodwill amortization in our non-package segment, which was an increase of $33 million over 2000. Non-package operating profit included $113 million (compared to $101 million in 2000) of intersegment profit. Operating Expenses and Operating Margin 2002 compared to 2001 Consolidated operating expenses increased by $817 million, or 3.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2002, operating expenses were affected by the $106 million restructuring charge and related expenses in our non-package segment, and the $197 million credit to expense related to the change in our vacation policy. Excluding the effect of these items, operating expenses increased by $908 million, or 3.4%, for the year. 21 Table of Contents Excluding the $197 million credit to expense related to the change in vacation policy, compensation and benefits increased by $744 million, or 4.3%, for the year, primarily due to increased costs associated with health and retirement benefits. Other operating expenses increased by $164 million, or 1.8%, excluding the $106 million restructuring charge and related expenses. The non-package segment accounted for $513 million of the $908 million total increase in operating expenses. This was principally due to acquisitions that we completed during the first nine months of 2001. In 2002, operating expenses benefited from the absence of $72 million of expense related to the elimination of goodwill amortization. In 2001, other operating expenses were reduced by $74 million for compensation under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act. Adjusting for the effects of the restructuring charge and related expenses and vacation policy change, our operating margin, defined as operating profit as a percentage of revenue, decreased from 13.1% during 2001 to 12.8% during 2002. This decline is primarily due to a 90 basis point decline in the operating margin for our U.S. domestic package segment, which experienced a volume-driven decline in profit. 2001 compared to 2000 In 2001, operating expenses increased by $1.373 billion, or 5.5%, with compensation and benefits up $851 million and other operating expenses up $522 million. The 5.1% increase in compensation and benefits included a $101 million reduction in pension benefits expense. Depreciation and amortization and other occupancy expenses (primarily rent and utilities) accounted for over one-half of the 6.2% increase in other operating expenses. Much of the increase in operating expenses was related to expanding our capabilities and service offerings for our non-package segment. Excluding the non-package segment, operating expenses increased by 2.5% over 2000. Depreciation and amortization expense included $72 million of goodwill amortization, a $33 million increase from 2000. Our adjusted operating margin declined from 15.3% for 2000 to 13.1% for 2001. This decline continued the trend that began in the fourth quarter of 2000 as the economy began to weaken. Investment Income/Interest Expense 2002 compared to 2001 The decrease in investment income of $96 million for 2002 is primarily due to a combination of lower interest rates and lower balances available for investment. 2001 compared to 2000 The decrease in investment income of $368 million for 2001 is due to two factors relating to 2000. First, in the first quarter of 2000, we recognized a $241 million gain on investments held by our Strategic Enterprise Fund in two companies that were acquired by other companies. In addition, we earned income on the $5.3 billion in net IPO proceeds available for investment prior to the tender offer that occurred in early March 2000, and the $1.2 billion in IPO proceeds that were not utilized for the tender offer. 22 Table of Contents Net Income and Earnings Per Share 2002 compared to 2001 Net income for 2002 was $3.182 billion, an increase of $783 million from $2.399 billion in 2001, resulting in an increase in diluted earnings per share to $2.81 in 2002 from $2.10 in 2001. Adjusting for the non-recurring FAS 133 cumulative expense adjustment, net of tax, of $26 million, our net income in 2001 would have been $2.425 billion, or $2.12 per diluted share. In 2002, our results were affected by the fourth quarter restructuring charge and related expenses of $106 million, the non-recurring FAS 142 cumulative expense adjustment of $72 million, the credit to compensation and benefits resulting from the change in our vacation policy for non-union employees of $197 million, and the credit related to the reversal of a portion of the previously established tax assessment liability of $1.023 billion. Excluding the impact of these non-recurring items, our 2002 net income would have been $2.422 billion, or $2.14 per diluted share (compared to $2.12 in 2001). 2001 compared to 2000 Net income for 2001 amounted to $2.399 billion, or $2.10 per diluted share, compared to $2.934 billion, or $2.50 per diluted share, for 2000. Our 2000 results reflected certain non-recurring items, which include the gains on our Strategic Enterprise Fund investments and the sale of our Truck Leasing subsidiary, offset partially by a charge for retroactive costs associated with creating new full-time jobs from existing part-time Teamster jobs. Our 2001 results reflect a FAS 133 cumulative expense adjustment, net of tax, of $26 million. Excluding these non-recurring transactions for each of these periods, adjusted net income for 2001 would have been $2.425 billion, a decrease of $370 million from adjusted net income of $2.795 billion for 2000. Adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased from $2.38 in 2000 to $2.12 in 2001. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations. We maintain significant cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and short-term investments, amounting to $3.014 billion at December 31, 2002. As part of our continuing share repurchase program, $1.0 billion was authorized for share repurchases in February 2002, of which $705 million was still available as of December 31, 2002. We maintain two commercial paper programs under which we are authorized to borrow up to $7.0 billion. Approximately $1.036 billion was outstanding under these programs as of December 31, 2002, all of which was classified as a current liability. The average interest rate on the amount outstanding at December 31, 2002 was 1.3%. In addition, we maintain an extendible commercial notes program under which we are authorized to borrow up to $500 million. No amounts were outstanding under this program at December 31, 2002. We maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks that provide revolving credit facilities of $1.25 billion each, with one expiring on April 24, 2003 and the other expiring on April 27, 2005. Interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90-day LIBOR plus 15 basis points. There were no borrowings under either of these agreements as of December 31, 2002. We also maintain a $1.0 billion European medium-term note program. Under this program, we may issue notes from time to time, denominated in a variety of currencies. At December 31, 2002, $1.0 billion was available under this program. We have a $2.0 billion shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the U.S. There was approximately $1.552 billion issued under this shelf registration statement at December 31, 2002. As of December 31, 2002, $910 million in notes have been issued under the UPS Notes program. These notes have various terms and maturities, all with fixed interest rates. The notes are callable at various stated times after issuance, and $345 million of the notes have been called since the inception of the program. As of December 31, 2002, $565 million in UPS Notes were outstanding. 23 Table of Contents On August 9, 1999, the United States Tax Court held that we were liable for tax on income of Overseas Partners Ltd. (“OPL”), a Bermuda company that had reinsured excess value (“EV”) package insurance purchased by our customers beginning in 1984, and that we were liable for additional tax for the 1983 and 1984 tax years. The Court held that for the 1984 tax year we were liable for taxes of $31 million on income reported by OPL, penalties and penalty interest of $93 million, and interest for a total after-tax exposure estimated at approximately $246 million. The IRS took similar positions to those advanced in the Tax Court decision for tax years subsequent to 1984. Based on the Tax Court decision, we estimated that our total after-tax exposure for tax years 1984 through 1999 could have been as high as $2.353 billion. In our second quarter 1999 financial statements, we recorded a tax assessment charge of $1.786 billion, which included an amount for related state tax liabilities. The charge included taxes of $915 million and interest of $871 million. This assessment resulted in a tax benefit of $344 million related to the interest component of the assessment. As a result, our net charge to net income for the tax assessment was $1.442 billion, increasing our total after-tax reserve at that time with respect to these matters to $1.672 billion. The tax benefit of deductible interest was included in income taxes in 1999; however, since none of the income on which this tax assessment was based was our income, we did not classify the tax charge as income taxes. We determined the size of our reserve with respect to these matters in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In 1999, we estimated our most likely liability based on the initial Tax Court decision. In making this determination, we concluded that, based on the Tax Court decision, it was more likely that we would be required to pay taxes on income reported by OPL and interest, but that it was not probable that we would be required to pay any penalties and penalty interest. In our prior estimation, if penalties and penalty interest ultimately were determined to be payable, we would have had to record an additional charge of up to $681 million. Further, as a result of the unfavorable Tax Court decision, and in order to stop the potential accrual of additional interest that might ultimately have been determined to be due to the IRS, on August 31, 1999 we paid $1.349 billion, and on August 8, 2000 paid an additional $91 million, to the IRS related to these matters for the 1984 through 1994 tax years. We included the profit of the EV insurance program, using the IRS’s methodology for calculating these amounts, for both 1998 and 1999 in filings we made with the IRS in 1999. In February 2000, we paid $339 million to the IRS related to these matters for the 1995 through 1997 tax years. On June 20, 2001, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed the Tax Court’s decision. On September 13, 2001, the Eleventh Circuit denied the IRS’s petition to have the appeal reheard en banc. The IRS did not appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court and, consequently, the case was remanded to the Tax Court to consider alternative arguments raised by the parties. In January 2003, we and the IRS finalized settlement of all outstanding tax issues related to EV package insurance. Under the settlement of these issues, we agreed to adjustments that will result in income tax due of approximately $562 million, additions to tax of $60 million and related interest. The amount due to the IRS as a result of the settlement is less than amounts we previously had accrued (as described above). As a result of the settlement, we recorded income, before taxes, of $1.023 billion ($776 million after tax) during the fourth quarter of 2002. The refunds and credits associated with this settlement are expected to occur over the next several years. The EV program that was the subject of the Tax Court decision has been changed since September 1999. The revised arrangement should eliminate the issues considered by the Tax Court and the Eleventh Circuit related to OPL. The IRS has proposed adjustments, unrelated to the EV package insurance matters discussed above, regarding the allowance of deductions and certain losses, the characterization of expenses as capital rather than ordinary, the treatment of certain income, and our entitlement to the investment tax credit and the research tax credit in the 1985 through 1990 tax years. The proposed adjustments would result in $10 million of additional income tax expense. The IRS has also issued a report taking a similar position with respect to 24 Table of Contents some of these issues for each of the years from 1991 through 1994. That report proposes adjustments that would result in $50 million in additional income tax expense. In November 2002, the IRS issued a report taking a similar position with respect to some of these issues for each of the years from 1995 through 1998. That report proposes adjustments that would result in $13 million in additional income tax expense. For the 1985 through 1998 tax years, unpaid interest on these adjustments through December 31, 2002 could aggregate up to approximately $381 million, after the benefit of related tax deductions. We expect that we will prevail on substantially all of these issues. Specifically, we believe that our practice of expensing the items that the IRS alleges should have been capitalized is consistent with the practices of other industry participants. The IRS may take similar positions with respect to some of these issues for each of the years 1999 through 2002. The IRS’s proposed adjustments include penalties and penalty interest. We believe that the possibility that such penalties and penalty interest will be sustained is remote. We believe that the eventual resolution of these issues will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. We are named as a defendant in 23 pending lawsuits that seek to hold us liable for the collection of premiums for EV insurance in connection with package shipments since 1984. Based on state and federal tort, contract and statutory claims, these cases generally claim that we failed to remit collected EV premiums to an independent insurer; we failed to provide promised EV insurance; we acted as an insurer without complying with state insurance laws and regulations; and the price for EV insurance was excessive. These actions were filed after the August 9, 1999 Tax Court decision. As discussed above, on June 20, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled in our favor and reversed the Tax Court decision. These 23 cases have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation proceeding (“MDL Proceeding”) in federal court in New York. The Court has ruled on the motions to dismiss, granting our motions with respect to all of the plaintiffs’ tort claims and all of their breach of contract claims prior to August 26, 1994. Claims asserted under specific federal statutes, and breach of contract claims commencing on August 26, 1994, may proceed at this time. We intend to continue to seek dismissal of these remaining claims. The defendants in the MDL Proceeding, including UPS, have stipulated to conditional certification of a plaintiff class in most of the lawsuits challenging the EV insurance program for our shippers. Class certification is a procedural step that allows claims to be resolved at one time as to all potential claimants; it does not depend on or reflect the merits of the underlying claims. Defendants may move later to set aside or modify the class certification. The cases subject to the class certification stipulation will proceed to a single trial before the federal court presiding over the MDL Proceeding, instead of being returned for trial to the numerous federal courts around the country from which they were transferred. In addition, plaintiffs in the five cases with pending motions to remand to state court have withdrawn these motions. In addition to the cases in which UPS is named as a defendant, there also is an action, Smith v. Mail Boxes Etc., against Mail Boxes Etc. and its franchisees relating to UPS EV insurance purchased through Mail Boxes Etc. centers. This case also has been consolidated into the MDL Proceeding. The plaintiff has moved to have the case remanded back to state court. We believe that the allegations in these cases have no merit and intend to continue to defend them vigorously. The ultimate resolution of these cases cannot presently be determined. In addition, we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business. We believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Due to the events of September 11, 2001, increased security requirements for air carriers may be forthcoming; however, we do not anticipate that such measures will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In addition, our insurance premiums have risen and we have taken several actions, including self-insuring certain risks, to mitigate the expense increase. 25 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2002, we had approximately 230,000 employees (64% of our total employees) employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the Teamsters. On October 7, 2002, the Teamsters ratified a new master agreement with UPS that runs through July 31, 2008. The new agreement is retroactive to August 1, 2002. The majority of our pilots are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association, which becomes amendable January 1, 2004. Our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727, which becomes amendable on November 1, 2006. In addition, the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. These agreements run through July 31, 2009. In November 2002, we announced rate increases, which took effect on January 6, 2003, that are in line with previous rate increases. We increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 3.9% for commercial deliveries. The ground residential surcharge increased $0.05 to $1.15 over the commercial ground rate. The additional delivery area surcharge added to residential deliveries in certain less accessible areas increased $0.25 to $1.75. Rates for UPS Hundredweight increased 5.9%. In addition, we increased rates for UPS Next Day Air an average of 3.4% and increased rates for deferred services by 4.5%. Rates for international shipments originating in the U.S. (UPS Worldwide Express, UPS Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service) increased an average of 3.9%. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. generally are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market. The index-based fuel surcharge remains in effect, and currently is 1.50%. We believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long-term needs for the operation of our business, including anticipated capital expenditures such as commitments for aircraft purchases, through 2009. Following is a summary of capital expenditures (in millions): 2002 2001 2000 Buildings and facilities $ 528 $ 763 $ 947 Aircraft and parts 638 932 645 Vehicles 41 303 156 Information technology 451 374 399 $ 1,658 $ 2,372 $ 2,147 We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $2.0 billion in 2003. These expenditures will provide for replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth and include the projected cost of capitalized software. A discussion of our anticipated future payments under operating leases, capital leases, debt obligations, and purchase commitments is provided in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. A discussion of our unfunded lending commitments is provided in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. All of these market risks arise in the normal course of business, as we do not engage in speculative trading activities. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we utilize a variety of foreign exchange, interest rate, equity and commodity forward contracts, options, and swaps. The following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk. We utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates, interest rate yield curves, and commodity and equity prices. For options and instruments with non-linear returns, models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to 26 Table of Contents determine the impact of market shifts. There are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. A discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to an increase in the prices of refined fuels, principally jet-A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline, which are used in the transportation of packages. Additionally, we are exposed to an increase in the prices of other energy products, primarily natural gas and electricity, used in our operating facilities throughout the world. We use a combination of options, swaps, and futures contracts to provide some protection from rising fuel and energy prices. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted fuel and energy consumption for periods up to one year. The net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 was an asset (liability) of $34 and $(27) million, respectively. The potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $38 million at December 31, 2002. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, operating expenses, and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate. We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. We use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset (liability) of approximately $(3) and $4 million, respectively. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $42 million at December 31, 2002. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates. Exchange rates rarely move in the same direction. The assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. Interest Rate Risk As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, we have various debt instruments, including debt associated with capital leases, that are issued at fixed rates of interest. Such financial instruments are exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates. The fair value of our total long-term debt, including current maturities, at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $4.926 and $5.338 billion, respectively. The potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately $264 million at December 31, 2002. We use a combination of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. These swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify, and the notional amount, interest payment, and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt. Interest rate swaps allow us to maintain a target range of floating rate debt. The net fair value of our interest rate swaps at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was an asset (liability) of $(62) and $(74) million, respectively. The potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately $37 million at December 31, 2002. 27 Table of Contents As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we have certain investments in securities that are purchased at fixed rates of interest. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the fair value of our investments in debt securities was $481 and $691 million, respectively. The potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately $7 million at December 31, 2002. Additionally, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, we hold certain finance receivables, primarily commercial loans and finance leases, at fixed rates of interest. These assets are exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the fair value of our investments in finance receivables was $1.492 billion and $982 million, respectively. The potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately $5 million at December 31, 2002. Equity Price Risk We hold investments in various equity securities that are subject to price risk, and for certain of these securities, we utilize options to hedge this price risk. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the fair value of such investments was $322 and $382 million, respectively. The potential loss in the fair value of such investments, assuming a 10% decline in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges, would be approximately $10 million. Credit Risk The forward contracts, swaps, and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. However, we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines. We do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default. Future Accounting Changes In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 146 “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities” (“FAS 146”). FAS 146 provides guidance on the recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that such liabilities be recognized when incurred. This statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated on or after January 1, 2003. As discussed in Note 17, we implemented a restructuring program involving the integration of our Freight Services and Logistics Group operations in the fourth quarter of 2002. As this restructuring program was initiated in 2002, we accounted for this restructuring program using the existing guidance in EITF 94-3 “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)”. Therefore, the adoption of FAS 146 on January 1, 2003 had no effect on our results of operations or financial condition. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge and related expenses in the amount of $106 million, which is classified in other operating expenses. In 2003, we plan to adopt the fair value measurement provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“FAS 123”), which is considered the preferable accounting method for stock-based employee compensation. Under FAS 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure”, we have elected to adopt the measurement provisions of FAS 123 using the prospective method. Under this approach, all future employee stock option grants and other stock-based compensation will be expensed to compensation and benefits over the vesting period based on the fair value at the date the stock-based compensation is granted. We will continue to provide pro forma income and earnings per share information related to prior awards. The expensing of stock-based compensation is expected to reduce diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.02 in 2003. By 2006, we expect to realize the full impact of adopting FAS 123, and estimate that diluted earnings per share will be reduced by approximately $0.08 in that year. 28 Table of Contents In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (“FIN 45”). FIN 45 requires that a liability be recognized at fair value at the inception of certain guarantees for the obligations undertaken by the guarantor. FIN 45 also requires additional disclosures for certain guarantee contracts. The disclosure provisions of FIN 45 are effective for financial statements ending after December 15, 2002, while the recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. We are currently evaluating the impact of the recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45 on our financial statements. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46”). FIN 46 provides guidance on the identification of variable interest entities, and the assessment of a company’s interests in a variable interest entity to determine whether consolidation is appropriate. FIN 46 requires the consolidation of a variable interest entity by the primary beneficiary if the entity does not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved. FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and is effective for periods beginning after June 15, 2003 for existing variable interest entities. As we have no material exposures to special purpose entities or other off-balance sheet arrangements, we anticipate that the effects of adopting FIN 46 will not be material to our results of operations or financial condition. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As indicated in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles. We base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates, which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements. While estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts, we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Contingencies As discussed in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies. We have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies” (“FAS 5”). FAS 5 requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency. The actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates. If a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate, a future charge to income would result. Likewise, if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate, a future credit to income would result. Goodwill Impairment The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” (“FAS 142”) in June 2001. As a result of the issuance of this new standard, goodwill is no longer amortized, but is subjected to annual impairment testing. Goodwill impairment testing requires that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet. The estimation of fair value requires that we make judgments concerning future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. Our estimate of the fair value of goodwill could change over time based on a variety of factors, including the actual operating performance of the underlying reporting units. Upon adoption of FAS 142, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $72 million ($0.06 per diluted share), as of January 1, 2002, related to our Mail Technologies business. The primary factor resulting in the impairment charge was the lower than anticipated growth experienced in the expedited mail delivery business. As of December 31, 2002, our recorded goodwill was $1.070 billion. 29 Table of Contents Self-Insurance Accruals We self-insure estimated costs associated with workers’ compensation claims, automotive liability, and general business liabilities, up to certain limits. Insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The recorded levels of these reserves are determined by outside actuaries, who incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. Trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves. We believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate, however actual experience in claim frequency and/or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations. Pension and Postretirement Medical Benefits The Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions.” These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, rate of compensation increases, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuaries and information as to historical experience and performance. Differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. The impact of decreasing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets to 9.21% and the decrease in the discount rate to 6.75%, combined with other factors, will increase our pension plan expense by approximately $135 million in 2003. Financial Instruments As discussed in Notes 2, 3, 8, and 16 to our consolidated financial statements, and in the “Market Risk” section of this report, we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk. Certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Fair values are based on listed market prices, when such prices are available. To the extent that listed market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations. Certain financial instruments, including over-the-counter derivative instruments, are valued using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual and market prices, correlations, time value, credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors. Changes in the fixed income, equity, foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our results of operations. Forward-Looking Statements “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and other parts of this report contain “forward-looking” statements about matters that inherently are difficult to predict. These statements include statements regarding our intent, belief and current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects and future results. We have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Risk Factors The following are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forward-looking statements: • The effect of general economic and other conditions in the markets in which we operate, both in the United States and internationally. Our operations in international markets also are affected by currency exchange and inflation risks. 30 Table of Contents • Strikes, work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees. Such actions may affect our ability to meet our customers’ needs, and customers may do more business with our competitors if they believe that such actions may adversely affect our ability to provide service. We may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service. The terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations. • The impact of complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, labor, employment and other governmental laws and regulations, and the impact of new laws and regulations that may result from increased security concerns following the events of September 11, 2001. Our failure to comply with applicable laws, ordinances or regulations could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations. • The impact of competition on a local, regional, national and international basis. Our competitors include the postal services of the U.S. and other nations, various motor carriers, express companies, freight forwarders, air couriers and others. Our industry is undergoing rapid consolidation, and the combining entities are competing aggressively for business at low rates. • Possible disruption of supplies, or an increase in the prices, of gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles as a result of war or other factors. We require significant quantities of gasoline and fuel and are exposed to the commodity price risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products. • Cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results due to decreased demand for our services.

Certain of this information is considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Specifically, we refer to operating profit, operating margin, net income and earnings per share on an “as adjusted” basis, excluding certain transactions that we believe are not indicative of future results. We have presented these measures since we believe that meaningful analysis of our financial performance requires an understanding of the factors underlying that performance and our judgments about the likelihood that particular factors will repeat. When these “non-GAAP financial measures” have been used, we have provided reconciliations of these adjusted measures to the appropriate GAAP measure for comparability purposes. U.S. Domestic Package Operations 2003 compared to 2002 U.S. domestic package revenue increased $1.098 billion, or 4.6%, for the year, which was driven by a 2.1% increase in average daily package volume and a 2.6% increase in revenue per piece. Ground volume increased by 1.5% in 2003, reversing a 2.0% decline in 2002, reflecting the improving U.S. economy and the impact that labor negotiations had on lowering volume during portions of 2002. The volume for our UPS Next Day Air products increased by 6.7% during the year, driven by double-digit growth in overnight letters which was influenced by the strength in mortgage refinancing activity during 2003. The increase in U.S. domestic average daily package volume was more significant in the latter half of the year. In the third and fourth quarters of 2003, total U.S. domestic average daily package volume increased 3.2% and 4.9%, respectively. The overall improvement in revenue per piece was primarily due to the rate increase that became effective in January 2003, with some additional benefit from the fuel surcharge as described below. The decline in revenue per piece for the Next Day Air products, and the relatively smaller increase for the deferred products, was primarily due to the relatively higher growth in letter volume compared with the growth in package volume for these products. 18 Table of Contents On January 6, 2003, we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 3.9% for commercial deliveries. The ground residential surcharge increased $0.05 to $1.15 over the commercial ground rate. The additional delivery area surcharge added to residential deliveries in certain ZIP codes increased $0.25 to $1.75. Rates for UPS Hundredweight increased 5.9%. In addition, we increased rates for UPS Next Day Air an average of 3.4% and increased rates for deferred services by 4.5%. Rates for international shipments originating in the United States (UPS Worldwide Express, UPS Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS Standard service) increased an average of 3.9%. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the United States generally are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market. During 2003, the index-based fuel surcharge reset on a monthly basis and was based on the National U.S. Average On-Highway Diesel Fuel Prices as reported by the U.S. Department of Energy. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge increased to 1.47% in 2003 from 0.78% in 2002, resulting in an increase in fuel surcharge revenue of $144 million. Effective in 2004, we have discontinued the fuel surcharge on ground service, while a new indexed surcharge is being applied to our Next Day Air and deferred products. This new fuel surcharge for the domestic air products is based on the U.S. Energy Department’s Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel. This change will have a negative impact on revenue for our ground products, while having a beneficial impact on revenue for our Next Day Air and deferred products. U.S. domestic package operating profit declined $304 million, or 8.5%, primarily due to the slow volume and revenue growth combined with an increase in operating expenses (discussed further below under the section titled “operating expenses and operating margin”). U.S. domestic package operating profit increased 2.0% in the third quarter and decreased by 9.4% in the fourth quarter. However, in the fourth quarter of 2002, U.S. domestic package operating profit benefited from a $175 million credit due to a change in our vacation policy for non-union employees. Without the vacation-related credit in the 2002 results, fourth quarter operating profit would have increased 9.6% and the decline for the year ending December 31, 2003 would have been $129 million, or 3.8%. 2002 compared to 2001 U.S. domestic package revenue decreased $73 million, or 0.3%, for the year. This decrease was driven by a 1.9% decrease in average daily package volume, and partially offset by a 1.6% increase in revenue per piece. The decline in volume was a result of the impact of volume diversion to competitors prior to the agreement reached on a new six-year contract with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, combined with the continued weakness in the U.S. economy. The decline in volume was most pronounced in the period surrounding the July 31, 2002 expiration date of the previous contract. On January 7, 2002, we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 3.5% for commercial deliveries. The ground residential charge increased $0.05 to $1.10 over the commercial ground rate, and this charge also was applied to express deliveries in 2002. The additional delivery area surcharge added to residential deliveries in certain ZIP codes, remained at $1.50, and also was applied to express deliveries in 2002. Rates for UPS Hundredweight increased 5.9%. We also increased rates for UPS Next Day Air, UPS Next Day Air Saver, UPS 2nd Day Air, and 3 Day Select an average of 4.0%. The surcharge for UPS Next Day Air Early A.M. increased from $27.50 to $28.50. Rates for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service) increased an average of 3.9%. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. were made throughout 2002 and varied by geographic market. An index-based fuel surcharge, which began in February 2002 and reset on a monthly basis, replaced a fixed fuel surcharge of 1.25%. The indexed surcharge was based on the National U.S. Average On-Highway Diesel Fuel Prices as reported by the U.S. Department of Energy. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge for the year ended December 31, 2002 was 0.78%. Approximately $251 million in revenue was recorded in 2002 as a result of our fuel surcharge, a decrease of $97 million from the prior year. 19 Table of Contents U.S. domestic package operating profit decreased $44 million, or 1.2%, for 2002, primarily due to the decrease in average daily volume discussed previously and an increase in operating expenses (discussed further below). In 2002, operating profit benefited from a credit to operating expense of $175 million that occurred related to a change in our vacation policy for non-union employees. In 2001, we recorded a credit to expense related to the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act, which benefited the U.S. domestic package segment by $28 million. International Package Operations 2003 compared to 2002 International package revenue improved $881 million, or 18.8%, for the year due primarily to the 8.6% volume growth for our export products and strong revenue per piece improvements, a portion of which can be attributed to the impact of currency. Revenue increased $443 million during the year due to currency fluctuations. Export volume increased throughout the world, with Asia-Pacific, Canada, and the Americas showing double-digit export volume growth, and U.S. and European export volume increasing slightly over 6%. European export volume growth was adversely impacted by the strength of the Euro and the weak European economy. Domestic volume increased 0.9% for the year, which reverses a 3.2% decline from the previous year, and was also negatively affected by the weak European economy. Export revenue per piece increased 12.5% for the year (3.3% currency-adjusted), due to improvements in product mix and continued focus on yield management. In total, international average daily package volume increased 3.7% and average revenue per piece increased 17.4% (6.2% currency-adjusted). The 7.6% decline in cargo revenue during the year was largely due to a reduction of flights in our air network in the Americas. The improvement in operating profit for our international package operations was $387 million for the year, $117 million of which was due to favorable currency fluctuations. This increase in operating profit was primarily due to the strong export volume growth and revenue per piece increases described previously. In 2002, international operating profit benefited from an $11 million credit to operating expense as a result of a change in our vacation policy for non-union employees. 2002 compared to 2001 For the year ended December 31, 2002, international package revenue improved $435 million, or 10.2% (8.1% currency-adjusted), due primarily to volume growth for our export products and strong revenue per piece improvements. This volume growth was driven primarily by the Asia-Pacific region, which had an increase in average daily export volume of 17.1%, and the Europe region, which had an increase in average daily export volume of 13.6%. In total, international average daily package volume increased 0.7% and average revenue per piece increased 9.1% (6.8% currency-adjusted). The improvement in operating profit for our international package operations was $197 million for the year, $22 million of which was due to currency fluctuations. The increase in operating profit was primarily due to export volume growth of 8.6% and a strong increase in revenue per piece. In addition, the shutdown of the U.S. West Coast ports during the latter part of 2002 had a beneficial impact on our international package results. In 2002, operating profit benefited from an $11 million reduction to expense related to the change in vacation policy. Operating profit in 2002 benefited, compared with 2001, from an $11 million reduction of expense due to the elimination of goodwill amortization. In 2001, operating profit benefited from a $46 million credit to expense related to the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act. Non-Package Operations 2003 compared to 2002 Non-package revenue increased $234 million, or 8.8%, for the year. UPS Supply Chain Solutions, which comprises our former UPS Freight Services and UPS Logistics Group businesses, increased revenue by 8.0% during the year. This increase was due to growth in our supply chain management and other logistics businesses, with international revenues growing faster than in the U.S., partially as a result of favorable 20 Table of Contents currency fluctuations. Favorable currency fluctuations accounted for $74 million of the increase in revenue. Freight forwarding revenue increased at a slower rate, which was influenced by global economic conditions and increased air revenue in 2002 as a result of the work disruption at U.S. west coast ports. The remainder of our non-package operations, which includes Mail Boxes Etc. (the franchisor of Mail Boxes Etc. and The UPS Store), UPS Capital Corp., our mail and consulting services and our excess value package insurance business, increased revenue by 11.0% for the year, primarily due to increased franchise revenue at Mail Boxes Etc. and strong results from our Mail Innovations unit. Non-package operating profit increased $266 million, or 134.3%, for the year. This increase was primarily due to higher operating profit from our Supply Chain Solutions unit, which was driven by the increase in revenue as well as the cost savings produced by our integration and restructuring program. Non-package operating profit in 2002 was reduced by the $106 million restructuring charge and related expenses, and was increased by $11 million due to the change in our vacation policy for non-union employees. Non-package operating profit includes $114 million (compared to $112 million in 2002) of intersegment profit, with a corresponding amount of operating expense, which reduces operating profit, in the U.S. domestic package segment. During 2003, we sold our Mail Technologies business unit in a transaction that increased net income by $14 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. The gain consisted of a pre-tax loss of $24 million recorded in other operating expenses within the non-package segment, and a tax benefit of $38 million recognized in conjunction with the sale. The tax benefit exceeds the pre-tax loss from this sale primarily because the goodwill impairment charge we previously recorded for the Mail Technologies business unit was not deductible for income tax purposes. Consequently, our tax basis was greater than our book basis, thus producing the tax benefit described above. Also during 2003, we sold our Aviation Technologies business unit and recognized a pre-tax gain of $24 million ($15 million after-tax, or $0.01 per diluted share), which is recorded in other operating expenses within the non-package segment. The operating results of both the Mail Technologies unit and the Aviation Technologies unit were previously included in our non-package segment, and were not material to non-package operating results in any of the periods presented. 2002 compared to 2001 Non-package revenue increased $589 million, or 28.3% during 2002. 20.4% of this revenue growth was due to acquisitions and the remaining 7.9% was due to organic growth. UPS Supply Chain Solutions revenue was up $490 million, or 33.1%, for the year, much of which was due to having a full year of revenue from Fritz Companies Inc., which we acquired in May 2001, and other acquisitions. Revenue growth at Supply Chain Solutions was hindered by the sale of the FedEx brokerage business in March 2002. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, UPS Supply Chain Solutions would have reported revenue growth of approximately 8% during 2002. Non-package operating profit decreased by $19 million, or 8.8%, for the year. In 2002, operating profit was affected by a restructuring charge and related expenses of $106 million primarily related to the integration of our Freight Services and Logistics Group operations, and an $11 million reduction to expense related to a change in our vacation policy for non-union employees. Operating profit in 2002 benefited, compared with 2001, from a $61 million reduction in goodwill expense as a result of the elimination of goodwill amortization. Non-package operating profit includes $112 million in 2002 (compared to $113 million in 2001) of intersegment profit, with a corresponding amount of operating expense, which reduces operating profit, in the U.S. domestic package segment. Operating Expenses and Operating Margin 2003 compared to 2002 Consolidated operating expenses increased by $1.864 billion, or 6.9%, for the year, $398 million of which was due to currency fluctuations in our international package and non-package segments. Compensation and 21 Table of Contents benefits increased by $1.388 billion, or 7.7%, for the year, primarily due to increased health and welfare benefit costs and higher pension expense. Stock-based compensation expense totaled $724 million in 2003, a 14.0% increase over 2002, primarily as a result of increased management incentive awards expense and adopting the measurement provisions of FAS 123 for 2003 stock-based compensation awards. Other operating expenses increased by $476 million, or 5.2%, for the year, largely due to a 12.3% increase in occupancy costs, a 10.3% increase in fuel expense, and smaller increases in purchased transportation, repairs and maintenance, and depreciation and amortization. Other operating expenses in 2002 were affected by the $106 million restructuring charge and related expenses incurred in the integration of our Freight Services and Logistics Group operations into our UPS Supply Chain Solutions unit. The growth in other occupancy expense was impacted by higher rent expense on buildings and facilities, higher real estate taxes, and weather-related increases in natural gas and utilities expense. The fuel expense increase was due to higher fuel prices in 2003, somewhat offset by hedging gains and lower fuel usage. The increase in purchased transportation expense was influenced by the impact of currency and growth in our international package and Supply Chain Solutions businesses. The growth in depreciation and amortization reflects the addition of new aircraft, the completion of facilities projects (including UPS Worldport), and increased amortization of capitalized software. The increase in repairs and maintenance was primarily due to higher vehicle, aircraft, and equipment maintenance expense. The increase in other expenses was due to a $75 million impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003, resulting from an impairment evaluation performed when we permanently removed a number of Boeing 727 and DC-8 aircraft from service. Of the total $75 million impairment charge, $69 million impacted the U.S. domestic package segment and $6 million impacted the international package segment. Our operating margin, defined as operating profit as a percentage of revenue, increased to 13.3% in 2003 from 13.1% in 2002. This increase is due to the growth in operating margin in our international package and non-package segments, which benefited from the revenue increases described previously. The operating margin for our three business segments was as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2002 Operating Segment 2003 Reported As Adjusted 2001 U.S. domestic package 13.1 % 14.9 % 14.2 % 15.1 % International package 12.7 % 6.9 % 6.6 % 2.9 % Non-package 16.0 % 7.4 % 11.0 % 10.4 % 2002 adjusted operating margins exclude the effects of the vacation change, which increased operating profit (U.S. domestic — $175 million, 0.7% effect on operating margin; international package — $11 million, 0.3%; and non-package — $11 million, 0.4%), and the effects of the restructuring charge, which reduced non-package operating profit by $106 million and operating margin by 4.0%. 2002 compared to 2001 Consolidated operating expenses increased by $817 million, or 3.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2002. Compensation and benefits increased $543 million, or 3.1%, due primarily to increased costs associated with health and retirement benefits. In 2002, compensation and benefits were reduced by the $197 million credit to expense related to the change in our vacation policy for non-union employees. Other operating expenses increased by $274 million, or 3.1%, for the year. In 2002, other operating expenses were affected by the $106 million restructuring charge and related expenses. In 2002, depreciation and amortization benefited from the absence of $72 million of expense related to the elimination of goodwill amortization. In 2001, other operating expenses were reduced by $74 million for compensation under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act. The non-package segment accounted for $513 million of the $817 million total increase in operating expenses. This was principally due to acquisitions that we completed during the first nine months of 2001. Our 22 Table of Contents consolidated operating margin, defined as operating profit as a percentage of revenue, remained at 13.1% during 2001 and 2002. Investment Income/ Interest Expense 2003 compared to 2002 The decrease in investment income of $45 million in 2003 is primarily due to a $58 million impairment charge recognized during the first quarter of 2003. We periodically review our investments for indications of other than temporary impairment considering many factors, including the extent and duration to which a security’s fair value has been less than its cost, overall economic and market conditions, and the financial condition and specific prospects for the issuer. During the first quarter of 2003, after considering the continued decline in the U.S. equity markets, we recognized an impairment charge of $58 million, primarily related to our investment in S&P 500 equity portfolios. The $52 million decline in interest expense in 2003 was primarily the result of lower commercial paper balances outstanding, lower interest rates on variable rate debt, and lower floating rates on interest rate swaps. 2002 compared to 2001 The decrease in investment income of $96 million for 2002 is primarily due to a combination of lower interest rates and lower balances available for investment in 2002. Net Income and Earnings Per Share 2003 compared to 2002 Net income for 2003 was $2.898 billion, a decrease of $284 million from the $3.182 billion achieved in 2002, resulting in a decrease in diluted earnings per share from $2.81 in 2002 to $2.55 in 2003. Net income in 2002 was favorably impacted by $776 million after-tax ($0.68 per diluted share) resulting from the reversal of a portion of the previously established tax assessment liability, and by $121 million after-tax ($0.11 per diluted share) from the credit to expense as a result of the change in our vacation policy for non-union employees. Net income in 2002 was adversely impacted by $65 million after-tax ($0.06 per diluted share) due to the restructuring charge and related expenses and by $72 million after-tax ($0.06 per diluted share) due to the FAS 142 cumulative expense adjustment. Excluding the effect of the preceeding items, net income for 2002 would have been $2.422 billion, or $2.14 per diluted share. Net income in 2003 benefited from the $14 million after-tax gain ($0.01 per diluted share) on the sale of our Mail Technologies unit in the second quarter of 2003, the $15 million after-tax gain ($0.01 per diluted share) on the sale of our Aviation Technologies unit in the third quarter of 2003, and the $18 million after-tax gain ($0.02 per diluted share) due to the redemption of our $300 million cash-settled convertible senior notes. In addition, 2003 income tax expense was reduced by $55 million ($0.05 per diluted share) due to the resolution of various tax issues with the Internal Revenue Service during the first quarter, by $22 million ($0.02 per diluted share) due to a tax contingency accrual adjustment resulting from a favorable ruling on the tax treatment for jet engine maintenance costs during the third quarter, and by $39 million ($0.03 per share) due to a lower effective state tax rate in the fourth quarter. Net income in 2003 was adversely affected by the $37 million after-tax ($0.03 per diluted share) investment impairment charge described previously. Excluding the effect of the preceeding items, net income for 2003 would have been $2.772 billion, or $2.44 per diluted share. This would represent a 14.0% increase in diluted earnings per share over the $2.14 achieved in 2002 (after taking into account the items discussed previously). 2002 compared to 2001 Net income for 2002 was $3.182 billion, an increase of $783 million from $2.399 billion in 2001, resulting in an increase in diluted earnings per share to $2.81 in 2002 from $2.10 in 2001. Net income in 2001 was adversely impacted by the FAS 133 cumulative expense adjustment of $26 million after-tax ($0.02 per diluted share), without which net income would have been $2.425 billion, or $2.12 per diluted share. In 2002, our 23 Table of Contents results were affected by the fourth quarter restructuring charge and related expenses of $65 million after-tax ($0.06 per diluted share), the FAS 142 cumulative expense adjustment of $72 million after-tax ($0.06 per diluted share), the credit to compensation and benefits resulting from the change in our vacation policy for non-union employees of $121 million after-tax ($0.11 per diluted share), and the credit related to the reversal of a portion of the previously established tax assessment liability of $776 million after-tax ($0.68 per diluted share). Excluding the effect of the preceeding items, net income for 2002 would have been $2.422 billion, or $2.14 per diluted share. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net Cash From Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $4.646, $5.688 and $4.570 billion in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in 2003 operating cash flows from 2002 was primarily the result of the funding of $1.1 billion into our pension plans during 2003. As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, projected pension contributions in 2004 are approximately $426 million. In November 2003, we announced rate increases, which took effect on January 5, 2004. The overall impact is in line with previous years’ rate increases. We increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 1.9% for commercial deliveries. The ground residential surcharge increased $0.25 to $1.40 over the commercial ground rate. An additional delivery area surcharge of $1.00 was implemented for commercial deliveries in certain ZIP codes. Rates for UPS Hundredweight increased 5.9%. In addition, we increased rates for UPS Next Day Air an average of 2.9% and increased rates for deferred services by 2.9%. Rates for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service) increased an average of 3.5%. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. were made throughout the past year and varied by geographic market. In addition, we discontinued the fuel surcharge on ground service, while a new index is being applied to our Next Day Air, deferred products, and international services. This new fuel surcharge for the domestic air products is based on the U.S. Energy Department’s Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel. The index for shipments originating in Europe will be based on the Rotterdam ARA spot price of kerosene-type jet fuel. Net Cash Used In Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $1.942, $2.194 and $3.053 billion in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The primary reason for these declines has been the slowing growth of our finance receivables portfolio, and the lack of business acquisitions during 2002 and 2003. Capital expenditures represent the primary use of cash in investing activities, as follows (in millions): 2003 2002 2001 Buildings and facilities $ 451 $ 528 $ 763 Aircraft and parts 1,019 638 932 Vehicles 161 41 303 Information technology 316 451 374 $ 1,947 $ 1,658 $ 2,372 We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $2.2 billion in 2004. These expenditures will provide for replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth and include the projected cost of capitalized software. We fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations. 24 Table of Contents Net Cash Used In Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $2.180, $2.090 and $1.493 billion in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Our primary use of cash in financing activities has been to repay long-term debt, repurchase stock, and pay dividends. During 2003, we repaid over $1.2 billion in debt, primarily consisting of $492 million of commercial paper, $300 million in cash-convertible notes, and $411 million in repayments of UPS Notes. Issuances of debt primarily consisted of UPS Notes. We consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non-scheduled repayments of debt. In August 2003, a total of $1.0 billion was authorized for share repurchases as part of our continuing share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2003, $858 million of this authorization was available for future share repurchases. We repurchased a total of $398 million of common stock in 2003. We increased our cash dividends per share to $0.92 in 2003 from $0.76 in 2002, resulting in an increase in total cash dividends paid to $1.026 billion from $840 million. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other relevant factors. We expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends. In February 2004, the Board of Directors declared a $0.28 per share dividend, which represents a 12% increase over the $0.25 previous quarterly dividend. The dividend is payable on March 9, 2004 to shareowners of record on February 23, 2004. Sources of Credit We maintain two commercial paper programs under which we are authorized to borrow up to $7.0 billion. Approximately $544 million was outstanding under these programs as of December 31, 2003, with an average interest rate of 0.96%. The entire balance outstanding has been classified as a current liability on our balance sheet. In addition, we maintain an extendible commercial notes program under which we are authorized to borrow up to $500 million. No amounts were outstanding under this program at December 31, 2003. We maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks. These agreements provide revolving credit facilities of $1.0 billion each, with one expiring on April 22, 2004 and the other on April 24, 2008. Interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90-day LIBOR plus 15 basis points. There were no borrowings under either of these agreements as of December 31, 2003. We also maintain a $1.0 billion European medium-term note program. Under this program, we may issue notes from time to time, denominated in a variety of currencies. No amounts were outstanding under this program at December 31, 2003. In August 2003, we filed a $2.0 billion shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the United States. There was approximately $85 million issued under this shelf registration statement at December 31, 2003, all of which consists of issuances under our UPS Notes program. Commitments We have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of operating leases, capital leases, debt obligations, and purchase commitments. We intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow 25 Table of Contents from operations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2003 (in millions): Capitalized Operating Debt Purchase Year Leases Leases Principal Commitments 2004 $ 68 $ 314 $ 621 $ 858 2005 96 264 2 747 2006 69 187 2 833 2007 119 128 1 798 2008 128 99 27 697 After 2008 137 457 2,697 604 Total $ 617 $ 1,449 $ 3,350 $ 4,537 We believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long-term needs for the operation of our business, including anticipated capital expenditures such as commitments for aircraft purchases, through 2009. Contingencies On August 9, 1999 the United States Tax Court Tax Court held that we were liable for tax on income of Overseas Partners Ltd., a Bermuda company that had reinsured EV insurance purchased by our customers beginning in 1984, and that we were liable for additional tax for the 1983 and 1984 tax years. The IRS took similar positions to those advanced in the Tax Court decision for tax years subsequent to 1984 through 1998. On June 20, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled in our favor and reversed the Tax Court decision. In January 2003, we and the IRS finalized settlement of all outstanding tax issues related to EV package insurance. Under the terms of settlement, we agreed to adjustments that will result in income tax due of approximately $562 million, additions to tax of $60 million and related interest. The amount due to the IRS as a result of the settlement is less than amounts we previously had accrued. As a result, we recorded income, before taxes, of $1.023 billion ($776 million after tax) during the fourth quarter of 2002. The refunds and credits associated with this settlement are expected to occur over the next several years. The IRS has proposed adjustments, unrelated to the EV package insurance matters discussed above, regarding the allowance of deductions and certain losses, the characterization of expenses as capital rather than ordinary, the treatment of certain income, and our entitlement to the investment tax credit and the research tax credit in the 1985 through 1990 tax years. The proposed adjustments would result in $10 million of additional income tax. The IRS has also issued a report taking a similar position with respect to some of these issues for each of the years from 1991 through 1994. That report proposes adjustments that would result in $42 million in additional income tax. The IRS’s proposed adjustments include penalties and penalty interest. We believe that the possibility that such penalties and penalty interest will be sustained is remote. In November 2002, the IRS issued a report taking a similar position with respect to some of these issues for each of the years 1995 through 1998. That report proposes adjustments that would result in $7 million in additional income tax. For the 1985 through 1998 tax years, unpaid interest on these adjustments through December 31, 2003 could aggregate up to approximately $178 million, after the benefit of related tax deductions. We expect that we will prevail on substantially all of these issues. Specifically, we believe that our practice of expensing the items that the IRS alleges should have been capitalized is consistent with the practices of other industry participants. The IRS may take similar positions with respect to some of these issues for each of the years 1999 through 2003. We believe that the eventual resolution of these issues will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. We are named as a defendant in twenty-three pending lawsuits that seek to hold us liable for the collection of premiums for excess value (“EV”) insurance in connection with package shipments since 1984. Based on state and federal tort, contract and statutory claims, these cases generally claim that we failed to remit collected EV premiums to an independent insurer; we failed to provide promised EV insurance; we acted 26 Table of Contents as an insurer without complying with state insurance laws and regulations; and the price for EV insurance was excessive. These actions all were filed after the August 9, 1999 United States Tax Court decision, in which the Tax Court held that we were liable for tax on income of Overseas Partners Ltd., a Bermuda company that had reinsured EV insurance purchased by our customers beginning in 1984, and that we were liable for additional tax for the 1983 and 1984 tax years. On June 20, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled in our favor and reversed the Tax Court decision. In January 2003, we and the IRS finalized settlement of all outstanding tax issues relating to EV package insurance. These twenty-three cases have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation proceeding (“MDL Proceeding”) in federal court in New York. In addition to the cases in which UPS is named as a defendant, there also is an action, Smith v. Mail Boxes Etc., against Mail Boxes Etc. and its franchisees relating to UPS EV insurance and related services purchased through Mail Boxes Etc. centers. This case also has been consolidated into the MDL Proceeding. While expressly denying any and all liability, the parties have obtained preliminary court approval of a global settlement resolving all claims and all cases in the MDL Proceeding. The proposed settlement requires several steps before it becomes final, including notice to the settlement class, and obtaining final court approval. If the proposed settlement becomes final, we would provide to qualifying settlement class members vouchers toward the purchase of specified UPS services and pay a portion of the plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees, the total amount of which will be determined by the Court. The ultimate cost to us of the proposed settlement will depend on a number of factors. We do not believe that this proposed settlement will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. In addition, we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business. We believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. We participate in a number of trustee-managed multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. Several factors could result in higher future contributions to these plans, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in demographics, and increased benefits to participants. At this time, we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions, if any, or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could result from our participation in these plans. Due to the events of September 11, 2001, increased security requirements for air carriers may be forthcoming; however, we do not anticipate that such measures will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In addition, our insurance premiums have risen and we have taken several actions, including self-insuring certain risks, to mitigate the expense increase. As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately 228,000 employees (64% of our total employees) employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (“Teamsters”). These agreements run through July 31, 2008. The majority of our pilots are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association, which became amendable January 1, 2004. Negotiations are ongoing with the assistance of the National Mediation Board. Our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727, which becomes amendable on November 1, 2006. In addition, the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. These agreements run through July 31, 2009. Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. All of these market risks arise in the normal course of business, as we do 27 Table of Contents not engage in speculative trading activities. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we utilize a variety of foreign exchange, interest rate, equity and commodity forward contracts, options, and swaps. The following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk. We utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates, interest rate yield curves, and commodity and equity prices. For options and instruments with non-linear returns, models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts. There are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. A discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to an increase in the prices of refined fuels, principally jet-A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline, which are used in the transportation of packages. Additionally, we are exposed to an increase in the prices of other energy products, primarily natural gas and electricity, used in our operating facilities throughout the world. We use a combination of options, swaps, and futures contracts to provide some protection from rising fuel and energy prices. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted fuel and energy consumption for periods up to one year. The net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 was an asset (liability) of $30 and $34 million, respectively. The potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $17 and $38 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, operating expenses, and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate. We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. We use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset (liability) of $(48) and $(3) million, respectively. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $97 and $42 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates. Exchange rates rarely move in the same direction. The assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. Interest Rate Risk As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, we have various debt instruments, including debt associated with capital leases, that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest. We use a combination of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. These swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify, and the notional amount, interest payment, and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt. Our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short-term (primarily LIBOR) interest rates. The potential change in annual 28 Table of Contents interest expense resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in short-term interest rates applied to our floating rate debt and swap instruments at December 31, 2003 and 2002 would be approximately $25 and $28 million, respectively. As described in Note 1 and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we have certain investments in debt auction rate, and preferred securities that accrue income at variable rates of interest. The potential change in annual investment income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our investments exposed to variable interest rates at December 31, 2003 and 2002 would be approximately $31 and $19 million, respectively. Additionally, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, we hold a portfolio of finance receivables, that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest. The potential change in annual income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our variable rate finance receivables at December 31, 2003 and 2002 would be immaterial. This interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios, these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts. We adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions. Equity Price Risk We hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk, and for certain of these securities, we utilize options to hedge this price risk. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the fair value of such investments was $95 and $322 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of such investments, assuming a 10% change in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges, would be approximately $10 million at both December 31, 2003 and 2002. Credit Risk The forward contracts, swaps, and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. However, we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines. We do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 146 “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities” (“FAS 146”). FAS 146 provides guidance on the recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that such liabilities be recognized when incurred. This statement was effective for exit or disposal activities initiated on or after January 1, 2003. As discussed in Note 17, we implemented a restructuring program involving the business unit integration of our Freight Services and Logistics Group operations in the fourth quarter of 2002. As this restructuring program was initiated in 2002, we accounted for this restructuring program using the existing guidance in EITF 94-3 “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)”. Therefore, the adoption of FAS 146 on January 1, 2003 had no effect on our results of operations or financial condition. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge and related expenses in the amount of $106 million, which is classified in other operating expenses. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (“FIN 45”). FIN 45 requires that a liability be recognized at fair value at the inception of certain guarantees for the obligations undertaken by the guarantor. FIN 45 also requires additional disclosures for certain guarantee contracts. The disclosure provisions of FIN 45 were effective for financial statements ending after Decem- 29 Table of Contents ber 15, 2002, while the recognition and initial measurement provisions were applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of FIN 45 was not material to our results of operations or financial condition. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”, to address perceived weaknesses in accounting for entities commonly known as special purpose or off balance sheet. In addition to numerous FASB Staff Positions written to clarify and improve the application of FIN 46, the FASB recently announced a deferral for certain entities, and an amendment to FIN 46 entitled FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003) “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46”). FIN 46 provides guidance for identifying the party with a controlling financial interest resulting from arrangements or financial instruments rather than voting interests. FIN 46 defines the term “variable interest entity” and is based on the premise that if a business enterprise absorbs a majority of such an entity’s expected losses and/or receives a majority of its expected residual returns, that enterprise has a controlling financial interest, and would thus require consolidation of the variable interest entity. As of December 31, 2003, we have adopted FIN 46, and the effects of adoption were not material to our results of operations or financial condition. On July 1, 2003, we adopted FASB Statement No. 149 “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“FAS 149”). FAS 149 amends FAS 133 for certain decisions made by the FASB as part of the Derivatives Implementation Group process. FAS 149 also amends FAS 133 to incorporate clarifications of the definition of a derivative. The adoption of FAS 149 was not material to our results of operations or financial condition. On July 1, 2003, we adopted FASB Statement No. 150 “Accounting for Certain Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity” (“FAS 150”). FAS 150 establishes how an issuer measures certain freestanding financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity, and requires that such instruments be classified as liabilities. The adoption of FAS 150 was not material to our results of operations or financial condition. In December 2003, the FASB revised Statement No. 132, “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits” (FAS 132). The revised standard requires new disclosures in addition to those required by the original standard about the assets, obligations, cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. As revised, FAS 132 is effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003, and we have included these disclosures in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As indicated in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles. We base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates, which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements. While estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts, we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Contingencies — As discussed in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies. We have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies” (“FAS 5”). FAS 5 requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency. The actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates. If a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate, a future charge to income would result. Likewise, if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate, a future credit to income would result. 30 Table of Contents Goodwill Impairment — The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” (“FAS 142”) in June 2001. As a result of the issuance of this new standard, goodwill is no longer amortized, but is subjected to annual impairment testing. Goodwill impairment testing requires that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet. The estimation of fair value requires that we make judgments concerning future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. Our estimate of the fair value of goodwill could change over time based on a variety of factors, including the actual operating performance of the underlying reporting units. Upon adoption of FAS 142, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $72 million ($0.06 per diluted share), as of January 1, 2002, related to our Mail Technologies business. The primary factor resulting in the impairment charge was the lower than anticipated growth experienced in the expedited mail delivery business. In conjunction with our annual test of goodwill in 2002, we recorded an additional impairment charge of $2 million related to our Mail Technologies business, resulting in total goodwill impairment of $74 million for 2002. Our annual impairment test performed in 2003 resulted in no goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2003, our recorded goodwill was $1.173 billion. Self-Insurance Accruals — We self-insure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims, automotive liability, and general business liabilities, up to certain limits. Insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Recorded balances are based on reserve levels determined by outside actuaries, who incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. Trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves. We believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate, but actual experience in claim frequency and/or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations. Pension and Postretirement Medical Benefits — The Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions.” These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, rate of compensation increases, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuaries and other advisors and information as to historical experience and performance. Differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. The impact of decreasing the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets to 8.96% and the decrease in the discount rate to 6.25%, combined with other factors such as the additional fundings which occurred during 2003, will increase our pension plan expense by approximately $18 million in 2004. Financial Instruments — As discussed in Notes 2, 3, 8, and 16 to our consolidated financial statements, and in the “Market Risk” section of this report, we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk. Certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Fair values are based on listed market prices, when such prices are available. To the extent that listed market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations. Certain financial instruments, including over-the-counter derivative instruments, are valued using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual and market prices, correlations, time value, credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors. Changes in the fixed income, equity, foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our results of operations. Depreciation, Residual Value, and Impairment of Fixed Assets — As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately $13.9 billion of net fixed assets, the most significant category of which is aircraft. In accounting for fixed assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets. 31 Table of Contents In estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft, we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types. Subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program, changes in the utilization of the aircraft, governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary. Adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense. When appropriate, we evaluate our fixed assets for impairment. Factors that would indicate potential impairment may include, but are not limited to, a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. In December 2003, we permanently removed from service a number of Boeing 727 and DC-8 aircraft. As a result, we conducted an impairment evaluation, which resulted in a $75 million impairment charge during the fourth quarter for these aircraft. This charge is classified in the caption “other expenses” within other operating expenses (see Note 13). UPS continues to operate all of its other aircraft and continues to experience positive cash flow. Forward-Looking Statements “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and other parts of this report contain ”forward-looking” statements about matters that inherently are difficult to predict. These statements include statements regarding our intent, belief and current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects and future results. We have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Risk Factors The following are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forward-looking statements: • The effect of general economic and other conditions in the markets in which we operate, both in the United States and internationally. Our operations in international markets are also affected by currency exchange and inflation risks. • The impact of competition on a local, regional, national and international basis. Our competitors include the postal services of the U.S. and other nations, various motor carriers, express companies, freight forwarders, air couriers and others. Our industry is undergoing rapid consolidation, and the combining entities are competing aggressively for business at low rates. • The impact of complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, labor, employment and other governmental laws and regulations, and the impact of new laws and regulations that may result from increased security concerns following the events of September 11, 2001. Our failure to comply with applicable laws, ordinances or regulations could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations. • Strikes, work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees. Such actions may affect our ability to meet our customers’ needs, and customers may do more business with our competitors if they believe that such actions may adversely affect our ability to provide service. We may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service. The terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations • Possible disruptions of supplies, or an increase in the prices, of gasoline and fuel and jet fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles as a result of war or other factors. We require significant 32 Table of Contents quantities of gasoline and fuel and are exposed to the commodity price risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products. • Cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results due to decreased demand for our services.

Ground volume increased 4.0% during the year, driven in part by the improving U.S. economy, and reflects growth in both commercial and residential deliveries. Ground volume increased 4.8% during the first nine months of the year, but slowed to 1.5% during the fourth quarter. Total Next Day Air volume (up 0.8%) and total deferred volume (down 0.9%) were both significantly affected by declines in letter volume, but offset by an increase in Next Day Air package volume. The 2004 decline in Next Day Air and deferred letter volume is largely due to the slowdown in mortgage refinancing, which was notably strong in 2003. Ground revenue per piece increased 0.9% for the year primarily due to the impact of a rate increase that took effect in 2004, but growth was adversely impacted by approximately 130 basis points due to the removal of the fuel surcharge on ground products, as discussed below. Next Day Air revenue per piece increased 6.6%, while deferred revenue per piece increased 6.1%, primarily due to the shift in product mix from letters to packages, the rate increase, and the modified fuel surcharge on domestic air products. On January 5, 2004, a rate increase took effect which was in line with previous years’ rate increases. We increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 1.9% for commercial deliveries. The ground residential surcharge increased $0.25 to $1.40 over the commercial ground rate. An additional delivery area surcharge of $1.00 was implemented for commercial deliveries in certain ZIP codes. Rates for UPS Hundredweight increased 5.9%. In addition, we increased rates for UPS Next Day Air an average of 2.9% and increased rates for deferred services by 2.9%. In addition, we discontinued the fuel surcharge on ground products, while we began to apply a new indexed surcharge to domestic air products. This indexed fuel surcharge for the domestic air products is based on the U.S. Energy Department’s Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel. Based on published rates, the 21 average fuel surcharge applied to our air products during 2004 was 7.07%, compared with the average surcharge of 1.47% applied to both air and ground products in 2003, resulting in an increase in domestic fuel surcharge revenue of $290 million during the year. U.S. domestic package operating profit increased $73 million, or 2.2%, primarily due to the increase in volume and revenue growth discussed previously, but somewhat offset by increased aircraft impairment charges ($91 million in 2004 compared to $69 million in 2003) and a $63 million pension charge related to the consolidation of data systems used to collect and accumulate plan participant data. 2003 compared to 2002 U.S. domestic package revenue increased $1.098 billion, or 4.6%, for the year, which was driven by a 2.1% increase in average daily package volume and a 2.6% increase in revenue per piece. Ground volume increased by 1.5% in 2003, reversing a 2.0% decline in 2002, reflecting the improving U.S. economy and the impact that labor negotiations had on lowering volume during portions of 2002. The volume for our UPS Next Day Air products increased by 6.7% during the year, driven by double-digit growth in overnight letters which was influenced by the strength in mortgage refinancing activity during 2003. The increase in U.S. domestic average daily package volume was more significant in the latter half of the year. In the third and fourth quarters of 2003, total U.S. domestic average daily package volume increased 3.2% and 4.9%, respectively. The overall improvement in revenue per piece was primarily due to the rate increase that became effective in January 2003, with some additional benefit from the fuel surcharge as described below. The decline in revenue per piece for the Next Day Air products, and the relatively smaller increase for the deferred products, was primarily due to the relatively higher growth in letter volume compared with the growth in package volume for these products. On January 6, 2003, we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of 3.9% for commercial deliveries. The ground residential surcharge increased $0.05 to $1.15 over the commercial ground rate. The additional delivery area surcharge added to residential deliveries in certain ZIP codes increased $0.25 to $1.75. Rates for UPS Hundredweight increased 5.9%. In addition, we increased rates for UPS Next Day Air an average of 3.4% and increased rates for deferred services by 4.5%. During 2003, the index-based fuel surcharge reset on a monthly basis and was based on the National U.S. Average On-Highway Diesel Fuel Prices as reported by the U.S. Department of Energy. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge increased to 1.47% in 2003 from 0.78% in 2002, resulting in an increase in fuel surcharge revenue of $144 million. Effective in 2004, we discontinued the fuel surcharge on ground service, while an indexed surcharge was applied to our Next Day Air and deferred products. This indexed fuel surcharge for the domestic air products was based on the U.S. Energy Department’s Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel. U.S. domestic package operating profit declined $304 million, or 8.5%, primarily due to the slow volume and revenue growth combined with an increase in operating expenses (discussed further below under the section titled “Operating Expenses and Operating Margin”). U.S. domestic package operating profit increased 2.0% in the third quarter and decreased by 9.4% in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2002, U.S. domestic package operating profit benefited from a $175 million credit due to a change in our vacation policy for non-union employees. International Package Operations 2004 compared to 2003 International package revenue improved $1.201 billion, or 21.6%, for the year primarily due to the 12.5% volume growth for our export products and strong revenue per piece improvements. Revenue increased $295 million during the year due to currency fluctuations. Revenue growth was also impacted by the change to our fuel surcharge (discussed below) as well as rate changes, which vary by geographical market and occur throughout 22 the year. Rates for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service) increased an average of 3.5%. In January 2004, changes were made to the calculation of our fuel surcharge on international products (including U.S. export products). The surcharge is now indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions, depending on where the shipment takes place. The current surcharge is only applied to our international express products, while the previous surcharge was applied to all international products. These changes, along with higher fuel prices, had the effect of increasing international package revenue by $231 million during the year. We experienced double-digit export volume growth in each region throughout the world, with the Asia-Pacific region leading with 24% export volume growth, including a 101% increase in China export volume. Export volume continues to benefit from our expanding international network, such as the six additional flights to Shanghai, China that were added in the fourth quarter. European export volume grew in excess of 10%, and was positively influenced by the addition of 10 countries to the European Union. Non-U.S. domestic volume increased 3.7% for the year, and primarily reflects improvements in our European and Canadian domestic delivery businesses. Export revenue per piece increased 9.0% for the year (3.1% currency-adjusted), benefiting from rate increases and the impact of the fuel surcharge. In total, international average daily package volume increased 7.0% and average revenue per piece increased 13.6% (6.7% currency-adjusted). The improvement in operating profit for our international package operations was $412 million, or 58.1%, for the year, $54 million of which was due to favorable currency fluctuations. This increase in operating profit was primarily due to the strong export volume growth and revenue per piece increases described previously, and a strong increase in operating margin through better network utilization. International operating profit was adversely affected by aircraft impairment charges of $19 million in 2004, compared to a $6 million charge in 2003. 2003 compared to 2002 International package revenue improved $881 million, or 18.8%, for the year due primarily to the 8.6% volume growth for our export products and strong revenue per piece improvements, a portion of which can be attributed to the impact of currency. Revenue increased $443 million during the year due to currency fluctuations. Export volume increased throughout the world, with Asia-Pacific, Canada, and the Americas showing double-digit export volume growth, and U.S. and European export volume increasing slightly over 6%. European export volume growth was adversely impacted by the strength of the Euro and the weak European economy. Domestic volume increased 0.9% for the year, reversing a 3.2% decline from the previous year, which was also negatively affected by the weak European economy. Export revenue per piece increased 12.5% for the year (3.3% currency-adjusted), due to improvements in product mix and continued focus on yield management. In total, international average daily package volume increased 3.7% and average revenue per piece increased 17.4% (6.2% currency-adjusted). The 7.6% decline in cargo revenue during the year was largely due to a reduction of flights in our air network in the Americas. Rates for international shipments originating in the United States (UPS Worldwide Express, UPS Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS Standard service) increased an average of 3.9%. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the United States generally are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market. The improvement in operating profit for our international package operations was $387 million for the year, $117 million of which was due to favorable currency fluctuations. This increase in operating profit was primarily due to the strong export volume growth and revenue per piece increases described previously. In 2002, international operating profit benefited from an $11 million credit to operating expense as a result of a change in our vacation policy for non-union employees. 23 Non-Package Operations 2004 compared to 2003 Non-package revenue increased $308 million, or 10.6%, for the year. UPS Supply Chain Solutions increased revenue by 10.3% during the year, with strong growth in our air and ground freight forwarding businesses, as well as our logistics business. Favorable currency fluctuations provided $73 million of the increase in revenue for the year. The remainder of our non-package operations, which includes Mail Boxes Etc. (the franchisor of Mail Boxes Etc. and The UPS Store), UPS Capital, our mail and consulting services, and our excess value package insurance business, increased revenue by 11.3% for the year, largely due to strong double-digit franchise and royalty revenue growth at Mail Boxes Etc. resulting from an expanding store base, as well as higher excess value insurance revenue. Menlo Worldwide Forwarding, which was acquired in December 2004, added $33 million in revenue. Non-package operating profit increased $59 million, or 12.7%, for the year, primarily due to improved results from our UPS Capital, mail services, and excess value insurance business. Mail Boxes Etc. experienced strong profit growth, due to the increased franchise and royalty revenue noted previously. Non-package operating profit includes $112 million (compared to $114 million in 2003) of intersegment profit for the year, with a corresponding amount of operating expense, which reduces operating profit, in the U.S. domestic package segment. During the second quarter of 2003, we sold our Mail Technologies business unit in a transaction that increased net income by $14 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. The gain consisted of a pre-tax loss of $24 million recorded in other operating expenses within the non-package segment, and a tax benefit of $38 million recognized in conjunction with the sale. The tax benefit exceeded the pre-tax loss from this sale primarily because the goodwill impairment charge we previously recorded for the Mail Technologies business unit was not deductible for income tax purposes. Consequently, our tax basis was greater than our book basis, thus producing the tax benefit described above. During the third quarter of 2003, we sold our Aviation Technologies business unit and recognized a pre-tax gain of $24 million ($15 million after-tax, or $0.01 per diluted share), which is recorded in other operating expenses within the non-package segment. The operating results of both the Mail Technologies unit and the Aviation Technologies unit were previously included in our non-package segment, and were not material to our consolidated operating results in any of the periods presented. 2003 compared to 2002 Non-package revenue increased $234 million, or 8.8%, for the year. UPS Supply Chain Solutions, increased revenue by 8.0% during the year. This increase was due to growth in our supply chain management and other logistics businesses, with international revenues growing faster than in the United States, partially as a result of favorable currency fluctuations. Favorable currency fluctuations accounted for $74 million of the increase in revenue. Freight forwarding revenue increased at a slower rate, which was influenced by global economic conditions and increased air revenue in 2002 as a result of the work disruption at U.S. west coast ports. The remainder of our non-package operations, which includes Mail Boxes Etc. (the franchisor of Mail Boxes Etc. and The UPS Store), UPS Capital, our mail and consulting services, and our excess value package insurance business, increased revenue by 11.0% for the year, primarily due to increased franchise revenue at Mail Boxes Etc. and improvements from our Mail Innovations unit. Non-package operating profit increased $266 million, or 134.3%, for the year. This increase was primarily due to higher operating profit from our Supply Chain Solutions unit, which was driven by the increase in revenue as well as the cost savings produced by our integration and restructuring program. Non-package operating profit in 2002 was reduced by the $106 million restructuring charge and related expenses, and was increased by $11 million due to the change in our vacation policy for non-union employees. Non-package operating profit includes $114 million (compared to $112 million in 2002) of intersegment profit, with a corresponding amount of operating expense, which reduces operating profit, in the U.S. domestic package segment. 24 Operating Expenses and Operating Margin 2004 compared to 2003 Consolidated operating expenses increased by $2.553 billion, or 8.8%, for the year, $311 million of which was due to currency fluctuations in our international package and non-package segments. Compensation and benefits increased by $1.588 billion, or 8.2%, for the year, largely due to increased payroll costs, increased health and welfare expense, and higher pension expense for our union pension plans. Stock-based compensation expense increased $167 million, or 23.2%, during the year, primarily as a result of increased management incentive awards expense and adopting the measurement provisions of FAS 123 prospectively beginning with 2003 stock-based compensation awards. Other operating expenses increased by $965 million, or 9.9%, for the year, largely due to a 34.9% increase in fuel expense and a 12.6% increase in purchased transportation, but were somewhat offset by a decline in depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in fuel expense was primarily due to higher prices for Jet-A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline, in addition to somewhat higher fuel usage and lower hedging gains. The increase in purchased transportation expense was influenced by the impact of currency, higher fuel prices, and volume growth in our international package business. The decline in depreciation and amortization for the year was impacted by lower depreciation expense on aircraft engines, largely due to the retirement of some older aircraft. The increase in repairs and maintenance expense was affected by increased expense on vehicle parts and airframe and engine maintenance. The increase in other occupancy expense was largely related to higher rent expense, but somewhat offset by lower real estate taxes. The increase in other expenses was affected by the $110 million impairment of aircraft, engines, and parts, as well as the $63 million pension charge discussed previously, in addition to higher advertising costs. Our consolidated operating margin, defined as operating profit as a percentage of revenue, increased in 2004 compared with 2003. The operating margins for our three business segments were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Operating Segment U.S. domestic package 12.6 % 13.1 % 14.9 % International package 16.6 % 12.7 % 6.9 % Non-package 16.3 % 16.0 % 7.4 % Consolidated 13.6 % 13.3 % 13.1 % 2003 compared to 2002 Consolidated operating expenses increased by $1.864 billion, or 6.9%, for the year, $398 million of which was due to currency fluctuations in our international package and non-package segments. Compensation and benefits increased by $1.388 billion, or 7.7%, for the year, primarily due to increased health and welfare benefit costs and higher pension expense. Stock-based compensation expense totaled $724 million in 2003, a 14.0% increase over 2002, primarily as a result of increased Management Incentive Awards expense and adopting the measurement provisions of FAS 123 for 2003 stock-based compensation awards. Other operating expenses increased by $476 million, or 5.2%, for the year, largely due to a 12.3% increase in occupancy costs, a 10.3% increase in fuel expense, and smaller increases in purchased transportation, repairs and maintenance, and depreciation and amortization. Other operating expenses in 2002 were affected by the $106 million restructuring charge and related expenses incurred in the integration of our Freight Services and Logistics Group operations into our UPS Supply Chain Solutions unit. The growth in other occupancy expense was impacted by higher rent expense on buildings and facilities, higher real estate taxes, and weather-related increases in natural gas and utilities expense. The fuel expense increase was due to higher fuel prices in 2003, somewhat offset by hedging gains and lower fuel usage. The increase in purchased transportation expense was 25 influenced by the impact of currency and growth in our international package and Supply Chain Solutions businesses. The growth in depreciation and amortization reflects the addition of new aircraft, the completion of facilities projects (including UPS Worldport), and increased amortization of capitalized software. The increase in repairs and maintenance was primarily due to higher vehicle, aircraft, and equipment maintenance expense. The increase in other expenses was primarily due to a $75 million impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003, resulting from an impairment evaluation performed when we permanently removed a number of Boeing 727 and DC-8 aircraft from service. Investment Income/Interest Expense 2004 compared to 2003 Investment income increased by $64 million during the year, primarily due to a $58 million impairment charge recognized during 2003. We periodically review our investments for indications of other than temporary impairment considering many factors, including the extent and duration to which a security’s fair value has been less than its cost, overall economic and market conditions, and the financial condition and specific prospects for the issuer. During the first quarter of 2003, after considering the continued decline in the U.S. equity markets, we recognized an impairment charge of $58 million, primarily related to our investment in S&P 500 equity portfolios. Investment income also increased in 2004 due to higher interest rates earned on cash balances, but was somewhat offset by increased equity-method losses on certain investment partnerships. The $28 million increase in interest expense during 2004 was primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on variable rate debt and certain interest rate swaps, as well as the impact of currency exchange rates and imputed interest expense associated with certain investment partnerships. The impact of higher interest rates was somewhat offset by lower average debt balances outstanding in 2004 compared to 2003. In December 2003, we redeemed $300 million in cash-settled convertible senior notes at a price of 102.703, and also terminated the swap transaction associated with the notes. The redemption amount paid was lower than the amount recorded for the fair value of the notes at the time of redemption, which, along with the cash settlement received on the swap, resulted in a $28 million non-operating gain recorded in 2003 results. 2003 compared to 2002 The decrease in investment income of $45 million in 2003 is primarily due to the $58 million impairment charge recognized during the first quarter of 2003. The $52 million decline in interest expense in 2003 was primarily the result of lower commercial paper balances outstanding, lower interest rates on variable rate debt, and lower floating rates on interest rate swaps. Net Income and Earnings Per Share 2004 compared to 2003 2004 net income was $3.333 billion, a 15.0% increase from the $2.898 billion in 2003, resulting in an increase in diluted earnings per share to $2.93 in 2004 from $2.55 in 2003. Net income in 2004 was adversely impacted by a $70 million after-tax impairment charge ($0.06 per diluted share) on Boeing 727, 747, and McDonnell Douglas DC-8 aircraft, engines, and parts, as well as a $40 million after-tax charge ($0.04 per diluted share) to pension expense resulting from the consolidation of data systems used to collect and accumulate plan participant data. Net income was positively impacted by credits to income tax expense totaling $142 million ($0.13 per diluted share) related to various items, including the resolution of certain tax matters, the removal of a portion of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets on net operating loss carryforwards, and an adjustment for identified tax contingency items. 26 Net income in 2003 was favorably impacted by the $14 million after-tax gain ($0.01 per diluted share) on the sale of Mail Technologies, the $15 million after-tax gain ($0.01 per diluted share) on the sale of Aviation Technologies, and the $18 million after-tax gain ($0.02 per diluted share) recognized upon redemption of our $300 million cash-settled senior convertible notes. Net income in 2003 was adversely impacted by the $37 million after-tax investment impairment charge ($0.03 per diluted share) described previously. Net income in 2003 was also favorably impacted by reductions in income tax expense of $116 million ($0.10 per diluted share) due to the resolution of various tax issues with the IRS, a favorable court ruling on the tax treatment of jet engine maintenance costs, and a lower effective state tax rate. 2003 compared to 2002 Net income for 2003 was $2.898 billion, a decrease of $284 million from the $3.182 billion achieved in 2002, resulting in a decrease in diluted earnings per share to $2.55 in 2003 from $2.81 in 2002. Net income in 2003 was affected by the items noted above. Net income in 2002 was favorably impacted by a $776 million after-tax ($0.68 per diluted share) benefit resulting from the reversal of a portion of the previously established tax assessment liability, and by $121 million after-tax ($0.11 per diluted share) from the credit to expense as a result of the change in our vacation policy for non-union employees. Net income in 2002 was adversely impacted by $65 million after-tax ($0.06 per diluted share) due to the restructuring charge and related expenses and by $72 million after-tax ($0.06 per diluted share) due to the FAS 142 cumulative expense adjustment. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net Cash From Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.331, $4.576, and $5.688 billion in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in 2004 operating cash flows compared with 2003 was primarily due to higher net income, decreased pension and retirement plan fundings, and cash received upon the resolution of various tax matters. In 2004, we funded $450 million to our pension plans as compared to $1.136 billion in 2003. As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, projected pension contributions to plan trusts in 2005 are approximately $723 million. In 2004, we received $610 million from our previously disclosed settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) primarily on tax matters related to excess value package insurance for tax years 1983-84 and 1991-98 (see “Contingencies” section below). As of December 31, 2004, we had a $371 million receivable recorded for the settlement related to tax years 1985-90. On October 28, 2004, we announced a rate increase and a change in the fuel surcharge that will take effect on January 3, 2005. We increased rates 2.9% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, UPS 3 Day Select, and UPS Ground. We also increased rates 2.9% for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service). Other pricing changes include an increase of $0.25 for delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain ZIP codes. The residential surcharge will increase $0.10 for UPS Ground services and $0.35 for UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air and UPS 3 Day Select. These rate changes are customary, and are consistent with previous years’ rate increases. Additionally, in January 2005 we will modify the fuel surcharge on domestic and international air services by setting a maximum cap of 9.5%. A fuel surcharge of 2% will be applied to UPS Ground services that will fluctuate after January 2005 based on the U.S. Energy Department’s On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. were made throughout the past year and varied by geographic market. Net Cash Used In Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $3.638, $2.742, and $3.281 billion in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The primary reason for the increased cash used in investing activities has been the increasing net purchases of marketable securities, due to the excess of cash generated over our capital investment needs. The increase in funds used for business acquisitions is primarily due to the Menlo Worldwide Forwarding and UPS 27 Yamato Express Co. acquisitions in 2004 (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). The cash generated from finance receivables was primarily due to principal payments on finance receivables and sales of portions of our portfolio, primarily in the receivable factoring business. Capital expenditures represent a primary use of cash in investing activities, as follows (in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Buildings and facilities $ 547 $ 451 $ 528 Aircraft and parts 829 1,019 638 Vehicles 393 161 41 Information technology 358 316 451 $ 2,127 $ 1,947 $ 1,658 As described in the “Commitments” section below, we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft, vehicles, equipment and other fixed assets to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth. We fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations. Net Cash Used In Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $2.014, $2.110 and $2.090 billion in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our primary use of cash in financing activities has been to repurchase stock, pay dividends, and repay long-term debt. In October 2004, a total of $2.0 billion was authorized for share repurchases as part of our continuing share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2004, $1.817 billion of this authorization was available for future share repurchases. We repurchased a total of $1.310 billion of common stock in 2004. We increased our cash dividends per share to $1.12 in 2004 from $0.92 in 2003, resulting in an increase in total cash dividends paid to $1.208 billion from $956 million. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other relevant factors. We expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends. In February 2005, the Board of Directors declared a $0.33 per share dividend, which represents a 17.9% increase over the $0.28 previous quarterly dividend. The dividend is payable on March 9, 2005 to shareowners of record on February 22, 2005. During 2004, we repaid $468 million in debt, primarily consisting of $264 million in commercial paper, $56 million in redemptions of UPS Notes, $57 million in scheduled principal payments on capital lease obligations, and $60 million for the redemption of our Singapore Dollar notes issue. Issuances of debt primarily consisted of $735 million in commercial paper and $41 million in UPS Notes. We consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non-scheduled repayments of debt. Sources of Credit We maintain two commercial paper programs under which we are authorized to borrow up to $7.0 billion. Approximately $1.015 billion was outstanding under these programs as of December 31, 2004, with an average interest rate of 2.10%. The entire balance outstanding has been classified as a current liability in our balance sheet. In addition, we maintain an extendable commercial notes program under which we are authorized to borrow up to $500 million. No amounts were outstanding under this program at December 31, 2004. We maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks. These agreements provide revolving credit facilities of $1.0 billion each, with one expiring on April 21, 2005 and the other on April 24, 2008. Interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90-day LIBOR plus 15 basis points. There were no borrowings under either of these agreements as of December 31, 2004. 28 In August 2003, we filed a $2.0 billion shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the United States. There was approximately $126 million issued under this shelf registration statement at December 31, 2004, all of which consists of issuances under our UPS Notes program. Our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants. These covenants generally require us to maintain a $3.0 billion minimum net worth and limit the amount of secured indebtedness available to the company. These covenants are not considered material to the overall financial condition of the company, and all covenant tests were passed as of December 31, 2004. Commitments We have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of operating leases, capital leases, debt obligations and purchase commitments. We intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2004 (in millions): Year Capitalized Leases Operating Leases Debt Principal Purchase Commitments 2005 $ 97 $ 370 $ 1,110 $ 1,012 2006 70 327 6 488 2007 121 242 — 223 2008 132 169 27 274 2009 76 128 84 637 After 2009 62 590 2,777 1,129 Total 558 $ 1,826 $ 4,004 $ 3,763 In December 2004, we amended our existing aircraft purchase agreement with Airbus Industries. The amended agreement will reduce Airbus A300-600 aircraft on order from 50 to 13, and the number of options on this aircraft from 37 to zero. These 13 aircraft remaining on order will be delivered to UPS by July 2006. Additionally, we placed a firm order for 10 Airbus A380 freighter aircraft, and obtained options to purchase 10 additional A380 aircraft. The Airbus A380 aircraft will be delivered to UPS between 2009 and 2012. The purchase commitments information above reflects the amended agreement. In January 2005, we also announced an agreement to purchase an additional 11 Boeing MD-11 pre-owned aircraft. These aircraft will be delivered to UPS between 2005 and 2007. We believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long-term needs for the operation of our business, including anticipated capital expenditures, such as commitments for aircraft purchases, for the foreseeable future. Contingencies On August 9, 1999, the United States Tax Court held that we were liable for tax on income of Overseas Partners Ltd., a Bermuda company that had reinsured excess value (“EV”) insurance purchased by our customers beginning in 1984, and that we were liable for additional tax for the 1983 and 1984 tax years. The IRS took similar positions to those advanced in the Tax Court decision for tax years subsequent to 1984 through 1998. On June 20, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled in our favor and reversed the Tax Court decision. In January 2003, we and the IRS finalized settlement of all outstanding tax issues related to EV package insurance. Under the terms of settlement, we agreed to adjustments that will result in income tax due of approximately $562 million, additions to tax of $60 million and related interest. The amount due to the IRS as a result of the settlement is less than amounts we previously had accrued. As a result, we recorded income, before taxes, of $1.023 billion ($776 million after tax) during the fourth quarter of 2002. In the first quarter of 2004, we received a refund of $185 million pertaining to the 1983 and 1984 tax years. 29 The IRS had proposed adjustments, unrelated to the EV package insurance matters discussed above, regarding the allowance of deductions and certain losses, the characterization of expenses as capital rather than ordinary, the treatment of certain income, and our entitlement to tax credits in the 1985 through 1998 tax years. In the third quarter of 2004, we settled all outstanding issues related to each of the tax years 1991 through 1998. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we received a refund of $425 million pertaining to the 1991 through 1998 tax years. We expect to receive the $371 million of refunds related to the 1985 through 1990 tax years within the next six months. The IRS may take similar positions with respect to some of the non-EV package insurance matters for each of the years 1999 through 2004. If challenged, we expect that we will prevail on substantially all of these issues. Specifically, we believe that our practice of expensing the items that the IRS alleges should have been capitalized is consistent with the practices of other industry participants. We believe that the eventual resolution of these issues will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. We were named as a defendant in twenty-three now-dismissed lawsuits that sought to hold us liable for the collection of premiums for EV insurance in connection with package shipments since 1984. Based on state and federal tort, contract and statutory claims, these cases generally claimed that we failed to remit collected EV premiums to an independent insurer; we failed to provide promised EV insurance; we acted as an insurer without complying with state insurance laws and regulations; and the price for EV insurance was excessive. These actions were all filed after the August 9, 1999 U.S. Tax Court decision, discussed above, which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit later reversed. These twenty-three cases were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation proceeding (“MDL Proceeding”) in federal court in New York. In addition to the cases in which UPS was named as a defendant, there also was an action, Smith v. Mail Boxes Etc., against Mail Boxes Etc. and its franchisees relating to UPS EV insurance and related services purchased through Mail Boxes Etc. centers. That case also was consolidated into the MDL Proceeding. In late 2003, the parties reached a global settlement resolving all claims and all cases in the MDL proceeding. In reaching the settlement, we and the other defendants expressly denied any and all liability. On July 30, 2004, the court issued an order granting final approval to the substantive terms of the settlement. No appeals were filed and the settlement became effective on September 8, 2004. Pursuant to the settlement, UPS has provided qualifying settlement class members with vouchers toward the purchase of specified UPS services and will pay the plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees, the total amount of which still remains to be determined by the court. Other defendants have contributed to the costs of the settlement, including the attorneys’ fees. The ultimate cost to us of the proposed settlement will depend on a number of factors, including how many vouchers settlement class members actually use. We do not believe that this proposed settlement will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state courts containing various class-action allegations under state wage-and-hour laws. In one of these cases, Marlo v. UPS, which has been certified as a class action in California state court, plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime, penalties for missed meal and rest periods, interest and attorneys’ fees. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of 1,200 full-time supervisors. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these cases. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. In addition, we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business. We believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. 30 We participate in a number of trustee-managed multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. Several factors could result in potential funding deficiencies which could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in demographics, and increased benefits to participants. At this time, we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions, if any, or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could result from our participation in these plans. Due to the events of September 11, 2001, increased security requirements for air carriers may be forthcoming; however, we do not anticipate that such measures will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. In addition, our insurance premiums have risen and we have taken several actions, including self-insuring certain risks, to mitigate the expense increase. As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately 229,000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (“Teamsters”). These agreements run through July 31, 2008. The majority of our pilots are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association, which became amendable January 1, 2004. Negotiations are ongoing with the assistance of the National Mediation Board. Our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727, which becomes amendable on November 1, 2006. In addition, the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. These agreements run through July 31, 2009. Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. All of these market risks arise in the normal course of business, as we do not engage in speculative trading activities. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we utilize a variety of foreign exchange, interest rate, equity and commodity forward contracts, options, and swaps. The following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk. We utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates, interest rate yield curves, and commodity and equity prices. For options and instruments with non-linear returns, models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts. There are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. A discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to an increase in the prices of refined fuels, principally jet-A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline, which are used in the transportation of packages. Additionally, we are exposed to an increase in the prices of other energy products, primarily natural gas and electricity, used in our operating facilities throughout the world. We use a combination of options, swaps, and futures contracts to provide some protection from rising fuel and energy prices. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted fuel and energy consumption for periods of one to three years. The net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk, excluding the underlying 31 exposures, as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 was an asset of $101 and $30 million, respectively. The potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10% change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $32 and $17 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, operating expenses, and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate. We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and the Canadian Dollar. We use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods up to one year. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was a liability of $(28) and $(48) million, respectively. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $117 and $97 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates. Exchange rates rarely move in the same direction. The assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. Interest Rate Risk As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, we have issued debt instruments, including debt associated with capital leases, that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest. We use a combination of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. These swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify, and the notional amount, interest payment, and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt. Our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short-term (primarily LIBOR) interest rates. The potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in short-term interest rates applied to our floating rate debt and swap instruments at December 31, 2004 and 2003 would be approximately $29 and $25 million, respectively. As described in Note 1 and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we have certain investments in debt, auction rate, and preferred securities that accrue income at variable rates of interest. The potential change in annual investment income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our investments exposed to variable interest rates at December 31, 2004 and 2003 would be approximately $45 and $31 million, respectively. Additionally, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest. The potential change in the annual income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our variable rate finance receivables at December 31, 2004 and 2003 would be immaterial. This interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios, these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts. We adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions. 32 Equity Price Risk We hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk, and for certain of these securities, we utilize options to hedge this price risk. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the fair value of such investments was $77 and $95 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of such investments, assuming a 10% change in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges, would be approximately $8 and $10 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003. Credit Risk The forward contracts, swaps, and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. However, we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines. We do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“FAS 123R”), which replaces FAS 123 and supercedes APB 25. FAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values, beginning with the first interim or annual period after June 15, 2005, with early adoption encouraged. We will adopt FAS 123R in the third quarter of 2005, using the prospective method of adoption. The prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of FAS 123R. There will be no impact upon adoption, as we will already be expensing all unvested option and restricted stock awards. In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) No. 109-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” (“FSP 109-2”). FSP 109-2 provides guidance under FAS 109 with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Jobs Act”) on enterprises’ income tax expense and deferred tax liability. The Jobs Act was enacted on October 22, 2004. FSP 109-2 states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the Jobs Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying FAS 109. We have not yet completed our evaluation of the impact of the repatriation provisions of the Jobs Act. Accordingly, as provided for in FSP 109-2, we have not adjusted our income tax provision or deferred tax liabilities to reflect the repatriation provisions of the Jobs Act. The adoption of the following recent accounting pronouncements did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition: • FASB Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others—An Interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34”; • FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities—An Interpretation of ARB No. 51”; • FASB Statement No. 132(R) (revised 2003), “Employer’s Disclosures about Pensions and Other Post-Retirement Benefits—An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106”; • FASB Statement No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”; • FASB Statement No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”; 33 • FASB Statement No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity”; and • FSP 106-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003”. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As indicated in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles. We base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates, which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements. While estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts, we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Contingencies—As discussed in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies. We have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies” (“FAS 5”). FAS 5 requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency. The actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates. If a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate, a future charge to income would result. Likewise, if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate, a future credit to income would result. Goodwill Impairment—The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“FAS 142”), in June 2001. As a result of the issuance of this standard, goodwill is no longer amortized, but is subjected to annual impairment testing. Goodwill impairment testing requires that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet. The estimation of fair value requires that we make judgments concerning future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. Our estimate of the fair value of goodwill could change over time based on a variety of factors, including the actual operating performance of the underlying reporting units. Upon adoption of FAS 142, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $72 million ($0.06 per diluted share), as of January 1, 2002, related to our Mail Technologies business. The primary factor resulting in the impairment charge was the lower than anticipated growth experienced in the expedited mail delivery business. In conjunction with our annual test of goodwill in 2002, we recorded an additional impairment charge of $2 million related to our Mail Technologies business, resulting in total goodwill impairment of $74 million for 2002. Our annual impairment tests performed in 2003 and 2004 resulted in no goodwill impairment. As of December 31, 2004, our recorded goodwill was $1.255 billion. Self-Insurance Accruals—We self-insure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims, automotive liability, health and welfare, and general business liabilities, up to certain limits. Insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Recorded balances are based on reserve levels determined by outside actuaries, who incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. Trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves. We believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate, but actual experience in claim frequency and/or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations. Pension and Postretirement Medical Benefits—The Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” and Statement of Financial 34 Accounting Standards No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions.” These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, rate of compensation increases, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuaries and other advisors and information as to historical experience and performance. Differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. Financial Instruments—As discussed in Notes 2, 3, 8, and 16 to our consolidated financial statements, and in the “Market Risk” section of this report, we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk. Certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Fair values are based on listed market prices, when such prices are available. To the extent that listed market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations. Certain financial instruments, including over-the-counter derivative instruments, are valued using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual and market prices, correlations, time value, credit spreads, and yield curve volatility factors. Changes in the fixed income, equity, foreign exchange, and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our results of operations. Depreciation, Residual Value, and Impairment of Fixed Assets—As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $14.0 billion of net fixed assets, the most significant category of which is aircraft. In accounting for fixed assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets. In estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft, we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types. Subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program, changes in the utilization of the aircraft, governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary. Adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense. When appropriate, we evaluate our fixed assets for impairment. Factors that would indicate potential impairment may include, but are not limited to, a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. In December 2003, we permanently removed from service a number of Boeing 727 and McDonnell Douglas DC-8 aircraft. As a result, we conducted an impairment evaluation, which resulted in a $75 million impairment charge during the fourth quarter for these aircraft (including the related engines), $69 million of which impacted the U.S. domestic package segment and $6 million of which impacted the international package segment. In December 2004, we permanently removed from service a number of Boeing 727, 747 and McDonnell Douglas DC-8 aircraft. As a result of the actual and planned retirement of these aircraft, we conducted an impairment evaluation, which resulted in a $110 million impairment charge during the fourth quarter for these aircraft (including the related engines and parts), $91 million of which impacted the U.S. domestic package segment and $19 million of which impacted the international package segment. These charges are classified in the caption “other expenses” within other operating expenses (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements). UPS continues to operate all of its other aircraft and continues to experience positive cash flow. Income Taxes—We operate in numerous countries around the world and are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions. We estimate our annual effective income tax rate based on statutory income tax rates in these jurisdictions and taking into consideration items that are treated differently for financial reporting and tax 35 purposes. The process of estimating our effective income tax rate involves judgments related to tax planning and expectations regarding future events. The increasing profitability of our International segment increases the significance of our non-U.S. income tax provision to our overall effective income tax rate. We recognize deferred tax assets for items that will generate tax deductions or credits in future years. Realization of deferred tax assets requires sufficient future taxable income (subject to any carry-forward limitations) in the applicable jurisdictions. We make judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets based, in part, on estimates of future taxable income. A valuation allowance is established for the portion, if any, of the deferred tax assets that we conclude cannot be realized. Income tax related contingency matters also affect our effective income tax rate. In this regard, we make judgments related to the identification and quantification of income tax related contingency matters. Forward-Looking Statements “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and other parts of this report contain “forward-looking” statements about matters that inherently are difficult to predict. The words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “we see,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements include statements regarding our intent, belief and current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects and future results. We have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Risk Factors The following are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forward-looking statements: • The effect of general economic and other conditions in the markets in which we operate, both in the United States and internationally. Our operations in international markets are also affected by currency exchange and inflation risks. • The impact of competition on a local, regional, national, and international basis. Our competitors include the postal services of the U.S. and other nations, various motor carriers, express companies, freight forwarders, air couriers and others. Our industry is undergoing rapid consolidation, and the combining entities are competing aggressively for business. • The impact of complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, labor, employment and other governmental laws and regulations, and the impact of new laws and regulations that may result from increased security concerns following the events of September 11, 2001. Our failure to comply with applicable laws, ordinances or regulations could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations. • Strikes, work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees. Such actions may affect our ability to meet our customers needs, and customers may do more business with competitors if they believe that such actions may adversely affect our ability to provide service. We may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service. The terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations. • Possible disruption of supplies, or an increase in the prices, of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles as a result of war or other factors. We require significant quantities of fuel and are exposed to the commodity price risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products. • Cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results due to decreased demand for our services. 36 Item 7A.

Ground volume grew 3.4%, and was positively impacted by a solid U.S. economy and our focus on middle market sales initiatives. Next Day Air volume grew 2.8% and deferred volume increased 4.0%, with growth in the manufacturing, business services, telecommunications and retail sectors. The growth in total U.S. Domestic Package volume strengthened throughout the year. Ground revenue per piece increased 3.7% for the year, primarily due to the impact of a rate increase that took effect in 2005, as well as the implementation of a fuel surcharge on ground products. Next Day Air revenue per piece increased 2.0% for the year, primarily due to the rate increase and an increased fuel surcharge rate in 2005 compared to 2004. Next Day Air revenue per piece was adversely affected by relatively higher growth in our Saver product. Both Next Day Air and deferred revenue per piece were adversely affected by lighter average package weights. On January 3, 2005, a rate increase took effect which was in line with previous years’ rate increases. We increased rates 2.9% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, UPS 3 Day Select, and UPS Ground. Other pricing changes included an increase of $0.25 for delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain ZIP codes. The residential surcharge increased $0.10 for UPS Ground services and $0.35 for UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air and UPS 3 Day Select. In January 2005, we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic air services by setting a maximum cap of 9.50%, which was increased to 12.50% effective in October 2005. This fuel surcharge continues to be based on the U.S. Energy Department’s Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was 10.23% in 2005, as compared with 7.07% in 2004. Additionally, an initial fuel surcharge of 2.00% was applied to UPS Ground services in January 2005, which fluctuates based on the U.S. Energy Department’s On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products was 2.90% in 2005. Total domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased by $683 million for the year, due to higher jet and diesel fuel prices, volume increases, and the modifications to our fuel surcharges noted above. These fuel surcharges are used to provide some protection against the increased fuel expense that we incur due to higher fuel prices, as well as the increased purchased transportation expense which is also affected by higher fuel prices. U.S. Domestic Package operating profit increased $791 million, or 21.4%, for the year, and domestic operating margin increased by 200 basis points. Operating profit increased by $274 million due to a change in our Management Incentive Awards program (discussed below in “Operating Expenses”), which also favorably impacted the operating margin. The remaining increase in operating profit and margin resulted from the revenue growth described previously, as well as controlled growth of operating expenses. 2004 compared to 2003 U.S. Domestic Package revenue increased $1.598 billion, or 6.3%, for the year, which resulted from a 3.3% increase in average daily package volume and a 2.1% increase in revenue per piece. Ground volume increased 4.0% during the year, driven in part by the improving U.S. economy, and reflects growth in both commercial and residential deliveries. Ground volume increased 4.8% during the first nine months of the year, but slowed to 1.5% during the fourth quarter. Total Next Day Air volume (up 0.8%) and total deferred volume (down 0.9%) were both significantly affected by declines in letter volume, but offset by an increase in Next Day Air package volume. The 2004 decline in Next Day Air and deferred letter volume is largely due to the slowdown in mortgage refinancing, which was notably strong in 2003. 20 Index to Financial Statements Ground revenue per piece increased 0.9% for the year primarily due to the impact of a rate increase that took effect in 2004, but growth was adversely impacted by approximately 130 basis points due to the removal of the fuel surcharge on ground products, as discussed below. Next Day Air revenue per piece increased 6.6%, while deferred revenue per piece increased 6.0%, primarily due to the shift in product mix from letters to packages, the rate increase, and the modified fuel surcharge on domestic air products. On January 5, 2004, we increased rates for standard ground shipments by an average of 1.9% for commercial deliveries. The ground residential surcharge increased $0.25 to $1.40 over the commercial ground rate. An additional delivery area surcharge of $1.00 was implemented for commercial deliveries in certain ZIP codes. Rates for UPS Hundredweight increased 5.9%. In addition, we increased rates for UPS Next Day Air an average of 2.9% and increased rates for deferred services by 2.9%. In addition, in 2004 we discontinued the fuel surcharge on ground products, while we began to apply a new indexed surcharge to domestic air products. This indexed fuel surcharge for the domestic air products is based on the U.S. Energy Department’s Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge applied to our air products during 2004 was 7.07%, compared with the average surcharge of 1.47% applied to both air and ground products in 2003, resulting in an increase in domestic fuel surcharge revenue of $290 million during the year. U.S. Domestic Package operating profit increased $45 million, or 1.2%, primarily due to the increase in volume and revenue growth discussed previously, but was somewhat offset by increased aircraft impairment charges ($91 million in 2004 compared to $69 million in 2003) and a $63 million pension charge related to the consolidation of data systems used to collect and accumulate plan participant data. Domestic operating margin declined 70 basis points, and was impacted by the aircraft impairment and pension charges noted above, as well as the sale of our Aviation Technologies business unit. During the third quarter of 2003, we sold our Aviation Technologies business unit and recognized a pre-tax gain of $24 million ($15 million after-tax, or $0.01 per diluted share), which is recorded in other operating expenses within the U.S. Domestic Package segment. The operating results of the Aviation Technologies unit were previously included in our U.S. Domestic Package segment, and were not material to our consolidated operating results in any of the periods presented. International Package Operations 2005 compared to 2004 International Package revenue improved $1.168 billion, or 17.2%, for the year, primarily due to the 13.9% volume growth for our export products and revenue per piece improvements. The improvements in revenue per piece were impacted by rate changes, currency fluctuations, and the fuel surcharge applied to international shipments. Revenue increased $121 million during the year due to currency fluctuations, net of hedging activity, and also increased by $133 million during the year due to business acquisitions. In January 2005, we increased rates 2.9% for international shipments originating in the United States, which includes our Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard services. Rate changes for international shipments originating outside the United States vary by geographical market and occur throughout the year. In January 2005, we modified the fuel surcharge on U.S. export products by setting a maximum cap of 9.50%, which was increased to 12.50% effective in October 2005. The fuel surcharge for products originating outside the United States continues to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions, depending upon where the shipment takes place. Total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by $258 million during the year, due to higher jet fuel prices and increased international air volume. 21 Index to Financial Statements Export volume increased throughout the world, with strong growth in Asia and Europe. Asian export volume, which increased 29% for the year, was driven by export growth from China. Asian export volume continues to benefit from our expanding international delivery network, including the additional flights from Shanghai, China that were added in the fourth quarter of 2004, and express air service between the U.S. and Guangzhou, China that began in the second quarter of 2005. European export volume increased 13% for the year, while export volume from the U.S. and Americas also showed solid increases. International domestic volume increased 12.4% for the year, due to volume growth in Canada and Europe, which also benefited from the acquisition of Messenger Service Stolica S.A. in Poland during the second quarter of 2005 and Lynx Express Ltd. in the United Kingdom in the third quarter of 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, international domestic volume increased 3.7%. Export revenue per piece increased 3.1% for the year (1.4% currency-adjusted), due to the rate increases discussed previously and the impact of the fuel surcharge, but was adversely affected by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder product. In total, international average daily package volume increased 13.0% and average revenue per piece increased 4.0% (2.4% currency-adjusted). The improvement in operating profit for our International Package operations was $345 million for the year, or 30.0%, with an increase in the operating margin of 180 basis points. This increase in operating profit and margin was positively impacted by the strong volume growth described previously, as well as better network utilization due to volume growth and geographic service expansion. The increase in operating profit was also favorably affected by $78 million due to the impact of currency fluctuations on revenue and expense (net of hedging activity), and by $45 million due to a change in our Management Incentive Awards program (discussed below in “Operating Expenses”). Operating profit was negatively affected in 2005 by $23 million in currency repatriation losses, as compared with repatriation gains of $32 million in 2004. 2004 compared to 2003 International Package revenue improved $1.200 billion, or 21.4%, for the year primarily due to the 12.5% volume growth for our export products and strong revenue per piece improvements. Revenue increased $295 million during the year due to currency fluctuations. Revenue growth was also impacted by the change to our fuel surcharge (discussed below) as well as rate changes, which vary by geographical market and occur throughout the year. Rates for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service) increased an average of 3.5%. In January 2004, changes were made to the calculation of our fuel surcharge on international products (including U.S. export products). The surcharge began to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions, depending on where the shipment takes place. The surcharge began to be applied only to our international express products, while the previous surcharge was applied to all international products. These changes, along with higher fuel prices, had the effect of increasing International Package revenue by $231 million during the year. We experienced double-digit export volume growth in each region throughout the world, with the Asia-Pacific region leading with 24% export volume growth, including a 101% increase in China export volume. Export volume continued to benefit from our expanding international network, such as the six additional flights to Shanghai, China that were added in the fourth quarter of 2004. European export volume grew in excess of 10%, and was positively influenced by the addition of 10 countries to the European Union during the year. Non-U.S. domestic volume increased 3.7% for the year, and primarily reflected improvements in our European and Canadian domestic delivery businesses. Export revenue per piece increased 8.7% for the year (2.9% currency-adjusted), benefiting from rate increases and the impact of the fuel surcharge. In total, international average daily package volume increased 7.0% and average revenue per piece increased 13.4% (6.5% currency-adjusted). 22 Index to Financial Statements The improvement in operating profit for our International Package operations was $417 million, or 57.0%, for the year, $54 million of which was due to favorable currency fluctuations. The remaining increase in operating profit was primarily due to the solid export volume growth and revenue per piece increases described previously, and a strong 380 basis point increase in operating margin primarily due to better network utilization. International operating profit was adversely affected by aircraft impairment charges of $19 million in 2004, compared to a $6 million charge in 2003. Supply Chain & Freight Operations 2005 compared to 2004 Supply Chain & Freight revenue increased $3.181 billion, or 113.1%, for the year. Forwarding services and logistics revenue increased by $2.358 billion during the year, largely due to the acquisition of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding in December 2004. The growth in our existing forwarding services and logistics businesses (excluding Menlo Worldwide Forwarding) was driven by solid growth in our ocean and ground forwarding operations. Revenue increased by $17 million during the year due to favorable currency fluctuations. Overall growth continues to benefit from the expansion of our freight forwarding network throughout the world, as well as the increase in global trade and the increased outsourcing of manufacturing and distribution. During the third quarter of 2005, we completed our acquisition of Overnite Corp., now known as UPS Freight, which offers a variety of less-than-truckload (LTL) and truckload services to customers in North America. Overnite’s results have been included in the Supply Chain & Freight reporting segment since the August 5, 2005 acquisition date. Overnite generally reported improvements in its operating performance measures in the post-acquisition period versus the same period a year ago when it was not a part of UPS, including improvements in average daily LTL shipments and average LTL revenue per LTL hundredweight. The other businesses within Supply Chain & Freight, which include our retail franchising business, our mail and consulting services, and our financial business, increased revenue by 6.0% during the year. This revenue growth was primarily due to increased revenue at our mail and financial services units. Operating profit for the Supply Chain & Freight segment increased by $18 million, or 13.0%, for the year, largely due to the operating profits generated by Overnite. Operating profit and margin were negatively affected by operating losses incurred in the acquired Menlo Worldwide Forwarding operations, as well as costs incurred in integrating this business into our existing forwarding services business. Currency fluctuations positively affected operating profit by $4 million during the year. Operating profit also was favorably impacted by $15 million due to a change in our Management Incentive Awards program (discussed below in “Operating Expenses”). 2004 compared to 2003 Supply Chain & Freight revenue increased $299 million, or 11.9%, for the year. Freight services and logistics revenue increased by 11.9% during the year, with strong growth in our air and ground freight forwarding businesses, as well as our logistics business. The acquisition of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding, which was completed in December 2004, increased freight services and logistics revenue by $33 million. Favorable currency fluctuations provided $73 million of the increase in revenue for the year. The other businesses within Supply Chain & Freight, which includes our retail franchising business, our mail and consulting services, and our financial business, increased revenue by 11.9% for the year, largely due to strong double-digit franchise and royalty revenue growth at our retail franchising business resulting from an expanding store base. Supply Chain & Freight operating profit increased $82 million, or 146.4%, and operating margin increased by 270 basis points for the year, primarily due to improved results from our financial business (largely due to a lower loan loss provision), and our mail services business, which was affected in 2003 by the sale of our Mail Technologies business unit as described in the next paragraph. Our retail franchising business also experienced profit growth, due to the increased franchise and royalty revenue noted previously. These increases were partially offset by somewhat lower profits at our freight services and logistics operations. 23 Index to Financial Statements During the second quarter of 2003, we sold our Mail Technologies business unit in a transaction that increased net income by $14 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. The gain consisted of a pre-tax loss of $24 million recorded in other operating expenses within the Supply Chain & Freight segment, and a tax benefit of $38 million recognized in conjunction with the sale. The tax benefit exceeded the pre-tax loss from this sale primarily because the goodwill impairment charge we previously recorded for the Mail Technologies business unit was not deductible for income tax purposes. Consequently, our tax basis was greater than our book basis, thus producing the tax benefit described above. The operating results of the Mail Technologies unit were previously included in our Supply Chain & Freight segment, and were not material to our consolidated operating results in any of the periods presented. Operating Expenses 2005 compared to 2004 Consolidated operating expenses increased by $4.845 billion, or 15.3%, for the year, and were significantly impacted by the acquisitions of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding and Overnite. Operating expenses also increased $56 million for the year due to the impact on revenue and expense of currency fluctuations (net of hedging activity) in our International Package and Supply Chain & Freight segments, and increased $55 million for the year due to currency repatriation losses in our International Package segment. Compensation and benefits increased by $1.694 billion, or 8.1%, for the year, largely due to the acquisitions of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding and Overnite, as well as increased health and welfare benefit costs and higher pension expense for our union benefit plans. Stock-based and other management incentive compensation expense decreased $297 million, or 33.4%, in the year, due to a change in our Management Incentive Awards program implemented in 2005, described in the next paragraph, which was partially offset by the impact of prospectively adopting the measurement provisions of FAS 123 beginning with 2003 stock-based compensation awards. During the first quarter of 2005, we modified our Management Incentive Awards program under our Incentive Compensation Plan to provide that half of the annual award be made in restricted stock units (“RSUs”). The RSUs granted in November 2005 under this program have a five-year graded vesting period, with approximately 20% of the total RSU award vesting at each anniversary date of the grant. The other half of the award granted in November 2005 was in the form of cash and unrestricted shares of Class A common stock and was fully vested at the time of grant. Previous awards under the Management Incentive Awards program were made in common stock that was fully vested in the year of grant. This change had the effect of lowering 2005 expense. As a result, 2005 expense for our Management Incentive Awards program (reported in operating expenses under “compensation and benefits”), including the RSUs, decreased $334 million ($213 million after-tax, or $0.19 per diluted share) compared with 2004. Other operating expenses increased by $3.151 billion, or 29.3%, for the year, largely due to the Menlo Worldwide Forwarding and Overnite acquisitions, as well as increases in fuel expense and purchased transportation. The 47.2% increase in fuel expense for the year was impacted by higher prices for jet-A, diesel and unleaded gasoline, as well as higher fuel usage, but was partially mitigated with hedging gains. The 96.7% increase in purchased transportation was primarily due to the Menlo Worldwide Forwarding acquisition, but was also influenced by volume growth in our International Package business and higher fuel prices. The 9.2% increase in repairs and maintenance was largely due to higher expense on vehicle parts (partially affected by the Overnite acquisition), airframe and aircraft engine maintenance. The 6.5% increase in depreciation and amortization for the year was impacted by higher depreciation expense on buildings (largely due to acquisitions), aircraft, and capitalized software. The 16.0% increase in other occupancy expense was largely due to higher facilities rent expense in our Supply Chain & Freight segment, which was impacted by the Menlo Worldwide Forwarding acquisition, and increased utilities expense. The 4.5% increase in other expenses was primarily due to the Overnite acquisition, but partially offset by the absence in 2005 of the $110 million aircraft impairment charge that we incurred in 2004. 24 Index to Financial Statements 2004 compared to 2003 Consolidated operating expenses increased by $2.553 billion, or 8.8%, for the year, $311 million of which was due to currency fluctuations in our International Package and Supply Chain & Freight segments. Compensation and benefits increased by $1.572 billion, or 8.2%, for the year, largely due to increased payroll costs, increased health and welfare expense, and higher pension expense for our union pension plans. Stock-based compensation expense increased $167 million, or 23.2%, during the year, primarily as a result of increased Management Incentive Awards expense and adopting the measurement provisions of FAS 123 prospectively beginning with 2003 stock-based compensation awards. Other operating expenses increased by $981 million, or 10.0%, for the year, largely due to a 34.9% increase in fuel expense and a 12.6% increase in purchased transportation, but were somewhat offset by a decline in depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in fuel expense was primarily due to higher prices for Jet-A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline, in addition to somewhat higher fuel usage and lower hedging gains. The increase in purchased transportation expense was influenced by the impact of currency, higher fuel prices, and volume growth in our international package business. The decline in depreciation and amortization for the year was impacted by lower depreciation expense on aircraft engines, largely due to the retirement of some older aircraft. The increase in repairs and maintenance expense was affected by increased expense on vehicle parts and airframe and engine maintenance. The increase in other occupancy expense was largely related to higher rent expense, but somewhat offset by lower real estate taxes. The increase in other expenses was affected by the $110 million impairment of aircraft, engines, and parts, as well as the $63 million pension charge discussed previously, in addition to higher advertising costs. Investment Income and Interest Expense 2005 compared to 2004 The increase in investment income of $22 million during the year was primarily due to higher average yields earned caused by the increasing short-term interest rates in the United States, but partially offset by a lower average balance of interest-earning investments, increased equity-method losses on certain investment partnerships, and an investment impairment charge on certain available-for-sale securities. We periodically review our investments for indications of other than temporary impairment considering many factors, including the extent and duration to which a security’s fair value has been less than its cost, overall economic and market conditions, and the financial condition and specific prospects for the issuer. After considering these factors, we recorded an impairment charge of $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 related to several variable rate preferred securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). The $23 million increase in interest expense for the year was primarily due to higher floating interest rates on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps, as well as higher imputed interest expense associated with certain investment partnerships. 2004 compared to 2003 Investment income increased by $64 million during the year, primarily due to a $58 million impairment charge recognized during 2003. During the first quarter of 2003, after considering the continued decline in the U.S. equity markets, we recognized an impairment charge of $58 million, primarily related to our investment in S&P 500 equity portfolios. Investment income also increased in 2004 due to higher interest rates earned on cash balances, but was somewhat offset by increased equity-method losses on certain investment partnerships. The $28 million increase in interest expense during 2004 was primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on variable rate debt and certain interest rate swaps, as well as the impact of currency exchange rates and imputed interest expense associated with certain investment partnerships. The impact of higher interest rates was somewhat offset by lower average debt balances outstanding in 2004 compared to 2003. 25 Index to Financial Statements In December 2003, we redeemed $300 million in cash-settled convertible senior notes at a price of 102.703, and also terminated the swap transaction associated with the notes. The redemption amount paid was lower than the amount recorded for the fair value of the notes at the time of redemption, which, along with the cash settlement received on the swap, resulted in a $28 million non-operating gain recorded in 2003 results. Net Income and Earnings Per Share 2005 compared to 2004 Net income for 2005 was $3.870 billion, a 16.1% increase from the $3.333 billion achieved in 2004, resulting in an 18.4% increase in diluted earnings per share to $3.47 in 2005 from $2.93 in 2004. The increase in net income for 2005 was largely due to higher operating profit for both our U.S. Domestic and International Package segments. Net income was adversely impacted by an increase in our effective tax rate to 36.3% in 2005 from 32.3% in 2004. The lower tax rate in 2004 was impacted by credits to income tax expense totaling $142 million ($0.13 per diluted share) related to various items, including the resolution of certain tax matters, the removal of a portion of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets on net operating loss carryforwards, and an adjustment for identified tax contingency items. Net income in 2004 was adversely impacted by a $70 million after-tax impairment charge ($0.06 per diluted share) on Boeing 727, 747, and McDonnell Douglas DC-8 aircraft, engines, and parts, as well as a $40 million after-tax charge ($0.04 per diluted share) to pension expense resulting from the consolidation of data systems used to collect and accumulate plan participant data. 2004 compared to 2003 2004 net income was $3.333 billion, a 15.0% increase from the $2.898 billion in 2003, resulting in an increase in diluted earnings per share to $2.93 in 2004 from $2.55 in 2003. Net income in 2004 was impacted by the aircraft impairment, pension charge, and tax items discussed previously. Net income in 2003 was favorably impacted by the $14 million after-tax gain ($0.01 per diluted share) on the sale of Mail Technologies, the $15 million after-tax gain ($0.01 per diluted share) on the sale of Aviation Technologies, and the $18 million after-tax gain ($0.02 per diluted share) recognized upon redemption of our $300 million cash-settled senior convertible notes. Net income in 2003 was adversely impacted by the $37 million after-tax investment impairment charge ($0.03 per diluted share) described previously. Net income in 2003 was also favorably impacted by reductions in income tax expense of $116 million ($0.10 per diluted share) due to the resolution of various tax issues with the IRS, a favorable court ruling on the tax treatment of jet engine maintenance costs, and a lower effective state tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net Cash From Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.793, $5.331, and $4.576 billion in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The increase in 2005 operating cash flows compared with 2004 was primarily due to higher net income, but partially offset by higher pension and retirement plan fundings. In 2005, we funded $995 million to our pension and postretirement benefit plans as compared to $585 million in 2004. As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, pension and postretirement health contributions to plan trusts in 2006 are projected to be approximately $828 million. In 2005, we received a $374 million tax refund associated with the 1985-1990 settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) reached previously, primarily on tax matters related to excess value package insurance. In 2004, we received $610 million from a tax settlement with the IRS for tax years 1983-84 and 1991-98. On November 18, 2005, we announced a rate increase and a change in the fuel surcharge that took effect on January 2, 2006. We increased rates 5.5% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, and UPS 3 Day Select, and 26 Index to Financial Statements 3.9% on UPS Ground. We also increased rates 5.5% for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service). Other pricing changes include a new charge for undeliverable packages after three delivery attempts and an increase in rates for proof of delivery features for our Delivery Required and Signature Confirmation services. The residential surcharge increased $0.25 for UPS Ground services and $0.35 for UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air and UPS 3 Day Select. These rate changes are customary, and are consistent with previous years’ rate increases. Additionally, in January 2006 we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic and international air services by reducing by 2% the index used to determine the fuel surcharge. The air fuel surcharge continues to remain subject to a maximum cap of 12.5%. The UPS Ground fuel surcharge continues to fluctuate based on the U.S. Energy Department’s On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. were made throughout the past year and varied by geographic market. Net Cash Used In Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $975 million, $3.638 billion, and $2.742 billion in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The decrease in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to the net sales of marketable securities and short-term investments to fund business acquisitions and the aforementioned benefit plan contributions. In 2005, we spent $1.488 billion on business acquisitions, primarily Overnite Corp., Lynx Express Ltd. in the United Kingdom, Messenger Service Stolica S.A. in Poland, and the express operations of Sinotrans Air Transportation Development Co. Ltd. in China. In 2004, we spent $238 million on business acquisitions, primarily Menlo Worldwide Forwarding, Inc. and the 49% minority interest in Yamato Express Co. in Japan (See Note 7). We expect to make additional payments related to business acquisitions of approximately $50 million during 2006, primarily related to the Sinotrans transaction. We generated cash of $95 and $318 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, due to the sales and customer paydowns of finance receivables, primarily in our leasing, asset-based lending, and receivable factoring businesses. Capital expenditures represent a primary use of cash in investing activities, as follows (in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Buildings and facilities $ 495 $ 547 $ 451 Aircraft and parts 874 829 1,019 Vehicles 456 393 161 Information technology 362 358 316 $ 2,187 $ 2,127 $ 1,947 As described in the “Commitments” section below, we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft, vehicles, equipment and other fixed assets to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth. We fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations. Net Cash Used In Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $4.175, $2.014, and $2.110 billion in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Our primary uses of cash in financing activities have been to repurchase stock, pay dividends, and repay long-term debt. In August 2005, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $2.0 billion for future share repurchases, in addition to the amount remaining under our October 2004 share repurchase authorization. We repurchased a total of 33.9 million shares of Class A and Class B common stock for $2.479 billion in 2005, and 18.1 million shares for $1.310 billion in 2004. As of December 31, 2005, we had $1.338 billion of our share repurchase authorization remaining. We increased our quarterly cash dividend payment to $0.33 per share in 2005 from $0.28 per share in 2004, resulting in an increase in total cash dividends paid to $1.391 billion from $1.208 billion. The declaration of 27 Index to Financial Statements dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other relevant factors. We expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends. During 2005, we repaid $589 million in debt, primarily consisting of paydowns of commercial paper, scheduled principal payments on capital lease obligations, and repayments of debt that was previously assumed with the acquisitions of Lynx Express Ltd. and Overnite Corp. Issuances of debt were $128 million in 2005, and consisted primarily of loans related to our investment in certain equity-method real estate partnerships. We consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non-scheduled repayments of debt. Sources of Credit We maintain two commercial paper programs under which we are authorized to borrow up to $7.0 billion in the United States. We had $739 million outstanding under these programs as of December 31, 2005, with an average interest rate of 4.01%. The entire balance outstanding has been classified as a current liability in our balance sheet. We also maintain a European commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to €1.0 billion in a variety of currencies. There were no amounts outstanding under this program as of December 31, 2005. We maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks. These agreements provide revolving credit facilities of $1.0 billion each, with one expiring on April 20, 2006 and the other on April 21, 2010. Interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90-day LIBOR plus 15 basis points. There were no borrowings under either of these agreements as of December 31, 2005. In August 2003, we filed a $2.0 billion shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the United States. There was approximately $126 million issued under this shelf registration statement at December 31, 2005, all of which consists of issuances under our UPS Notes program. Our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants. These covenants generally require us to maintain a $3.0 billion minimum net worth and limit the amount of secured indebtedness available to the company. These covenants are not considered material to the overall financial condition of the company, and all covenant tests were satisfied as of December 31, 2005. Commitments We have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of operating leases, capital leases, debt obligations, purchase commitments, and certain other liabilities. We intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2005 (in millions): Year Capitalized Leases Operating Leases Debt Principal Purchase Commitments OtherLiabilities 2006 $ 64 $ 403 $ 774 $ 1,280 $ 48 2007 107 348 70 826 68 2008 115 248 37 738 69 2009 66 176 104 652 65 2010 61 126 30 478 62 After 2010 1 544 2,637 689 285 Total $ 414 $ 1,845 $ 3,652 $ 4,663 $ 597 28 Index to Financial Statements During 2005, we took delivery of six Boeing MD-11 aircraft and seven Airbus A300-600 aircraft. The final six firm Airbus A300-600 aircraft are scheduled for delivery by July 2006. We have firm commitments to purchase 13 Boeing MD-11 aircraft, and we expect to take delivery of these aircraft during 2006 and 2007. In 2005, we made firm commitments to purchase eight Boeing 747-400F aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2007 and 2008, and two Boeing 747-400SF aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2008. In addition, we have a firm commitment to purchase 10 Airbus A380 aircraft and options to purchase 10 additional A380 aircraft. The A380 aircraft deliveries are scheduled between 2009 and 2012. These aircraft purchase orders will provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth. As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $2.095 billion issued in connection with routine business requirements. As of December 31, 2005, we had unfunded loan commitments totaling $416 million associated with our financial business. We believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long-term needs for the operation of our business, including anticipated capital expenditures, such as commitments for aircraft purchases, for the foreseeable future. Contingencies We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various class-action allegations under state wage-and-hour laws. In one of these cases, Marlo v. UPS, which has been certified as a class action in a California federal court, plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime, and seek penalties for missed meal and rest periods, and interest and attorneys’ fees. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of 1,200 full-time supervisors. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these cases. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. With the assistance of outside counsel, we have undertaken an internal investigation of certain conduct within our Supply Chain Solutions subsidiary in certain locations outside the United States. Our investigation has determined that certain conduct, which commenced prior to our subsidiary’s 2001 acquisition of a freight forwarding business that was part of Fritz Companies Inc., may have violated the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Our investigation also determined that a small number of former employees directed the conduct in question. The monetary value involved in this conduct appears to be immaterial. We have implemented numerous remediation steps, and our investigation continues. In March 2006 we informed the SEC and the Department of Justice of our investigation, and we intend to cooperate fully with any review by the government of these issues. We do not believe that the results of this investigation, the remediation or related penalties, if any, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, nor do we believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. We participate in a number of trustee-managed multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. Several factors could result in potential funding deficiencies which could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in demographics, and increased benefits to participants. At this time, we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions, if any, or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity would result from our participation in these plans. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 241,000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood 29 Index to Financial Statements of Teamsters (“Teamsters”). These agreements run through July 31, 2008. The majority of our pilots are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association, which became amendable December 31, 2003. Negotiations are ongoing with the assistance of the National Mediation Board. Our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727, which becomes amendable on November 1, 2006. In addition, the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. These agreements run through July 31, 2009. Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. All of these market risks arise in the normal course of business, as we do not engage in speculative trading activities. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we utilize a variety of foreign exchange, interest rate, equity and commodity forward contracts, options, and swaps. The following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk. We utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates, interest rate yield curves, and commodity and equity prices. For options and instruments with non-linear returns, models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts. There are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. A discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to an increase in the prices of refined fuels, principally jet-A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline, which are used in the transportation of packages. Additionally, we are exposed to an increase in the prices of other energy products, primarily natural gas and electricity, used in our operating facilities throughout the world. We use a combination of options, swaps, and futures contracts to provide some protection from rising fuel and energy prices. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted fuel and energy consumption for periods of one to three years. The net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 was an asset of $192 and $101 million, respectively. The potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $35 and $32 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, operating expenses, and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate. We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and the Canadian Dollar. We use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods up to one year. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the net fair value of the hedging instruments 30 Index to Financial Statements described above was an asset (liability) of $52 and $(28) million, respectively. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $65 and $117 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates. Exchange rates rarely move in the same direction. The assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. Interest Rate Risk As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, we have issued debt instruments, including debt associated with capital leases, that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest. We use a combination of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. These swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify, and the notional amount, interest payment, and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt. Our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short-term (primarily LIBOR) interest rates. The potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in short-term interest rates applied to our floating rate debt and swap instruments at both December 31, 2005 and 2004 would be approximately $29 million. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we have certain investments in debt, auction rate, and preferred securities that accrue income at variable rates of interest. The potential change in annual investment income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our investments exposed to variable interest rates at December 31, 2005 and 2004 would be approximately $14 and $45 million, respectively. Additionally, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest. The potential change in the annual income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our variable rate finance receivables at December 31, 2005 and 2004 would be immaterial. This interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios, these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts. We adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions. Equity Price Risk We hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk, and for certain of these securities, we utilize options to hedge this price risk. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the fair value of such investments was $89 and $77 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of such investments, assuming a 10% change in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges, would be approximately $9 and $8 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004. Credit Risk The forward contracts, swaps, and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. However, we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines. We do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default. 31 Index to Financial Statements New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“FAS 123(R)”), which replaces FAS 123 and supercedes APB 25. FAS 123(R) requires all share-based awards to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be measured based on their fair values and expensed over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (the vesting period). We had previously adopted the fair value recognition provisions of the original FAS 123, prospectively for all new stock compensation awards granted to employees subsequent to January 1, 2003. FAS 123(R) was effective beginning with the first interim or annual period after June 15, 2005; the SEC deferred the effective date, and as a result, we adopted FAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006. On that date, there were no unvested stock options or other forms of employee stock compensation issued prior to January 1, 2003. We issue employee share-based awards, under our Incentive Compensation Plan, that are subject to specific vesting conditions; generally, the awards cliff vest or vest ratably over a five year period, “the nominal vesting period,” or at the date the employee retires (as defined by the plan), if earlier. For awards that specify an employee vests in the award upon retirement, we account for the awards using the nominal vesting period approach. Under this approach, we record compensation expense over the nominal vesting period. If the employee retires before the end of the nominal vesting period, any remaining unrecognized compensation expense is recorded at the date of retirement. Upon our adoption of FAS 123(R), we will revise our approach to apply the non-substantive vesting period approach to all new share-based compensation awards. Under this approach, compensation cost will be recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, if that is expected to occur during the nominal vesting period. We will continue to apply the nominal vesting period approach for any awards granted prior to January 1, 2006, and for the remaining portion of the then unvested outstanding awards. If we had accounted for all share-based compensation awards granted prior to January 1, 2006 under the non-substantive vesting period approach, the impact to our net income and earnings per share would have been immaterial for all prior periods. The adoption of the non-substantive vesting period approach is expected to reduce 2006 net income by an estimated $29 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, based on share-based awards that we are anticipating granting in 2006. The adoption of the following recent accounting pronouncements did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition: • FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations”; • EITF 05-6, “Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements”; and • FASB Statement No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity”. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As indicated in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles. We base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates, which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements. While estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts, we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. 32 Index to Financial Statements Contingencies—As discussed in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies. We have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies” (“FAS 5”). FAS 5 requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency. The actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates. If a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate, a future charge to income would result. Likewise, if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate, a future credit to income would result. The events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable. At the time a contingency is identified, we consider all relevant facts as part of our FAS 5 evaluation. We record a liability for a loss that meets the recognition criteria of FAS 5. These criteria require recognition of a liability when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable. Events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability. These factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. Contingent losses that meet the recognition criteria under FAS 5, excluding those related to income taxes and self insurance which are discussed further below, were not material to the Company’s financial position as of December 31, 2005. In addition, we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of December 31, 2005, because a loss is not reasonably estimable. Goodwill Impairment—We account for goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“FAS 142”), which requires annual impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units. Goodwill impairment testing requires that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet. We use a discounted cash flow model (DCF model) to estimate the fair value of our goodwill. The completion of the DCF model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows. These assumptions include projections of future revenue, costs and working capital changes. In addition, we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables, as required, in estimating the fair value of our reporting units. The projections that we use in our DCF model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units. As of December 31, 2005, our recorded goodwill was $2.549 billion, of which $2.259 billion relates to our Supply Chain and Freight segment. This segment of our business has experienced rapid growth over the last several years, largely due to a number of acquisitions that we have made. Because of its growth, this segment continues to experience significant change as we integrate the acquired companies, resulting in higher volatility in our DCF model projections than for our other segments. Our annual impairment tests performed in 2005, 2004 and 2003 resulted in no goodwill impairment. Self-Insurance Accruals—We self-insure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims, automotive liability, health and welfare, and general business liabilities, up to certain limits. Insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Recorded balances are based on reserve levels determined by outside actuaries, who incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. Trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves. We believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate, but actual experience in claim frequency and/or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations. Workers compensation, automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle. Consequently, actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time 33 Index to Financial Statements the claim remains open, trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. Changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our self-insurance accruals. All of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. We sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees. We use estimates from third party actuaries to establish the liabilities for these plans. These liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans, anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation. Actual results may differ from these estimates and, therefore, produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. Pension and Postretirement Medical Benefits—Our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions.” These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, rate of compensation increases, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuaries and other advisors and information as to historical experience and performance. Differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. A 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate, expected return on assets, and health care cost trend rate for the pension and postretirement benefit plans would result in the following increases (decreases) on the Company’s costs and obligations for the year 2005 (in millions): 25 Basis Point Increase 25 Basis Point Decrease Pension Plans Discount Rate: Effect on net periodic benefit cost $ (54 ) $ 55 Effect on projected benefit obligation (548 ) 571 Return on Assets: Effect on net periodic benefit cost (26 ) 26 Postretirement Medical Plans Discount Rate: Effect on net periodic benefit cost (5 ) 5 Effect on projected benefit obligation (77 ) 79 Health Care Cost Trend Rate: Effect on net periodic benefit cost 3 (2 ) Effect on projected benefit obligation 22 (14 ) Financial Instruments—As discussed in Notes 2, 3, 8, and 16 to our consolidated financial statements, and in the “Market Risk” section of this report, we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk. Certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Fair values are based on listed market prices, when such prices are available. To the extent that listed market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations. Certain financial instruments, including over-the-counter derivative instruments, are valued using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual and market prices, correlations, time value, credit spreads, and yield curve 34 Index to Financial Statements volatility factors. Changes in the fixed income, equity, foreign exchange, and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our results of operations. A quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices is presented in the “Market Risk” section of this report. Depreciation, Residual Value, and Impairment of Fixed Assets—As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $15.289 billion of net fixed assets, the most significant category of which is aircraft. In accounting for fixed assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets. In estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft, we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types. Subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program, changes in the utilization of the aircraft, governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary. Adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“FAS 144”), we review long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows, or external appraisals, as applicable. We review long-lived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified. The circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include, but are not limited to, a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. In estimating cash flows, we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business. Adverse changes in these volume forecasts, or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections, could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand. This situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type, resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type (thus resulting in increased depreciation expense). In December 2003, we permanently removed from service a number of Boeing 727 and McDonnell Douglas DC-8 aircraft. As a result, we conducted an impairment evaluation, which resulted in a $75 million impairment charge during the fourth quarter for these aircraft (including the related engines), $69 million of which impacted the U.S. domestic package segment and $6 million of which impacted the international package segment. In December 2004, we permanently removed from service a number of Boeing 727, 747 and McDonnell Douglas DC-8 aircraft. As a result of the actual and planned retirement of these aircraft, we conducted an impairment evaluation, which resulted in a $110 million impairment charge during the fourth quarter for these aircraft (including the related engines and parts), $91 million of which impacted the U.S. domestic package segment and $19 million of which impacted the international package segment. These charges are classified in the caption “other expenses” within other operating expenses (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements). UPS continues to operate all of its other aircraft and continues to experience positive cash flow, and no impairments of aircraft were recognized in 2005. Income Taxes—We operate in numerous countries around the world and are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions. We estimate our annual effective income tax rate based on statutory income tax rates in these 35 Index to Financial Statements jurisdictions and take into consideration items that are treated differently for financial reporting and tax purposes. The process of estimating our effective income tax rate involves judgments related to tax planning and expectations regarding future events, including the impact of adjustments, if any, resulting from the resolution of audits of open tax years by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities. We recognize deferred tax assets for items that will generate tax deductions or credits in future years. Realization of deferred tax assets requires sufficient future taxable income (subject to any carry-forward limitations) in the applicable jurisdictions. We make judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets based, in part, on estimates of future taxable income. A valuation allowance is established for the portion, if any, of the deferred tax assets that we conclude cannot be realized. Income tax related contingency matters also affect our effective income tax rate. In this regard, we make judgments related to the identification and quantification of income tax related contingency matters. During 2004 and 2003, the resolution of tax matters with the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities produced reductions in income tax expense of $142 and $77 million, respectively. Forward-Looking Statements “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and other parts of this report contain “forward-looking” statements about matters that inherently are difficult to predict. The words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “we see,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements include statements regarding our intent, belief and current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects and future results. We have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Risk Factors The following are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forward-looking statements: • The effect of general economic and other conditions in the markets in which we operate, both in the United States and internationally. Our operations in international markets are also affected by currency exchange and inflation risks. • The impact of competition on a local, regional, national, and international basis. Our competitors include the postal services of the U.S. and other nations, various motor carriers, express companies, freight forwarders, air couriers and others. Our industry is undergoing rapid consolidation, and the combining entities are competing aggressively for business. • The impact of complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, labor, employment and other governmental laws and regulations, and the impact of new laws and regulations that may result from increased concerns about homeland security. Our failure to comply with applicable laws, ordinances or regulations could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations. • Strikes, work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees. Such actions may affect our ability to meet our customers needs, and customers may do more business with competitors if they believe that such actions may adversely affect our ability to provide service. We may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service. The terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations. 36 Index to Financial Statements • Possible disruption of supplies, or an increase in the prices, of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles as a result of war or other factors. We require significant quantities of fuel and are exposed to the commodity price risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products. • Cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results due to decreased demand for our services. 37 Index to Financial Statements Item 7A.

Volume gains were realized across all products primarily due to a solid U.S. economy, strong small package market and continuing efforts to generate new volume. Overall domestic volume growth moderated in the latter half of 2006 compared with 2005, due to slower overall economic growth in the U.S. and a downturn in industrial production during the fourth quarter. Pricing remained firm as overall revenue per piece was up 2.5% for the year. Ground revenue per piece increased 2.7% and Next Day Air revenue per piece increased 3.3% for the year, primarily due to the impact of a rate increase that took effect in 2006 and the impact of an increased fuel surcharge rate in 2006 compared to 2005. Deferred revenue per piece increased 0.5% for the year for the same reasons, but was adversely affected by the growth in lighter weight, lower revenue packages. On January 2, 2006, a rate increase took effect which was in line with previous years’ rate increases. We increased rates 5.5% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, and UPS 3 Day Select, and 3.9% on UPS Ground. Other pricing changes included a new charge for undeliverable packages after three delivery attempts and an increase in rates for proof of delivery features for our Delivery Required and Signature Confirmation services. The residential surcharge increased $0.25 for UPS Ground services and $0.35 for UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air and UPS 3 Day Select. In January 2006, we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%. The air fuel surcharge was subject to a maximum cap of 12.50% through June 4, 2006. Effective June 5, 2006, we reduced the index by another 2% and no longer applied a cap to the air fuel surcharge. This fuel surcharge continues to be based on the U.S. Energy Department’s Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was 14.02% in 2006, as compared with 10.23% in 2005. Additionally, the UPS Ground fuel surcharge continues to fluctuate based on the U.S. Energy Department’s On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products was 4.13% in 2006, as compared to 2.86% in 2005. Total domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased by $542 million in 2006, due to higher jet and diesel fuel prices, volume growth, and the modifications to our fuel surcharges noted above. These fuel surcharges are used to provide some protection against the increased fuel expense that we incur due to higher fuel prices, as well as the increased purchased transportation expense which is also affected by higher fuel prices. U.S. Domestic Package operating profit increased $430 million, or 9.6%, for the year, and the operating margin increased by approximately 50 basis points to 16.2%. This increase was primarily a result of the revenue growth described previously, combined with efficiencies from leveraging our integrated ground and air networks. The 2006 operating profit for our U.S. Domestic Package segment was negatively impacted by a tentative settlement of a class action litigation (see “Contingencies” section below), which resulted in an $87 million charge to expense. The expense associated with our self-insurance accruals for workers’ compensation claims, automotive liability and general business liabilities was $83 million less in 2006 compared with 2005. Insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Recorded balances are based on ultimate reserve levels determined by outside actuaries, who incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. The lower expense reflects favorable claims experience resulting from company initiatives put into place over the last several years and other factors, including initiatives to decrease accident frequencies, improved oversight and management of claims, improved trends in health care costs, and favorable state legislative reforms, primarily in California. 23 Index to Financial Statements 2005 compared to 2004 U.S. Domestic Package revenue increased $1.650 billion, or 6.1%, for the year, primarily due to a 3.4% increase in average daily package volume and a 2.5% increase in revenue per piece. Ground volume grew 3.4%, and was positively impacted by a solid U.S. economy and our focus on middle market sales initiatives. Next Day Air volume grew 2.8% and deferred volume increased 4.0%, with growth in the manufacturing, business services, telecommunications and retail sectors. The growth in total U.S. Domestic Package volume strengthened throughout the year. Ground revenue per piece increased 3.7% for the year, primarily due to the impact of a rate increase that took effect in 2005, as well as the implementation of a fuel surcharge on ground products. Next Day Air revenue per piece increased 2.0% for the year, primarily due to the rate increase and an increased fuel surcharge rate in 2005 compared to 2004. Next Day Air revenue per piece was adversely affected by relatively higher growth in our Saver product. Both Next Day Air and deferred revenue per piece were adversely affected by lighter average package weights. On January 3, 2005, a rate increase took effect which was in line with previous years’ rate increases. We increased rates 2.9% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, UPS 3 Day Select, and UPS Ground. Other pricing changes included an increase of $0.25 for delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain ZIP codes. The residential surcharge increased $0.10 for UPS Ground services and $0.35 for UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air and UPS 3 Day Select. In January 2005, we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic air services by setting a maximum cap of 9.50%, which was increased to 12.50% effective in October 2005. This fuel surcharge continued to be based on the U.S. Energy Department’s Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was 10.23% in 2005, as compared with 7.07% in 2004. Additionally, an initial fuel surcharge of 2.00% was applied to UPS Ground services in January 2005, which fluctuated based on the U.S. Energy Department’s On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products was 2.86% in 2005. Total domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased by $683 million for the year, due to higher jet and diesel fuel prices, volume increases, and the modifications to our fuel surcharges noted above. U.S. Domestic Package operating profit increased $791 million, or 21.4%, for the year, and domestic operating margin increased by 200 basis points. Operating profit increased by $274 million due to a change in our Management Incentive Awards program (discussed below in “Operating Expenses”), which also favorably impacted the operating margin. The remaining increase in operating profit and margin resulted from the revenue growth described previously, as well as controlled growth of operating expenses. International Package Operations 2006 compared to 2005 International Package revenue improved $1.112 billion, or 13.9%, for the year, primarily due to the 11.9% volume growth for our export products and the impact of acquisitions completed in 2005. Total international revenue per piece declined slightly for the year due to changes in product mix, as lower-yielding domestic products comprised a larger proportion of overall international volume. The change in revenue was positively affected by $83 million during the year due to currency fluctuations, net of hedging activity. Revenue increased by $247 million during the year due to business acquisitions completed previously. In January 2006, we increased rates 5.5% for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service). Rate changes for international shipments originating outside the United States varied by geographical market and occurred throughout the year. 24 Index to Financial Statements Also in January 2006, we modified the fuel surcharge on certain U.S.-related international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%. The air fuel surcharge continued to remain subject to a maximum cap of 12.5% through June 4, 2006. Effective June 5, 2006, we reduced the index by another 2% and no longer applied a cap to the air fuel surcharge. The fuel surcharge for products originating outside the United States continues to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions, depending upon where the shipment takes place. Total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by $189 million during the year due to higher jet fuel prices and increased international air volume. Export volume increased throughout the world, with solid volume increases in Europe, Asia, and U.S. export products. Asian export volume continues to benefit from geographic service expansion and strong economic growth in Asia, while European export volume gains are impacted by our growing transborder business and the expansion of the European Union. International domestic volume increased 21.0% for the year, due to volume growth in Canada and Europe, which also benefited from the acquisition of Stolica in Poland during the second quarter of 2005 and the acquisition of Lynx in the U.K. during the third quarter of 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, international domestic volume and revenue increased 6.9% and 8.3%, respectively, for the year. Export revenue per piece increased 0.5% for the year, largely due to the rate increases discussed previously, the impact of the fuel surcharge, and currency fluctuations, partially offset by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder products. For the year, total international average daily package volume increased 17.3%, while average revenue per piece decreased 2.2% (decreased 3.3% currency-adjusted). The improvement in operating profit for our International Package segment was $216 million for the year, or 14.5%, and the operating margin increased 10 basis points to 18.8%. The increases in operating profit and margin were driven by the volume and revenue growth described previously. The change in operating profit was also positively affected by $26 million during the year due to currency fluctuations. 2005 compared to 2004 International Package revenue improved $1.168 billion, or 17.2%, for the year, primarily due to the 13.9% volume growth for our export products and revenue per piece improvements. The improvements in revenue per piece were impacted by rate changes, currency fluctuations, and the fuel surcharge applied to international shipments. Revenue increased $121 million during the year due to currency fluctuations, net of hedging activity, and also increased by $133 million during the year due to business acquisitions. In January 2005, we increased rates 2.9% for international shipments originating in the United States, which includes our Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard services. Rate changes for international shipments originating outside the United States varied by geographical market and occured throughout the year. In January 2005, we modified the fuel surcharge on U.S. export products by setting a maximum cap of 9.50%, which was increased to 12.50% effective in October 2005. The fuel surcharge for products originating outside the United States continued to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions, depending upon where the shipment takes place. Total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by $246 million during the year, due to higher jet fuel prices and increased international air volume. Export volume increased throughout the world, with strong growth in Asia and Europe. Asian export volume, which increased 29% for the year, was driven by export growth from China. Asian export volume continues to benefit from our expanding international delivery network, including the additional flights from Shanghai, China that were added in the fourth quarter of 2004, and express air service between the U.S. and Guangzhou, China that began in the second quarter of 2005. European export volume increased 13% for the year, while export volume from the U.S. and Americas also showed solid increases. International domestic volume 25 Index to Financial Statements increased 12.4% for the year, due to volume growth in Canada and Europe, which also benefited from the acquisition of Messenger Service Stolica S.A. in Poland during the second quarter of 2005 and Lynx Express Ltd. in the United Kingdom in the third quarter of 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, international domestic volume increased 3.7%. Export revenue per piece increased 3.1% for the year (1.4% currency-adjusted), due to the rate increases discussed previously and the impact of the fuel surcharge, but was adversely affected by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder product. In total, international average daily package volume increased 13.0% and average revenue per piece increased 4.0% (2.4% currency-adjusted). The improvement in operating profit for our International Package operations was $345 million for the year, or 30.0%, with an increase in the operating margin of 180 basis points. This increase in operating profit and margin was positively impacted by the strong volume growth described previously, as well as better network utilization due to volume growth and geographic service expansion. The increase in operating profit was also favorably affected by $78 million due to the impact of currency fluctuations on revenue and expense (net of hedging activity), and by $45 million due to a change in our Management Incentive Awards program (discussed below in “Operating Expenses”). Operating profit was negatively affected in 2005 by $23 million in currency repatriation losses, as compared with repatriation gains of $32 million in 2004. Supply Chain & Freight Operations 2006 compared to 2005 Supply Chain & Freight revenue increased $2.008 billion, or 33.5%, for the year. UPS Freight, formerly known as Overnite Corp., provided $1.155 billion of the increase in revenue for the year. Excluding the impact of the Overnite acquisition in August 2005, segment revenues grew 16.4% for the year. Total average daily LTL shipments for UPS Freight in 2006 declined against the full year 2005 (both the pre and post-acquisition period) due to service issues caused by the integration of the UPS Freight business, as well as a weakening in the overall LTL market in the United States in the latter half of 2006. LTL revenue per LTL hundredweight increased as we proactively reduced less profitable accounts and focused on higher yielding customer segments. Forwarding and logistics revenue increased $822 million, or 16.9% for the year, largely due to continued changes in the business model for this unit. The forwarding and logistics business is moving towards a model that places more transactional ownership risk on UPS, including increased utilization of UPS-owned assets. This has the effect of increasing revenue as well as purchased transportation expense. The increased revenue associated with these forwarding transactions was somewhat offset by certain revenue management initiatives, which involved reducing less profitable accounts. In addition, revenue increased by $29 million during the year due to currency fluctuations. The other businesses within Supply Chain & Freight, which include our retail franchising business and our financial business, increased revenue by 9.2% during the year. This revenue growth was primarily due to increased financial services revenue, as well as revenue earned from our previously-announced contract to provide domestic air transportation for the U.S. Postal Service. For the year, the Supply Chain & Freight segment reported $2 million in operating profit, as compared with a $156 million in operating profit for 2005. These results were impacted by the integration of the acquired Menlo Worldwide Forwarding business into our air network, and the integration of the Motor Cargo business unit within the acquired Overnite Corp. operations into the UPS Freight network. The UPS Freight integration led to service issues, which resulted in a loss of revenue, as well as productivity setbacks resulting in increased costs. The integration of the Menlo Worldwide Forwarding business resulted in increased costs and some lost sales resulting from customer turnover. The increase in operating profit was positively affected by $2 million during 2006 due to the impact of currency fluctuations on revenue and expense. 26 Index to Financial Statements In an effort to rationalize our cost structure and focus on profitable revenue growth, we initiated a restructuring plan for our forwarding and logistics operations in the fourth quarter of 2006. This restructuring plan is expected to generate efficiencies resulting in improved operating profits by further integrating all of our transportation services to better serve our customers. This restructuring involves plans to reduce non-operating expenses by approximately 20%, including a reduction in non-operating staff of approximately 1,400 people. As of December 31, 2006, $12 million in costs have been accrued related to employee severance. 2005 compared to 2004 Supply Chain & Freight revenue increased $3.181 billion, or 113.1%, for the year. Forwarding services and logistics revenue increased by $2.383 billion during the year, largely due to the acquisition of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding in December 2004. The growth in our existing forwarding services and logistics businesses (excluding Menlo Worldwide Forwarding) was driven by solid growth in our ocean and ground forwarding operations. Revenue increased by $17 million during the year due to favorable currency fluctuations. Overall growth continues to benefit from the expansion of our freight forwarding network throughout the world, as well as the increase in global trade and the increased outsourcing of manufacturing and distribution. During the third quarter of 2005, we completed our acquisition of Overnite Corp., now known as UPS Freight, which offers a variety of LTL and truckload services to customers in North America. Overnite’s results have been included in the Supply Chain & Freight reporting segment since the August 5, 2005 acquisition date. Overnite generally reported improvements in its operating performance measures in the post-acquisition period versus the same period a year ago when it was not a part of UPS, including improvements in average daily LTL shipments and average LTL revenue per LTL hundredweight. The other businesses within Supply Chain & Freight, which include our retail franchising business, our mail and consulting services, and our financial business, increased revenue by 0.3% during the year. This revenue growth was primarily due to increased revenue at our mail and financial services units. Operating profit for the Supply Chain & Freight segment increased by $18 million, or 13.0%, for the year, largely due to the operating profits generated by Overnite. Operating profit and margin were negatively affected by operating losses incurred in the acquired Menlo Worldwide Forwarding operations, as well as costs incurred in integrating this business into our existing forwarding services business. Currency fluctuations positively affected operating profit by $4 million during the year. Operating profit also was favorably impacted by $15 million due to a change in our Management Incentive Awards program (discussed below in “Operating Expenses”). Operating Expenses 2006 compared to 2005 Consolidated operating expenses increased by $4.474 billion, or 12.3%, for the year, and were significantly impacted by the acquisitions of Overnite, Stolica, and Lynx. Currency fluctuations in our International Package and Supply Chain & Freight segments resulted in operating expenses increasing by $84 million for the year. Compensation and benefits increased by $1.904 billion, or 8.5%, for the year, largely due to the acquisitions mentioned above, as well as increased health and welfare benefit costs and higher pension expense. These increases were partially offset by the decline in workers compensation expense, as previously discussed. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, compensation and benefits expense increased 5.1% for the year. Stock-based and other management incentive compensation expense increased $49 million, or 8.0% in 2006, due to the expensing of restricted stock units granted in the fourth quarter of 2005, the impact of a new grant of stock options and restricted performance units in the second quarter of 2006, and the impact of adopting the non-substantive vesting period approach of FAS 123R (discussed further in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). These grants were partially offset by lower accruals for our Management Incentive Awards program in 2006. 27 Index to Financial Statements Other operating expenses increased by $2.570 billion, or 18.5%, for the year, largely due to the acquisitions mentioned above, as well as increases in fuel expense and purchased transportation. The table below indicates the impact of business acquisitions completed in 2005 on the increase in operating expenses by category in 2006. Total % Increase Acquisition Impact % Increase without Acquisitions Other Operating Expenses: Repairs and maintenance 5.3 % 3.0 % 2.3 % Depreciation and amortization 6.3 % 3.1 % 3.2 % Purchased transportation 34.9 % 4.8 % 30.1 % Fuel 27.3 % 7.1 % 20.2 % Other occupancy 7.6 % 4.2 % 3.4 % Other expenses 8.5 % 3.9 % 4.6 % 18.5 % 4.5 % 14.0 % Excluding the effect of acquisitions, the 20.2% increase in fuel expense for the year was impacted by higher prices for jet-A, diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as higher usage, but was partially mitigated by hedging gains. The 30.1% increase in purchased transportation was influenced by volume growth in our International Package business, currency fluctuations, higher fuel prices, increased rail costs, and changes to the freight forwarding business model described previously. The 2.3% increase in repairs and maintenance was largely due to increased expense on airframe and engine repairs. The 3.2% increase in depreciation and amortization for the year was caused primarily by higher depreciation expense on plant equipment, aircraft and engines, and higher amortization expense on intangible assets. The 3.4% increase in other occupancy expense was largely due to higher electricity and other utilities expenses. The increase in other expenses was impacted by several items, including the $87 million tentative settlement of a class action litigation (see “Contingencies” section below). 2005 compared to 2004 Consolidated operating expenses increased by $4.845 billion, or 15.3%, for the year, and were significantly impacted by the acquisitions of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding and Overnite. Operating expenses also increased $56 million for the year due to the impact on revenue and expense of currency fluctuations (net of hedging activity) in our International Package and Supply Chain & Freight segments, and increased $55 million for the year due to currency repatriation losses in our International Package segment. Compensation and benefits increased by $1.694 billion, or 8.1%, for the year, largely due to the acquisitions of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding and Overnite, as well as increased health and welfare benefit costs and higher pension expense for our union benefit plans. Stock-based and other management incentive compensation expense decreased $297 million, or 33.4%, in the year, due to a change in our Management Incentive Awards program implemented in 2005, described in the next paragraph, which was partially offset by the impact of prospectively adopting the measurement provisions of FAS 123 beginning with 2003 stock-based compensation awards. During the first quarter of 2005, we modified our Management Incentive Awards program under our Incentive Compensation Plan to provide that half of the annual award be made in restricted stock units (“RSUs”). The RSUs granted in November 2005 under this program have a five-year graded vesting period, with approximately 20% of the total RSU award vesting at each anniversary date of the grant. The other half of the award granted in November 2005 was in the form of cash and unrestricted shares of Class A common stock and was fully vested at the time of grant. Previous awards under the Management Incentive Awards program were made in common stock that was fully vested in the year of grant. This change had the effect of lowering 2005 expense. As a result, 2005 expense for our Management Incentive Awards program (reported in operating expenses under “compensation and benefits”), including the RSUs, decreased $334 million ($213 million after-tax, or $0.19 per diluted share) compared with 2004. 28 Index to Financial Statements Other operating expenses increased by $3.151 billion, or 29.3%, for the year, largely due to the Menlo Worldwide Forwarding and Overnite acquisitions, as well as increases in fuel expense and purchased transportation. The 47.2% increase in fuel expense for the year was impacted by higher prices for jet-A, diesel and unleaded gasoline, as well as higher fuel usage, but was partially mitigated with hedging gains. The 95.5% increase in purchased transportation was primarily due to the Menlo Worldwide Forwarding acquisition, but was also influenced by volume growth in our International Package business and higher fuel prices. The 9.2% increase in repairs and maintenance was largely due to higher expense on vehicle parts (partially affected by the Overnite acquisition), airframe and aircraft engine maintenance. The 6.5% increase in depreciation and amortization for the year was impacted by higher depreciation expense on buildings (largely due to acquisitions), aircraft, and capitalized software. The 16.0% increase in other occupancy expense was largely due to higher facilities rent expense in our Supply Chain & Freight segment, which was impacted by the Menlo Worldwide Forwarding acquisition, and increased utilities expense. The 4.5% increase in other expenses was primarily due to the Overnite acquisition, but partially offset by the absence in 2005 of the $110 million aircraft impairment charge that we incurred in 2004. Investment Income and Interest Expense 2006 compared to 2005 The decrease in investment income of $18 million during the year was primarily due to a lower average balance of interest-earning investments, due to the timing of cash payments for pension fundings, business acquisitions, and capital expenditures. This was partially offset by a higher average interest rate earned on investments, as well as the absence of any investment impairments during 2006 ($16 million of investment impairments were recognized in 2005, as described below). The $39 million increase in interest expense during the year was primarily due to higher average interest rates on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps, as well as interest expense incurred on debt related to real estate investment partnerships. This was partially offset by slightly lower average debt balances during 2006, as well as higher capitalized interest due to large aircraft contract deposit payments made during the year. 2005 compared to 2004 The increase in investment income of $22 million during the year was primarily due to higher average yields earned caused by the increasing short-term interest rates in the United States, but partially offset by a lower average balance of interest-earning investments, increased equity-method losses on certain investment partnerships, and an investment impairment charge on certain available-for-sale securities. We periodically review our investments for indications of other than temporary impairment considering many factors, including the extent and duration to which a security’s fair value has been less than its cost, overall economic and market conditions, and the financial condition and specific prospects for the issuer. After considering these factors, we recorded an impairment charge of $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 related to several variable rate preferred securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). The $23 million increase in interest expense for the year was primarily due to higher floating interest rates on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps, as well as higher imputed interest expense associated with real estate investment partnerships. Net Income and Earnings Per Share 2006 compared to 2005 Net income for 2006 was $4.202 billion, an 8.6% increase from the $3.870 billion achieved in 2005, resulting in a 11.2% increase in diluted earnings per share to $3.86 in 2006 from $3.47 in 2005. Net income in 2006 benefited from a $52 million reduction in income tax expense ($0.05 impact to diluted earnings per share) 29 Index to Financial Statements due to favorable developments with certain U.S. Federal tax contingency matters involving non-U.S. operations. Diluted earnings per share has increased at a faster rate than the growth in net income due to the reduction in shares outstanding as a result of our ongoing share repurchase program. The increase in net income for 2006 was largely due to higher operating profits for both our U.S. Domestic and International Package segments. 2005 compared to 2004 Net income for 2005 was $3.870 billion, a 16.1% increase from the $3.333 billion achieved in 2004, resulting in an 18.4% increase in diluted earnings per share to $3.47 in 2005 from $2.93 in 2004. The increase in net income for 2005 was largely due to higher operating profit for both our U.S. Domestic and International Package segments. Net income was adversely impacted by an increase in our effective tax rate to 36.3% in 2005 from 32.3% in 2004. The lower tax rate in 2004 was impacted by credits to income tax expense totaling $142 million ($0.13 per diluted share) related to various items, including the resolution of certain tax matters, the removal of a portion of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets on net operating loss carryforwards, and an adjustment for identified tax contingency items. Net income in 2004 was adversely impacted by a $70 million after-tax impairment charge ($0.06 per diluted share) on Boeing 727, 747, and McDonnell Douglas DC-8 aircraft, engines, and parts, as well as a $40 million after-tax charge ($0.04 per diluted share) to pension expense resulting from the consolidation of data systems used to collect and accumulate plan participant data. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net Cash From Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.589, $5.793, and $5.331 billion in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The decrease in 2006 operating cash flows compared with 2005 was primarily due to higher pension and retirement plan fundings, but partially offset by increased net income. In 2006, we funded $1.625 billion to our pension and postretirement benefit plans as compared to $995 million in 2005. As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, pension and postretirement health contributions to plan trusts in 2007 are projected to be approximately $581 million. In 2005, we received a $374 million tax refund associated with the 1985-1990 settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) reached previously, primarily on tax matters related to excess value package insurance. In 2004, we received $610 million from a tax settlement with the IRS for tax years 1983-84 and 1991-98. Additionally, we expect to pay a total of $69 million between 2007 and 2008 related to employees who accepted a recently-announced special voluntary separation opportunity, which is discussed further in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. On November 17, 2006, we announced a rate increase and a change in the fuel surcharge that took effect on January 1, 2007. We increased the base rates 6.9% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, and UPS 3 Day Select, and 4.9% on UPS Ground. We also increased the base rates 6.9% for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service). We increased our Ground Hundredweight rates by an average of 5.9%. Other pricing changes included a $0.10 increase in the residential surcharge, and a $0.75 increase in the charge for undeliverable packages after three delivery attempts. These rate changes are customary, and are consistent with previous years’ rate increases. Additionally, in January 2007 we will modify the fuel surcharge on domestic and U.S.-origin international air services by reducing by 2% the index used to determine the fuel surcharge. The UPS Ground fuel surcharge continues to fluctuate based on the U.S. Energy Department’s On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market. Net Cash Used In Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $2.340 billion, $975 million, and $3.638 billion in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The increased cash used in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to increased capital expenditures and fewer net sales of marketable securities and short-term investments. During 2006, we 30 Index to Financial Statements sold a net $482 million in marketable securities and short-term investments, primarily due to the pension and postretirement medical benefit plan fundings in the third quarter. During 2005, we sold a net $2.752 billion in marketable securities and short-term investments, largely to fund the acquisition of Overnite as well as to make fundings to our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans. In 2005, we spent $1.488 billion on business acquisitions, primarily Overnite Corp., Lynx Express Ltd. in the United Kingdom, Messenger Service Stolica S.A. in Poland, and the express operations of Sinotrans Air Transportation Development Co. Ltd. in China (See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). We generated cash of $68, $95, and $318 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004 respectively, due to the sales and customer paydowns of finance receivables, primarily in our leasing, asset-based lending, and receivable factoring businesses. In the second quarter of 2006, we terminated several energy derivatives and received $229 million in cash, which is reported in other investing activities in the statement of cash flows. These derivatives were designated as hedges of forecasted cash outflows for purchases of fuel products. As these derivatives maintained their effectiveness and qualified for hedge accounting, we anticipate that the gains associated with these hedges will be recognized in income over the original term of the hedges through 2007. Capital expenditures represent a primary use of cash in investing activities, as follows (in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Buildings and facilities $ 720 $ 495 $ 547 Aircraft and parts 1,150 874 829 Vehicles 831 456 393 Information technology 384 362 358 $ 3,085 $ 2,187 $ 2,127 As described in the “Commitments” section below, we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft, vehicles, equipment and other fixed assets to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth. We fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations. Net Cash Used In Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $3.851, $4.175, and $2.014 billion in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Our primary uses of cash in financing activities have been to repurchase stock, pay dividends, and repay long-term debt. In July 2006, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $2.0 billion for future share repurchases, in addition to the amount remaining under our August 2005 share repurchase authorization. We repurchased a total of 32.6 million shares of Class A and Class B common stock for $2.455 billion in 2006 ($2.460 billion reported on statement of cash flows due to timing of settlements), and 33.9 million shares for $2.479 billion in 2005. As of December 31, 2006, we had $936 million of our share repurchase authorization remaining; in February 2007, the Board of Directors approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization to $2.0 billion, which replaced the remaining amounts available under our July 2006 authorization. On February 8, 2007, our Board declared a dividend of $0.42 per share, which is payable on March 6, 2007 to shareowners of record on February 20, 2007. We increased our quarterly cash dividend payment to $0.38 per share in 2006 from $0.33 per share in 2005, resulting in an increase in total cash dividends paid to $1.577 billion from $1.391 billion. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other relevant factors. We expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends. Issuances of debt during 2006 consisted primarily of issuances of commercial paper, UPS Notes, and facility notes and bonds. Repayments of debt consisted primarily of scheduled principal payments on our capital lease obligations and principal payments on debt related to our investment in certain equity-method partnerships. We consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non-scheduled repayments of debt. 31 Index to Financial Statements Sources of Credit We maintain two commercial paper programs under which we are authorized to borrow up to $7.0 billion in the United States. We had $791 million outstanding under these programs as of December 31, 2006, with an average interest rate of 5.20%. The entire balance outstanding has been classified as a current liability in our balance sheet. We also maintain a European commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to €1.0 billion in a variety of currencies. There were no amounts outstanding under this program as of December 31, 2006. We maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks. These agreements provide revolving credit facilities of $1.0 billion each, with one expiring on April 19, 2007 and the other on April 21, 2010. Interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90-day LIBOR plus 15 basis points. There were no borrowings under either of these agreements as of December 31, 2006. In August 2003, we filed a $2.0 billion shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the United States. There was $136 million issued under this shelf registration statement at December 31, 2006, all of which consists of issuances under our UPS Notes program. Our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants. These covenants generally require us to maintain a $3.0 billion minimum net worth and limit the amount of secured indebtedness available to the company. These covenants are not considered material to the overall financial condition of the company, and all covenant tests were satisfied as of December 31, 2006. Commitments We have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases, operating leases, debt obligations, purchase commitments, and certain other liabilities. We intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2006 (in millions), including the Boeing 767-300ER order discussed further below: Year Capital Leases Operating Leases Debt Principal Debt Interest Purchase Commitments OtherLiabilities 2007 $ 75 $ 404 $ 918 $ 196 $ 1,072 $ 67 2008 75 335 27 170 988 78 2009 41 243 83 169 499 74 2010 62 168 30 165 1,022 71 2011 1 119 33 164 1,184 69 After 2011 — 505 2,766 2,849 1,636 270 Total $ 254 $ 1,774 $ 3,857 $ 3,713 $ 6,401 $ 629 Our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft. These lease obligations and commitments, as well as our debt principal obligations, are discussed further in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. The amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixed-rate debt, in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of December 31, 2006. The calculations of debt interest do not take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements. Purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding, the largest of which are orders for aircraft, engines, and parts. We have firm commitments to purchase four Boeing MD-11 aircraft, and we expect to take delivery of these aircraft during 2007. In February 2007, we announced an order for 27 Boeing 767-300ER freighters to be delivered between 2009 and 2012 (this order is 32 Index to Financial Statements reflected in the purchase commitment numbers above). We also have firm commitments to purchase eight Boeing 747-400F aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2007 and 2008, and two Boeing 747-400BCF aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2008. These aircraft purchase orders will provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth. In addition, we currently have a firm commitment to purchase 10 Airbus A380-800 freighter aircraft and options to purchase 10 additional A380-800 aircraft (this order is reflected in the purchase commitment numbers above). In February 2007, we announced that we had signed an agreement with Airbus to set out a timetable for deciding the status of this previous order. The agreement specifies changed delivery dates for the A380-800 and provides for possible termination of the original purchase agreement by either party later in 2007. The revised delivery schedule specifies the delivery dates for the 10 Airbus A380-800’s on order as being between 2012 and 2013, whereas we were originally scheduled to take delivery of the Airbus A380-800 aircraft between 2009 and 2012. The signing of this agreement will have no material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. The contractual payments due under the other liabilities column includes commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships. The commitments above exclude our planned pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions, as we do not have any material funding requirements for our UPS-sponsored pension and postretirement plans as of December 31, 2006. In 2007, we plan to contribute $533 million to our U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans and $48 million to our international pension plans. Our funding policy for U.S. plans is to contribute amounts annually that are at least equal to the amounts required by applicable laws and regulations, or to directly fund payments to plan participants, as applicable. International pension plans will be funded in accordance with local regulations. We have also guaranteed our obligations for certain international pension plans up to a maximum amount of $118 million. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefit plans. As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $2.213 billion issued in connection with routine business requirements. As of December 31, 2006, we had unfunded loan commitments totaling $604 million associated with our financial business. We believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long-term needs for the operation of our business, including anticipated capital expenditures, such as commitments for aircraft purchases, for the foreseeable future. Contingencies We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various class-action allegations under state wage-and-hour laws. In one of these cases, Marlo v. UPS, which has been certified as a class action in a California federal court, plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime, and seek penalties for missed meal and rest periods, and interest and attorneys’ fees. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of 1,200 full-time supervisors. The court granted summary judgment in favor of UPS on all claims and plaintiffs have appealed. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. In another case, Cornn v. UPS, which has been certified as a class action in a California federal court, plaintiffs allege that they were improperly denied wages and/or overtime and meal and rest periods. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of approximately 23,600 drivers and seek back wages, penalties, interest and attorneys’ fees. UPS has agreed in principle to settle this matter in full for a total payment of $87 million. On December 6, 2006, the court granted tentative approval of the settlement. 33 Index to Financial Statements We are named as a defendant in four putative class action lawsuits filed in federal courts, alleging a conspiracy relating to certain surcharges by a number of air cargo carriers. We are not named as a defendant in at least eighty-six related cases that make similar allegations. These cases have been consolidated in a Multi- District Litigation proceeding pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. UPS was not included as a defendant in the amended consolidated complaint on which the Multi-District Litigation is proceeding. In addition, in July 2006, we were named as a defendant in a comparable lawsuit filed in the Ontario (Canada) Superior Court of Justice. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these cases. We are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business. We believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. We participate in a number of trustee-managed multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. Several factors could result in potential funding deficiencies which could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in demographics, and increased benefits to participants. At this time, we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions, if any, or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity would result from our participation in these plans. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 246,000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (“Teamsters”). These agreements run through July 31, 2008. In the third quarter of 2006, we began formal negotiations with the Teamsters on a new agreement. We have approximately 2,800 pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association (“IPA”). On June 30, 2006, UPS and the IPA announced a tentative agreement on a new labor contract, which was ratified in the third quarter. This new contract becomes amendable at the end of 2011. Our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727, which became amendable on November 1, 2006. We began formal negotiations with Teamsters Local 2727 on October 2, 2006. In addition, the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. These agreements run through July 31, 2009. Other Matters On July 14, 2006, we received a grand jury subpoena from the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”). The subpoena relates to the DOJ’s publicly-announced criminal investigation of the air cargo pricing practices of a number of domestic and foreign airlines. We do not believe that we are a target of this investigation and we intend to cooperate. With the assistance of outside counsel, we investigated certain conduct within our Supply Chain Solutions subsidiary in certain locations outside the United States. Our investigation determined that certain conduct, which commenced prior to our subsidiary’s 2001 acquisition of a freight forwarding business that was part of Fritz Companies Inc., may have violated the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The monetary value involved in this conduct appears to be immaterial. We have implemented numerous remediation steps. We informed the SEC and the DOJ of our investigation, and we intend to cooperate fully with any review by the government of these issues. We do not believe that the results of this investigation, the remediation or related penalties, if any, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, nor do we believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. All of these market risks arise in the normal course of business, as we do not 34 Index to Financial Statements engage in speculative trading activities. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we utilize a variety of foreign exchange, interest rate, equity and commodity forward contracts, options, and swaps. The following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk. We utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates, interest rate yield curves, and commodity and equity prices. For options and instruments with non-linear returns, models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts. There are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. A discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to an increase in the prices of refined fuels, principally jet-A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline, which are used in the transportation of packages. Additionally, we are exposed to an increase in the prices of other energy products, primarily natural gas and electricity, used in our operating facilities throughout the world. We use a combination of options, swaps, and futures contracts to provide some protection from rising fuel and energy prices. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted fuel and energy consumption for periods of one to three years. The net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 was an asset of $10 and $192 million, respectively. The potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $8 and $35 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities. In the second quarter of 2006, we terminated several energy derivatives and received $229 million in cash. These derivatives were designated as hedges of forecasted cash outflows for purchases of fuel products. As these derivatives maintained their effectiveness and qualified for hedge accounting, we anticipate that the gains associated with these hedges will be recognized in income over the original term of the hedges through 2007. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, operating expenses, and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate. We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and the Canadian Dollar. We use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods up to one year. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset of $30 and $52 million, respectively. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $183 and $65 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates. Exchange rates rarely move in the same direction. The assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. 35 Index to Financial Statements Interest Rate Risk As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, we have issued debt instruments, including debt associated with capital leases, that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest. We use a combination of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. These swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify, and the notional amount, interest payment, and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt. Our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short-term (primarily LIBOR) interest rates. The potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in short-term interest rates applied to our floating rate debt and swap instruments at December 31, 2006 and 2005 would be approximately $29 million each year. We have investments in debt and preferred equity securities (including auction rate securities), as well as cash-equivalent instruments, some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest. The potential change in annual investment income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our investments exposed to variable interest rates at December 31, 2006 and 2005 would be approximately $12 and $14 million, respectively. Additionally, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest. The potential change in the annual income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our variable rate finance receivables at December 31, 2006 and 2005 would be immaterial. This interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios, these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts. We adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions. Equity Price Risk We hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk, and for certain of these securities, we utilize options to hedge this price risk. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the fair value of such investments was $80 and $89 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of such investments, assuming a 10% change in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges, would be approximately $8 and $9 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Credit Risk The forward contracts, swaps, and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. However, we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines. We do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default. New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 158 “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R))” (“FAS 158”). This statement requires the recognition of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the balance sheet for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. 36 Index to Financial Statements FAS 158 also requires delayed recognition items, consisting of actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits, to be recognized in other comprehensive income and subsequently amortized to the income statement. On December 31, 2006, we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of FAS 158. The effect of adopting FAS 158 on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 has been included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, while there was no effect on our balance sheet for prior periods. Additionally, we currently utilize the early measurement date option available under Statement No. 87 “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions”, and we measure the funded status of our plans as of September 30 each year. Under the provisions of FAS 158, we will be required to use a December 31 measurement date for all of our pension and postretirement benefit plans no later than 2008. We do not expect the impact of the change in measurement date to have a material impact on our financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109)”. This interpretation was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, financial statement classification, tax-related interest and penalties, and additional disclosure requirements. We are required to adopt this interpretation effective January 1, 2007. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of this standard on our financial statements. Any necessary transition adjustments will not affect net income in the period of adoption and will be reported as a change in accounting principle in our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS 157”), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. FAS 157 was issued to define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value, and expand disclosures about fair value measurements. FAS 157 is not anticipated to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. The adoption of the following recent accounting pronouncements did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition: • FSP AUG AIR-1 “Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities”; • FAS 156 “Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets”; and • FSP FAS 13-2 “Accounting for a Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Related to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction”. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As indicated in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles. We base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates, which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements. While estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts, we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Contingencies— As discussed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies. We have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies” (“FAS 5”). FAS 5 requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency. The actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates. If a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate, a future charge to income would result. Likewise, if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate, a future credit to income would result. 37 Index to Financial Statements The events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable. At the time a contingency is identified, we consider all relevant facts as part of our FAS 5 evaluation. We record a liability for a loss that meets the recognition criteria of FAS 5. These criteria require recognition of a liability when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable. Events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability. These factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. Contingent losses that meet the recognition criteria under FAS 5, excluding those related to income taxes and self insurance which are discussed further below, were not material to the Company’s financial position as of December 31, 2006. In addition, we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of December 31, 2006, because a loss is not reasonably estimable. Goodwill Impairment— We account for goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“FAS 142”), which requires annual impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units. Goodwill impairment testing requires that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet. We use a discounted cash flow model (DCF model) to estimate the fair value of our goodwill. The completion of the DCF model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows. These assumptions include projections of future revenue, costs and working capital changes. In addition, we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables, as required, in estimating the fair value of our reporting units. The projections that we use in our DCF model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units. As of December 31, 2006, our recorded goodwill was $2.533 billion, of which $2.243 billion relates to our Supply Chain and Freight segment. This segment of our business has experienced rapid growth over the last several years, largely due to a number of acquisitions that we have made. Because of its growth, this segment continues to experience significant change as we integrate the acquired companies, resulting in higher volatility in our DCF model projections than for our other segments. Our annual impairment tests performed in 2006, 2005 and 2004 resulted in no goodwill impairment. Self-Insurance Accruals—We self-insure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims, automotive liability, health and welfare, and general business liabilities, up to certain limits. Insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Recorded balances are based on reserve levels determined by outside actuaries, who incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. Trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves. We believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate, but actual experience in claim frequency and/or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations. Workers’ compensation, automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle. Consequently, actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open, trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. Changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our self-insurance accruals. All of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. We sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees. We use estimates from third party actuaries to establish the liabilities for these plans. These liabilities and related expenses are based on 38 Index to Financial Statements estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans, anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation. Actual results may differ from these estimates and, therefore, produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. Pension and Postretirement Medical Benefits—As discussed in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, we maintain several defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans. Our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions.” These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, rate of compensation increases, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuaries and other advisors and information as to historical experience and performance. Differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. A 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate, expected return on assets, and health care cost trend rate for the pension and postretirement benefit plans would result in the following increases (decreases) on the Company’s costs and obligations for the year 2006 (in millions): 25 Basis PointIncrease 25 Basis PointDecrease Pension Plans Discount Rate: Effect on net periodic benefit cost $ (67 ) $ 68 Effect on projected benefit obligation (571 ) 595 Return on Assets: Effect on net periodic benefit cost (31 ) 31 Postretirement Medical Plans Discount Rate: Effect on net periodic benefit cost (7 ) 7 Effect on projected benefit obligation (83 ) 86 Health Care Cost Trend Rate: Effect on net periodic benefit cost 3 (2 ) Effect on projected benefit obligation 17 (16 ) Financial Instruments—As discussed in Notes 2, 3, 8, and 15 to our consolidated financial statements, and in the “Market Risk” section of this report, we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk. Certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Fair values are based on listed market prices, when such prices are available. To the extent that listed market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations. Certain financial instruments, including over-the-counter derivative instruments, are valued using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual and market prices, correlations, time value, credit spreads, and yield curve volatility factors. Changes in the fixed income, equity, foreign exchange, and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our results of operations. A quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices is presented in the “Market Risk” section of this report. Depreciation, Residual Value, and Impairment of Fixed Assets—As of December 31, 2006, we had $16.779 billion of net fixed assets, the most significant category of which is aircraft. In accounting for fixed assets, we 39 Index to Financial Statements make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets. In estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft, we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types. Subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program, changes in the utilization of the aircraft, governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary. Adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“FAS 144”), we review long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows, or external appraisals, as applicable. We review long-lived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified. The circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include, but are not limited to, a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. In estimating cash flows, we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business. Adverse changes in these volume forecasts, or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections, could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand. This situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type, resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type (thus resulting in increased depreciation expense). During 2006, we reevaluated the anticipated service lives of our Boeing 757, Boeing 767, and Airbus A300 fleets, and as a result of this evaluation, increased the depreciable lives from 20 to 30 years and reduced the residual values from 30% to 10% of original cost. This change did not have a material effect on our results of operations. In December 2004, we permanently removed from service a number of Boeing 727, 747 and McDonnell Douglas DC-8 aircraft. As a result of the actual and planned retirement of these aircraft, we conducted an impairment evaluation, which resulted in a $110 million impairment charge during the fourth quarter of 2004 for these aircraft (including the related engines and parts), $91 million of which impacted the U.S. domestic package segment and $19 million of which impacted the international package segment. This charge was classified in the caption “other expenses” on the income statement. UPS continues to operate all of its other aircraft and continues to experience positive cash flow, and no impairments of aircraft were recognized in 2006 or 2005. Income Taxes—We operate in numerous countries around the world and are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions. We estimate our annual effective income tax rate based on statutory income tax rates in these jurisdictions and take into consideration items that are treated differently for financial reporting and tax purposes. The process of estimating our effective income tax rate involves judgments related to tax planning and expectations regarding future events, including the impact of adjustments, if any, resulting from the resolution of audits of open tax years by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities. We recognize deferred tax assets for items that will generate tax deductions or credits in future years. Realization of deferred tax assets requires sufficient future taxable income (subject to any carry-forward limitations) in the applicable jurisdictions. We make judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets based, in part, on estimates of future taxable income. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not (likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Income tax related contingency matters also affect our effective income tax rate. In this regard, we make judgments related to the identification and quantification of income tax related contingency matters. 40 Index to Financial Statements During the third quarter of 2006, we recognized a $52 million reduction of income tax expense related to favorable developments with certain U.S. Federal tax contingency matters involving non-U.S. operations. During 2004, the resolution of tax matters with the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities produced reductions in income tax expense of $142 million. Forward-Looking Statements “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and other parts of this report contain “forward-looking” statements about matters that inherently are difficult to predict. The words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “we see,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements include statements regarding our intent, belief and current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects and future results. We have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Risk Factors The following are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forward-looking statements: • The effect of general economic and other conditions in the markets in which we operate, both in the United States and internationally. Our operations in international markets are also affected by currency exchange and inflation risks. • The impact of competition on a local, regional, national, and international basis. Our competitors include the postal services of the U.S. and other nations, various motor carriers, express companies, freight forwarders, air couriers and others. Our industry is undergoing rapid consolidation, and the combining entities are competing aggressively for business. • The impact of complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, labor, employment and other governmental laws and regulations, and the impact of new laws and regulations that may result from increased security concerns following the events of September 11, 2001. Our failure to comply with applicable laws, ordinances or regulations could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations. • Strikes, work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees. Such actions may affect our ability to meet our customers needs, and customers may do more business with competitors if they believe that such actions may adversely affect our ability to provide service. We may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service. The terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations. • Possible disruption of supplies, or an increase in the prices, of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles as a result of war or other factors. We require significant quantities of fuel and are exposed to the commodity price risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products. • Cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results due to decreased demand for our services. 41 Index to Financial Statements Item 7A.

Next Day Air volume increased 0.8% and Ground volume increased 0.6% for the year, largely as a result of a solid peak season in the fourth quarter, when our Next Day Air volume rose 2.2% and Ground volume increased 1.5%. Deferred air volume declined 1.9% in 2007. Our domestic air and ground products have been impacted by the slowing U.S. economy and weak small package market in 2007. Trends in U.S. industrial production and business-to-consumer shipments in 2007 have not been favorable to the overall small package market, which places pressure on our domestic package volume. The increase in overall revenue per piece of 1.6% in 2007 resulted primarily from a rate increase that took effect earlier in the year, but was negatively impacted by lower fuel surcharge revenue and an unfavorable shift in product mix. Next Day Air revenue per piece declined 0.9%, and was negatively impacted by strong growth in our lower-yielding Next Day Air Saver products. Deferred revenue per piece increased only 0.4%. The change in revenue per piece for all our air products was negatively impacted by a lower fuel surcharge rate (discussed further below). Ground revenue per piece increased 2.9%, primarily due to the rate increase, but was also impacted slightly by a higher fuel surcharge due to higher diesel fuel prices in 2007 compared with 2006. Overall product mix reduced revenue per piece, as our premium air products suffered volume declines while our ground volume grew 0.6%. Consistent with the practice in previous years, a rate increase took effect on January 1, 2007. We increased the base rates 6.9% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, and UPS 3 Day Select, and 4.9% on UPS Ground. Other pricing changes included a $0.10 increase in the residential surcharge, and a $0.75 increase in the charge for undeliverable packages after three delivery attempts. In January 2007, we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%. This fuel surcharge continues to be based on the U.S. Energy Department’s Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was 12.17% in 2007, a decline from the 14.02% in 2006, primarily due to the 2% reduction in the index. The ground fuel surcharge rate continues to fluctuate based on the U.S. Energy Department’s On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products was 4.30% in 2007, an increase from 4.13% in 2006, due to higher diesel fuel prices. As a result of the air products index rate reduction and fuel market price movements, total domestic fuel surcharge revenue decreased by $110 million in 2007. U.S. Domestic Package incurred an operating loss of $1.531 billion in 2007, compared with a $4.923 billion operating profit in 2006, largely due to a $6.100 billion charge related to our withdrawal from the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (“Central States Pension Fund”). Additionally, Domestic Package operating results were negatively impacted by low revenue growth, an aircraft impairment charge, and a special voluntary separation opportunity (“SVSO”) charge. The aircraft impairment and SVSO charges reduced domestic operating profit by $159 million and $53 million, respectively. These factors were partially offset by cost controls, including, among other categories, lower self-insurance expense. The expense associated with our self-insurance 23 accruals for workers’ compensation claims, automotive liability and general business liabilities declined as a result of several factors. The Central States Pension Fund withdrawal, aircraft impairment, and SVSO charges, as well as the impact of lower self-insurance expense, are discussed further in the “Operating Expenses” section. 2006 compared to 2005 U.S. Domestic Package revenue increased $1.846 billion, or 6.5%, for the year, with average daily package volume up 4.4%. Volume gains were realized across all products primarily due to a solid U.S. economy, strong small package market and continuing efforts to generate new volume. Overall domestic volume growth moderated in the latter half of 2006 compared with 2005, due to slower overall economic growth in the U.S. and a downturn in industrial production during the fourth quarter. Pricing remained firm as overall revenue per piece was up 2.5% for the year. Ground revenue per piece increased 2.7% and Next Day Air revenue per piece increased 3.3% for the year, primarily due to the impact of a rate increase that took effect in 2006 and the impact of an increased fuel surcharge rate in 2006 compared to 2005. Deferred revenue per piece increased 0.5% for the year for the same reasons, but was adversely affected by the growth in lighter weight, lower revenue packages. On January 2, 2006, a rate increase took effect which was in line with previous years’ rate increases. We increased rates 5.5% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, and UPS 3 Day Select, and 3.9% on UPS Ground. Other pricing changes included a new charge for undeliverable packages after three delivery attempts and an increase in rates for proof of delivery features for our Delivery Required and Signature Confirmation services. The residential surcharge increased $0.25 for UPS Ground services and $0.35 for UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air and UPS 3 Day Select. In January 2006, we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%. The air fuel surcharge was subject to a maximum cap of 12.50% through June 4, 2006. Effective June 5, 2006, we reduced the index by another 2% and no longer applied a cap to the air fuel surcharge. This fuel surcharge continued to be based on the U.S. Energy Department’s Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was 14.02% in 2006, as compared with 10.23% in 2005. Additionally, the UPS Ground fuel surcharge continued to fluctuate based on the U.S. Energy Department’s On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products was 4.13% in 2006, as compared to 2.86% in 2005. Total domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased by $542 million in 2006, due to higher jet and diesel fuel prices, volume growth, and the modifications to our fuel surcharges noted above. These fuel surcharges are used to provide some protection against the increased fuel expense that we incur due to higher fuel prices, as well as the increased purchased transportation expense which is also affected by higher fuel prices. U.S. Domestic Package operating profit increased $430 million, or 9.6%, for the year, and the operating margin increased by approximately 50 basis points to 16.2%. This increase was primarily a result of the revenue growth described previously, combined with efficiencies from leveraging our integrated ground and air networks. The 2006 operating profit for our U.S. Domestic Package segment was negatively impacted by the settlement of a class action litigation (see “Contingencies” section below), which resulted in an $87 million charge to expense. Operating profit for this segment was positively affected as a result of lower expense associated with our self-insurance accruals for workers’ compensation claims, automotive liability and general business liabilities in 2006 compared with 2005. International Package Operations 2007 compared to 2006 International Package revenue improved $1.192 billion, or 13.1% in 2007, driven by a 10.4% volume increase for our export products and an 8.3% increase in total revenue per piece. The growth in revenue per piece 24 was positively impacted by base rate increases and the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against several major foreign currencies in 2007, but was adversely affected by a lower fuel surcharge rate applied to our U.S. origin international air products. Export volume increased throughout the world. Asian export volume grew strongly in key markets during the year, especially China. Asian export volume continues to benefit from our geographic service expansion, as well as strong economic growth, which benefits our intra-Asian package business. To continue this expansion, we received authority in 2007 to operate six daily flights between the U.S. and Nagoya, Japan. We are also constructing a package and freight air hub in Shanghai, China that is expected to open in 2008. This hub will link Shanghai to our international air network, with direct service to Europe, Asia, and the Americas. European export volume also grew solidly, largely due to continued growth in the transborder business and improved economic and industrial output in the European Union. U.S. export volume increased at a slower pace. Non-U.S. domestic volume increased 2.2% for the year, and was impacted by growth in several major European countries and Canada. Export revenue per piece increased 3.9% for the year, largely due to rate increases and favorable exchange rates, but was adversely impacted by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder products, and a reduction in certain fuel surcharge rates. Non-U.S. domestic revenue per piece increased 9.6% for the year, and was affected by rate increases and favorable exchange rates. Total average revenue per piece increased 2.7% on a currency-adjusted basis, and the overall change in segment revenue was positively affected by $464 million in 2007 due to currency fluctuations, net of hedging activity. In January 2007, we increased rates 6.9% for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service). Rate changes for international shipments originating outside the United States vary by geographical market and occur throughout the year. Also in January 2007, we modified the fuel surcharge on certain U.S.-related international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%. The fuel surcharge for products originating outside the United States continues to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions. Total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by $12 million during the year due to increased volume, but was partially offset by the reduction in the fuel surcharge index. International Package operating profit increased $121 million, or 7.1%, for the year, primarily due to the volume and revenue per piece improvements described above. The change in operating profit was also positively affected by $153 million during the year due to favorable currency exchange rates, net of hedging activity. International Package operating profit was adversely affected in 2007 by charges related to the aircraft impairment ($62 million) and the SVSO ($7 million), both of which are discussed further in the “Operating Expenses” section. Operating profit was negatively impacted by fuel, as the increase in fuel surcharge revenue was more than offset by the increase in fuel expense. The adverse impact of the aircraft impairment, SVSO charge, and fuel were the primary causes of the 100 basis point decline in operating margin to 17.8%. 2006 compared to 2005 International Package revenue improved $1.112 billion, or 13.9%, for the year, primarily due to the 11.9% volume growth for our export products and the impact of acquisitions completed in 2005. Total international revenue per piece declined slightly for the year due to changes in product mix, as lower-yielding domestic products comprised a larger proportion of overall international volume. The change in revenue was positively affected by $83 million during the year due to currency fluctuations, net of hedging activity. Revenue increased by $247 million during the year due to business acquisitions completed previously. 25 In January 2006, we increased rates 5.5% for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service). Rate changes for international shipments originating outside the United States varied by geographical market and occurred throughout the year. Also in January 2006, we modified the fuel surcharge on certain U.S.-related international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%. The air fuel surcharge continued to remain subject to a maximum cap of 12.5% through June 4, 2006. Effective June 5, 2006, we reduced the index by another 2% and no longer applied a cap to the air fuel surcharge. The fuel surcharge for products originating outside the United States continued to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions, depending upon where the shipment took place. Total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by $189 million during the year due to higher jet fuel prices and increased international air volume. Export volume increased throughout the world, with solid volume increases in Europe, Asia, and U.S. export products. Asian export volume continued to benefit from geographic service expansion and strong economic growth in Asia, while European export volume gains were impacted by our growing transborder business and the expansion of the European Union. International domestic volume increased 21.0% for the year, due to volume growth in Canada and Europe, which also benefited from the acquisition of Stolica in Poland during the second quarter of 2005 and the acquisition of Lynx in the U.K. during the third quarter of 2005. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, international domestic volume and revenue increased 6.9% and 8.3%, respectively, for the year. Export revenue per piece increased 0.5% for the year, largely due to the rate increases discussed previously, the impact of the fuel surcharge, and currency fluctuations, partially offset by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder products. For the year, total international average daily package volume increased 17.3%, while average revenue per piece decreased 2.2% (decreased 3.3% currency-adjusted). The improvement in operating profit for our International Package segment was $216 million for the year, or 14.5%, and the operating margin increased 10 basis points to 18.8%. The increases in operating profit and margin were driven by the volume and revenue growth described previously. The change in operating profit was also positively affected by $26 million during the year due to currency fluctuations. Supply Chain & Freight Operations 2007 compared to 2006 Supply Chain & Freight revenue increased $424 million, or 5.3%, in 2007. Forwarding and logistics revenue increased $230 million, or 4.0%, for the year, and was affected by favorable exchange rate movements and revenue management initiatives begun in 2006. Favorable exchange rate movements positively affected the growth in revenue by $178 million during the year. Revenue growth in this business was driven by improvements in international air freight and mail services, which were impacted by overall market growth and lower customer turnover rates. UPS Freight increased revenue $156 million, or 8.0%, for the year as a result of improved yields and a strong increase in average daily shipment volume. Average LTL shipments per day increased 8.3% during the year, driven by new customer wins and leveraging our existing small package customer base for new sales opportunities. LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 9.3% during the year, due to an increase in base rates in 2007 and a focus on higher-yielding customer segments. The increase in revenue per hundredweight and average daily shipments were somewhat offset by a 7.5% decrease for the year in the LTL weight per shipment. The other businesses within Supply Chain & Freight, which include our retail franchising business, our financial business, and our U.S. domestic cargo operations, increased revenue by 10.3% during the year. This revenue growth was primarily due to increased revenue from our contract to provide domestic air transportation services for the U.S. Postal Service. 26 Operating profit for the Supply Chain & Freight segment was $278 million in 2007, compared with a profit of $2 million in 2006, resulting in a 330 basis point improvement in the operating margin. This improvement was largely due to improved results in the forwarding and logistics business as a result of cost controls, a focus on asset utilization, and revenue management initiatives. Cost improvements were realized as a result of the restructuring program that began in 2006, which included a reduction of non-operating staff of approximately 1,400 people. Additionally, margin improvements are being realized by focusing on capacity utilization in the air freight business, through better utilizing space available on our own aircraft. Finally, revenue management initiatives put into place last year are producing better returns through reducing less profitable accounts, and ensuring that new accounts meet specific criteria that allow us to better utilize our existing transportation assets. Operating profit in 2007 for this segment was reduced by $46 million as a result of a charge for restructuring and disposing of certain non-core business units in France, as well as by $8 million due to the SVSO charge. These charges are discussed further in the “Operating Expenses” section. Currency fluctuations positively affected the growth in operating profit by $18 million in 2007. 2006 compared to 2005 Supply Chain & Freight revenue increased $2.008 billion, or 33.5%, for the year. UPS Freight, formerly known as Overnite Corp., provided $1.155 billion of the increase in revenue for the year. Excluding the impact of the Overnite acquisition in August 2005, segment revenues grew 16.4% for the year. Total average daily LTL shipments for UPS Freight in 2006 declined against the full year 2005 (both the pre and post-acquisition period) due to service issues caused by the integration of the UPS Freight business, as well as a weakening in the overall LTL market in the United States in the latter half of 2006. LTL revenue per LTL hundredweight increased as we proactively reduced less profitable accounts and focused on higher yielding customer segments. Forwarding and logistics revenue increased $822 million, or 16.9% for the year, largely due to continued changes in the business model for this unit. The forwarding and logistics business is moving towards a model that places more transactional ownership risk on UPS, including increased utilization of UPS-owned assets. This has the effect of increasing revenue as well as purchased transportation expense. The increased revenue associated with these forwarding transactions was somewhat offset by certain revenue management initiatives, which involved reducing less profitable accounts. In addition, revenue increased by $29 million during the year due to currency fluctuations. The other businesses within Supply Chain & Freight, which include our retail franchising business and our financial business, increased revenue by 9.2% during the year. This revenue growth was primarily due to increased financial services revenue, as well as revenue earned from our previously-announced contract to provide domestic air transportation for the U.S. Postal Service. For the year, the Supply Chain & Freight segment reported $2 million in operating profit, as compared with a $156 million in operating profit for 2005. These results were impacted by the integration of the acquired Menlo Worldwide Forwarding business into our air network, and the integration of the Motor Cargo business unit within the acquired Overnite Corp. operations into the UPS Freight network. The UPS Freight integration led to service issues, which resulted in a loss of revenue, as well as productivity setbacks resulting in increased costs. The integration of the Menlo Worldwide Forwarding business resulted in increased costs and some lost sales resulting from customer turnover. The increase in operating profit was positively affected by $2 million during 2006 due to the impact of currency fluctuations on revenue and expense. In an effort to rationalize our cost structure and focus on profitable revenue growth, we initiated a restructuring plan for our forwarding and logistics operations in the fourth quarter of 2006. This restructuring plan was designed to generate efficiencies, resulting in improved operating profits, by further integrating all of our transportation services to better serve our customers. This restructuring involved the reduction of non-operating expenses by approximately 20%, including a reduction in non-operating staff of approximately 1,400 people. We incurred $12 million in expenses in 2006 related to employee severance. 27 Operating Expenses 2007 compared to 2006 Consolidated operating expenses increased by $8.202 billion, or 20.0%, in 2007 compared with 2006. Currency fluctuations in our International Package and Supply Chain & Freight segments resulted in consolidated operating expenses increasing by $471 million for the year. Compensation and benefits expense increased by $7.324 billion for the year, and was impacted by several items including the charge for the withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund, higher wage rates in the union workforce, increased stock-based compensation, higher expense for union pension and welfare programs, the SVSO charge, and the restructuring charge in our Supply Chain & Freight business in France. These increases were slightly offset by lower workers compensation expense. Our national master agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (“Teamsters”) allowed us, upon ratification, to withdraw employees from the Central States Pension Fund and to establish a jointly trusteed single-employer plan for this group. Upon ratification of the contract in December 2007 and our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund, we recorded a pre-tax $6.100 billion charge to establish our withdrawal liability, and made a December 2007 payment in the same amount to the Central States Pension Fund to satisfy this liability. In December 2006, we offered a special voluntary separation opportunity (“SVSO”) to approximately 640 employees who work in non-operating functions. This program was established to improve the efficiency of non-operating processes by eliminating duplication and sharing expertise across the company. The SVSO ended in February 2007, and 195, or 30% of eligible employees, accepted the offer. As a result, we recorded a charge to expense of approximately $68 million in the first quarter of 2007, to reflect the cash payout and the acceleration of stock compensation and certain retiree healthcare benefits under the SVSO program. In the third quarter of 2007, we initiated a restructuring plan for our forwarding and logistics operations in France. The objective of this restructuring plan was to reduce our forwarding and logistics cost structure and focus on profitable revenue growth in the Europe region. The restructuring principally consisted of an employment reduction program, which was ratified by our company’s trade union representatives in France in July 2007. Employees participating in this program are entitled to severance benefits, including certain bonuses for employees participating in the voluntary termination phase. These severance benefits are formula-driven and are in accordance with French statutory laws as well as the applicable collective bargaining agreements. We recorded a restructuring charge of $46 million ($42 million related to severance costs, and thus recorded in compensation and benefits expense) in 2007 related to this program. Stock-based and other management incentive compensation expense increased $113 million, or 17.7%, during 2007, primarily due to 2007 awards of stock options, restricted performance units, and restricted stock units. Pension and healthcare expense increased during the year, largely due to higher expense associated with plans covering union employees, but was somewhat offset by lower expense for the UPS-sponsored pension benefits (See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). During the first quarter of 2005, we modified our Management Incentive Awards program under our Incentive Compensation Plan to provide that half of the annual award be made in restricted stock units, with certain exceptions for first time participants in the program. The restricted stock units granted each year under this program generally have a five-year graded vesting period, with approximately 20% of the total restricted stock unit award vesting at each anniversary date of the grant. The other half of the Management Incentive Award granted each year is in the form of cash and unrestricted shares of Class A common stock and is fully vested at the time of grant. Previous awards under the Management Incentive Awards program were made in common stock that was fully vested in the year of grant. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, we recognize the expense associated with restricted stock unit awards over the appropriate vesting 28 period. We anticipate that this change in the award structure will have the effect of increasing the expense recognized for our restricted stock unit grants in future years, until approximately 2010, when we the effect of expensing new restricted stock unit grants will be somewhat offset with the elimination of expense from awards that have become completely vested. The expense associated with our self-insurance accruals for workers’ compensation claims, automotive liability and general business liabilities was $46 million lower in 2007 compared with 2006. Insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Recorded balances are based on reserve levels, which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. The lower expense reflects favorable claims experience resulting from several company initiatives put into place over the last several years and other factors, including initiatives to decrease accident frequencies, improved oversight and management of claims, improved trends in health care costs, and favorable state legislative reforms. The 0.2% increase in repairs and maintenance reflects higher maintenance expense on aircraft, largely offset by lower maintenance expense on vehicles and buildings. The 0.2% decrease in depreciation and amortization was influenced by several factors, including lower depreciation expense on aircraft and amortization expense on capitalized software, partially offset by increased depreciation expense on vehicles. The 7.4% increase in purchased transportation was impacted by volume growth in our International Package business and currency fluctuations, as well as growth in our international forwarding business. The 12.0% increase in fuel expense for the year was primarily due to higher prices for jet and diesel fuel, as well as higher usage, but was partially mitigated by hedging gains. Other occupancy expense increased 2.1% for the year, and was affected by increased rent expense and property taxes, but partially offset by lower utilities expense. The 3.0% increase in other expenses for the year was affected by a $221 million aircraft impairment charge, discussed further below, but partially offset with cost controls in several areas. The comparison in other expenses was also affected by the $87 million charge in the Cornn class action litigation in 2006 (see “Contingencies” section). As a result of business changes that occurred in the first quarter of 2007, including capacity-optimization programs in our domestic and international air freight forwarding business as well as changes to our aircraft orders and planned delivery dates, we began a review process of our aircraft fleet types to ensure that we maintain the optimum mix of aircraft types to service our international and domestic package businesses. The review was completed in March 2007, and based on the results of our evaluation we accelerated the planned retirement of certain Boeing 727 and 747 aircraft, and recognized an impairment and obsolescence charge of $221 million for the aircraft and related engines and parts in 2007. This charge is included in the caption “Other expenses” in the Statement of Consolidated Income, of which $159 million impacted our U.S. Domestic Package segment and $62 million impacted our International Package segment. 2006 compared to 2005 Consolidated operating expenses increased by $4.474 billion, or 12.3%, for the year, and were significantly impacted by the acquisitions of Overnite, Stolica, and Lynx. Currency fluctuations in our International Package and Supply Chain & Freight segments resulted in operating expenses increasing by $84 million for the year. Compensation and benefits increased by $1.904 billion, or 8.5%, for the year, largely due to the acquisitions mentioned above, as well as increased health and welfare benefit costs and higher pension expense. These increases were partially offset by the decline in workers compensation expense, as previously discussed. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, compensation and benefits expense increased 5.1% for the year. Stock-based and other management incentive compensation expense increased $49 million, or 8.0% in 2006, due to the expensing of restricted stock units granted in the fourth quarter of 2005, the impact of a new grant of stock options and restricted performance units in the second quarter of 2006, and the impact of adopting the non-substantive vesting period approach of FAS 123R (discussed further in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). These grants were partially offset by lower accruals for our Management Incentive Awards program in 2006. 29 Other operating expenses increased by $2.570 billion, or 18.5%, for the year, largely due to the acquisitions mentioned above, as well as increases in fuel expense and purchased transportation. The table below indicates the impact of business acquisitions completed in 2005 on the increase in operating expenses by category in 2006. Total %Increase AcquisitionImpact % IncreasewithoutAcquisitions Other Operating Expenses: Repairs and maintenance 5.3 % 3.0 % 2.3 % Depreciation and amortization 6.3 % 3.1 % 3.2 % Purchased transportation 34.9 % 4.8 % 30.1 % Fuel 27.3 % 7.1 % 20.2 % Other occupancy 7.6 % 4.2 % 3.4 % Other expenses 8.5 % 3.9 % 4.6 % 18.5 % 4.5 % 14.0 % Excluding the effect of acquisitions, the 20.2% increase in fuel expense for the year was impacted by higher prices for jet-A, diesel and unleaded gasoline as well as higher usage, but was partially mitigated by hedging gains. The 30.1% increase in purchased transportation was influenced by volume growth in our International Package business, currency fluctuations, higher fuel prices, increased rail costs, and changes to the freight forwarding business model described previously. The 2.3% increase in repairs and maintenance was largely due to increased expense on airframe and engine repairs. The 3.2% increase in depreciation and amortization for the year was caused primarily by higher depreciation expense on plant equipment, aircraft and engines, and higher amortization expense on intangible assets. The 3.4% increase in other occupancy expense was largely due to higher electricity and other utilities expenses. The increase in other expenses was impacted by several items, including the $87 million tentative settlement of a class action litigation (see “Contingencies” section below). Investment Income and Interest Expense 2007 compared to 2006 The increase in investment income of $13 million was primarily due to higher realized gains on sales of investments, but partially offset by a lower average balance of interest-earning investments and increased equity-method losses on investment partnerships. Interest expense increased $35 million in 2007, primarily due to higher average debt balances outstanding, largely related to commercial paper. Our commercial paper balances increased in the fourth quarter of 2007, causing a corresponding increase in interest expense, as a result of the payment made to withdraw from the Central States Pension Fund. Increased interest charges were somewhat offset, however, by higher capitalized interest related to various construction projects, including aircraft purchases and our Worldport expansion. 2006 compared to 2005 The decrease in investment income of $18 million during the year was primarily due to a lower average balance of interest-earning investments, due to the timing of cash payments for pension fundings, business acquisitions, and capital expenditures. This was partially offset by a higher average interest rate earned on investments, as well as the absence of any investment impairments during 2006 ($16 million of investment impairments were recognized in 2005, as described below). The $39 million increase in interest expense during the year was primarily due to higher average interest rates on variable rate debt and interest rate swaps, as well as interest expense incurred on debt related to real estate investment partnerships. This was partially offset by slightly lower average debt balances during 2006, as well as higher capitalized interest due to large aircraft contract deposit payments made during the year. 30 Net Income and Earnings Per Share 2007 compared to 2006 Net income for 2007 was $382 million, an 90.9% decrease from the $4.202 billion achieved in 2006, resulting in an 90.7% decrease in diluted earnings per share to $0.36 in 2007 from $3.86 in 2006. This decrease in net income was largely due to the after-tax $3.772 billion charge recorded to reflect our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund. Additionally, 2007 net income was adversely impacted by $31 million as a result of the restructuring charge in our France Supply Chain & Freight business, $141 million as a result of the aircraft impairment charge, and $43 million as a result of the SVSO charge. These items were partially offset by the improved results in our International Package and Supply Chain & Freight segments. The reduction in basic and diluted earnings per share were largely due to the pension withdrawal, aircraft impairment, France restructuring, and SVSO charges noted above. These items reduced basic and diluted earnings per share by $3.77 and $3.75 in 2007. Basic and diluted earnings per share benefited from a reduction in outstanding shares in 2007 compared with 2006, due to our ongoing share repurchase program. 2006 compared to 2005 Net income for 2006 was $4.202 billion, an 8.6% increase from the $3.870 billion achieved in 2005, resulting in a 11.2% increase in diluted earnings per share to $3.86 in 2006 from $3.47 in 2005. Net income in 2006 benefited from a $52 million reduction in income tax expense ($0.05 impact to diluted earnings per share) due to favorable developments with certain U.S. Federal tax contingency matters involving non-U.S. operations. Diluted earnings per share has increased at a faster rate than the growth in net income due to the reduction in shares outstanding as a result of our ongoing share repurchase program. The increase in net income for 2006 was largely due to higher operating profits for both our U.S. Domestic and International Package segments. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.123, $5.589, and $5.793 billion in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The decrease in 2007 operating cash flows compared with 2006 and 2005 was primarily due to the $6.100 billion payment made to withdraw from the Central States Pension Fund in 2007. This was partially offset by reduced 2007 fundings to our management pension and postretirement benefit plans. In 2007, we funded $687 million to our pension and postretirement benefit plans as compared to $1.625 billion in 2006 and $995 million in 2005. As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, pension and postretirement health contributions to plan trusts in 2008 are projected to be approximately $133 million. The amount of U.S. federal estimated income tax payments was lower in 2007 compared with 2006 and 2005, due to the deductibility of the pension withdrawal payment for income tax purposes. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2008, we received an $850 million U.S. federal tax refund due to 2007 overpayments of our estimated tax liability. In 2005, we received a $374 million tax refund associated with the 1985-1990 settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) reached previously, primarily on tax matters related to excess value package insurance. Additionally, we paid approximately $35 million in 2007 to employees who accepted the SVSO offer, and we expect to pay approximately $28 million in the first quarter of 2008 related to this program. On November 9, 2007, we announced a rate increase and a change in the fuel surcharge that took effect on December 31, 2007. We increased the base rates 6.9% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, and UPS 3 Day Select, and 4.9% on UPS Ground. We also increased the base rates 6.9% for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service). Other pricing changes included a $0.10 increase in the residential surcharge, and 31 an increase of $0.10 in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain ZIP codes. These rate changes are customary, and are consistent with previous years’ rate increases. Additionally, we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic and U.S.-origin international air services by reducing by 2% the index used to determine the fuel surcharge. The UPS Ground fuel surcharge continues to fluctuate based on the U.S. Energy Department’s On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. were made throughout the past year and varied by geographic market. In January 2008, UPS Freight announced a general rate increase averaging 5.4 percent covering non-contractual shipments in the United States and Canada. The increase goes into effect on February 4, 2008, and applies to minimum charge, LTL and TL rates. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $2.199 billion, $2.340 billion, and $975 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The decrease in cash used in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to lower capital expenditures and increased net sales of marketable securities and short-term investments. Net sales of marketable securities and short-term investments were $621 million, $482 million, and $2.752 billion in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, and were primarily used to fund our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans, as well as complete business acquisitions. In 2005, we spent $1.488 billion on business acquisitions, primarily Overnite Corp., Lynx Express Ltd. in the United Kingdom, Messenger Service Stolica S.A. in Poland, and the express operations of Sinotrans Air Transportation Development Co. Ltd. in China (See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). We had a net cash use of $39 million in 2007, compared with cash generation of $68 and $95 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, due to originations, sales, and customer paydowns of finance receivables, primarily in our commercial lending, asset-based lending, and leasing portfolios. In the second quarter of 2006, we terminated several energy derivatives and received $229 million in cash, which is reported in other investing activities in the statement of cash flows. These derivatives were designated as hedges of forecasted cash outflows for purchases of fuel products. As these derivatives maintained their effectiveness and qualified for hedge accounting, we recognized the gains associated with these hedges as a reduction of fuel expense over the original term of the hedges through 2007. Capital expenditures represent a primary use of cash in investing activities, as follows (in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Buildings and facilities $ 853 $ 720 $ 495 Aircraft and parts 1,137 1,150 874 Vehicles 492 831 456 Information technology 338 384 362 $ 2,820 $ 3,085 $ 2,187 As described in the “Commitments” section below, we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft, vehicles, equipment and other fixed assets to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth. We fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations. Financing Activities Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $2.297, ($3.851), and ($4.175) billion in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, we increased our commercial paper borrowings to $7.366 billion, an increase of $6.575 billion over December 31, 2006. This issuance of commercial paper was used to fund the withdrawal payment to the Central States Pension Fund upon ratification of our labor contract with the Teamsters, as previously discussed. The commercial paper balance was reduced subsequent to December 31, 2007 as a result of an issuance of long-term debt (discussed further in the “Sources of Credit” section) and the receipt of an income tax refund. 32 Issuances of debt during 2007 consisted primarily of issuances of commercial paper and UPS Notes. Repayments of debt consisted primarily of scheduled principal payments on our capital lease obligations and principal payments on debt related to our investment in certain equity-method partnerships. We consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non-scheduled repayments of debt. Our primary uses of cash in financing activities have been to repurchase stock, pay dividends, and repay long-term debt. In October 2007, the Board of Directors approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization to $2.0 billion, which replaced the remaining amount available under our February 2007 share repurchase authorization. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we repurchased a total of 35.9, 32.6, and 33.9 million shares of Class A and Class B common stock for $2.618 , $2.455, and $2.479 billion, respectively ($2.639, $2.460, and $2.479 billion reported on the statement of cash flows due to timing of settlements). In January 2008, we announced a new financial policy regarding our capital structure to enhance shareowner value. Prospectively, we intend to manage our balance sheet to a target debt ratio of approximately 50%-60% funds from operations to total debt. To implement this policy, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in our share repurchase authorization to $10.0 billion. We intend to complete this level of share repurchases within two years. Share repurchases may take the form of an accelerated share repurchase program, open market purchases, or other such methods as we deem appropriate. We increased our quarterly cash dividend payment to $0.42 per share in 2007 from $0.38 per share in 2006, resulting in an increase in total cash dividends paid to $1.703 billion from $1.577 billion. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other relevant factors. We expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends. On January 31, 2008, our Board declared a dividend of $0.45 per share, which is payable on March 4, 2008 to shareowners of record on February 11, 2008. The Board also approved an earlier payment schedule for the dividend typically declared in November. Beginning in 2008 and going forward, that dividend is expected to be paid in December instead of the following January. The movement of the fourth quarter dividend payment into December will result in a total of five dividend payments being made in 2008. Sources of Credit We are authorized to borrow up to $10.0 billion under our U.S. commercial paper program. We had $7.366 billion outstanding under this program as of December 31, 2007, with an average interest rate of 4.36%. At December 31, 2007, we classified $4.0 billion of our commercial paper as long-term debt on our balance sheet, due to the subsequent refunding of the commercial paper through the issuance of long-term debt, as discussed further below. We also maintain a European commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to €1.0 billion in a variety of currencies, however no amounts were outstanding under this program as of December 31, 2007. In November 2007, we filed a shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the United States. On January 15, 2008, we completed an offering of $1.750 billion of 4.50% senior notes due January 2013, $750 million of 5.50% senior notes due January 2018, and $1.500 billion of 6.20% senior notes due January 2038. All of these notes pay interest semiannually, and allow for redemption of the notes by UPS at any time by paying the greater of the principal amount or a “make-whole” amount, plus accrued interest. After pricing and underwriting discounts, we received a total of $3.961 billion in cash proceeds from the offering. The proceeds from the offering were used to reduce our outstanding commercial paper balance. We maintain three credit agreements with a consortium of banks, two of which provide revolving credit facilities of $1.0 billion each, with one expiring April 17, 2008 and the other April 19, 2012, and the third 33 providing a revolving credit facility of $7.0 billion and expiring on October 17, 2008. Interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90-day LIBOR plus 15 basis points. At December 31, 2007, there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities. Our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants. Covenants in our credit facilities generally require us to maintain a $3.0 billion minimum net worth and limit the amount of secured indebtedness that may be incurred by the company. The notes issued in January 2008 include limitations on secured indebtedness and on sale-leaseback transactions. These covenants are not considered material to the overall financial condition of the company, and all applicable covenant tests were satisfied as of December 31, 2007. Commitments We have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases, operating leases, debt obligations, purchase commitments, and certain other liabilities. We intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations. The following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2007 (in millions): Year CapitalLeases OperatingLeases DebtPrincipal DebtInterest PurchaseCommitments PensionFundings OtherLiabilities 2008 $ 108 $ 378 $ 3,426 $ 329 $ 1,306 $ 101 $ 78 2009 73 325 83 384 791 824 74 2010 91 237 40 380 729 630 71 2011 31 166 33 379 698 717 69 2012 31 116 26 377 304 859 67 After 2012 285 560 6,919 6,177 — 334 203 Total $ 619 $ 1,782 $ 10,527 $ 8,026 $ 3,828 $ 3,465 $ 562 Our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft. Capital leases, operating leases, and purchase commitments, as well as our debt principal obligations, are discussed further in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. The amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixed-rate debt, in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of December 31, 2007. The calculations of debt interest do not take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements. The maturities of debt principal and interest include the effect of the January 2008 issuance of $4.0 billion in senior notes that were used to reduce the commercial paper balance. Purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding, the largest of which are orders for aircraft, engines, and parts. In February 2007, we announced an order for 27 Boeing 767-300ER freighters to be delivered between 2009 and 2012. We also have firm commitments to purchase nine Boeing 747-400F aircraft scheduled for delivery between 2008 and 2010, and two Boeing 747-400BCF aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2008. These aircraft purchase orders will provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth. In July 2007, we formally cancelled our previous order for ten Airbus A380-800 freighter aircraft, pursuant to the provisions of an agreement signed with Airbus in February 2007. As a result of our cancellation of the Airbus A380-800 order, we received cash in July 2007 representing the return of amounts previously paid to Airbus as purchase contract deposits and accrued interest on those balances. Additionally, we received a credit memorandum to be used by UPS for the purchase of parts and services from Airbus. The cancellation of the Airbus order did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. 34 Pension fundings represent the anticipated required cash contributions that will be made to the UPS IBT Pension Plan, which was established upon ratification of the national master agreement with the Teamsters. The UPS IBT Pension Plan is the only UPS-sponsored pension or postretirement benefit plan with a material minimum funding requirement as of December 31, 2007. The pension funding requirements were estimated under the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, using discount rates, asset returns, and other assumptions appropriate for this plan. To the extent that the funded status of the UPS IBT pension plan in future years differs from our current projections, the actual contributions made in future years could materially differ from the amounts shown in the table above. The contractual payments due under the “other liabilities” column primarily includes commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships. The table above does not include approximately $355 million of unrecognized tax benefits that have been recognized as liabilities in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”), because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash. In addition, although we have recognized and disclosed unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with FIN 48, we also have outstanding recognized tax benefits in excess of the recorded liabilities such that we do not believe a net contractual obligation exists to the taxing authorities. FIN 48 is discussed further in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2007, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $2.177 billion issued in connection with routine business requirements. As of December 31, 2007, we had unfunded loan commitments totaling $860 million associated with our financial business. We believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long-term needs for the operation of our business, including anticipated capital expenditures, such as commitments for aircraft purchases, for the foreseeable future. Contingencies We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various class-action allegations under state wage-and-hour laws. In one of these cases, Marlo v. UPS, which has been certified as a class action in a California federal court, plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime, and seek penalties for missed meal and rest periods, and interest and attorneys’ fees. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of 1,200 full-time supervisors. In August 2005, the court granted summary judgment in favor of UPS on all claims, and plaintiff appealed the ruling. In October 2007, the appeals court reversed the lower court’s ruling. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. In another case, Cornn v. UPS, which was certified as a class action in a California federal court, plaintiffs allege that they were improperly denied wages and/or overtime and meal and rest periods. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of approximately 23,600 drivers and seek back wages, penalties, interest and attorneys’ fees. UPS settled this matter in full for a total payment of $87 million in the second quarter of 2007. The settlement had no impact on our 2007 operating results as it was accrued for previously during the third quarter of 2006. In another case, Hohider v. UPS, which in July 2007 was certified as a class action in a Pennsylvania federal court, plaintiffs have challenged certain aspects of the Company’s interactive process for assessing requests for reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of over 35,000 current and former employees, and seek backpay, compensatory and punitive damages, as well as attorneys’ fees. In August 2007, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Company’s Petition to hear the appeal of the trial court’s recent certification order. The appeal will likely take one year. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. 35 UPS and Mail Boxes Etc., Inc. are defendants in various lawsuits brought by franchisees who operate Mail Boxes Etc. centers and The UPS Store locations. These lawsuits relate to the re-branding of Mail Boxes Etc. centers to The UPS Store, the The UPS Store business model, the representations made in connection with the rebranding and the sale of The UPS Store franchises, and UPS’s sale of services in the franchisees’ territories. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. UPS and UPS Freight, along with several other companies involved in the LTL freight business, have been named as defendants in numerous putative class-action lawsuits filed since July 30, 2007 in courts across the nation. The cases have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in a Multi-District Litigation proceeding in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The lawsuits allege that the defendants conspired to fix fuel surcharge rates, and they seek injunctive relief, treble damages and attorneys’ fees. We intend to defend against these suits vigorously. These cases are at a preliminary stage and at this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. We are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business. We believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Along with an income tax audit for years 2003 and 2004, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is currently examining non-income based taxes including excise taxes on transportation of property by air and fuel purchases, which could lead to proposed assessments. The IRS has not presented an official position with regard to excise taxes at this time, and therefore we are not able to determine the technical merit of any potential assessment; however, we do not believe that the resolution of this matter would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 246,000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the Teamsters. In September 2007, we reached a new national master agreement with the Teamsters, which was ratified in December 2007. The new agreement provides for wage increases as well as contributions to healthcare and pension plans, and most economic provisions of the new five year agreement will take effect on August 1, 2008, with the exception of our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund, as discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. We have approximately 2,900 pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association, which becomes amendable at the end of 2011. Our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727, which became amendable on November 1, 2006. We began formal negotiations with Teamsters Local 2727 on October 2, 2006. In addition, the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (approximately 2,900). These agreements run through July 31, 2009. Apart from the Central States Pension Fund, we participate in a number of trustee-managed multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. Several factors could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in demographics, and increased benefits to participants. At this time, we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions, if any, or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity would result from our participation in these plans. Other Matters We received grand jury subpoenas from the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) regarding the DOJ’s investigations into air cargo pricing practices in July 2006 and into freight forwarding 36 pricing practices in December 2007. In October 2007, we received information requests from the European Commission and the New Zealand Commerce Commission relating to investigations of freight forwarding pricing practices. We are cooperating with these investigations. Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. All of these market risks arise in the normal course of business, as we do not engage in speculative trading activities. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we utilize a variety of foreign exchange, interest rate, equity and commodity forward contracts, options, and swaps. The following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk. We utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates, interest rate yield curves, and commodity and equity prices. For options and instruments with non-linear returns, models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts. There are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. A discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels, principally jet-A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline. Currently, the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and LTL services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes. Additionally, we use a combination of options contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy prices. The net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 was an asset (liability) of $(179) and $10 million, respectively. The potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $42 and $8 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities. In the second quarter of 2006, we terminated several energy derivatives and received $229 million in cash. These derivatives were designated as hedges of forecasted cash outflows for purchases of fuel products. As these derivatives maintained their effectiveness and qualified for hedge accounting, the gains associated with these hedges were recognized in income over the original term of the hedges through the end of 2007. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, operating expenses, and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate. We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and the Canadian Dollar. We use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods up to one year. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset (liability) of $(42) and $30 million, respectively. The potential loss in fair value for 37 such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $387 and $183 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates. Exchange rates rarely move in the same direction. The assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. Interest Rate Risk As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, we have issued debt instruments, including debt associated with capital leases, that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest. We use a combination of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. These swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify, and the notional amount, interest payment, and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt. Our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short-term (primarily LIBOR) interest rates. The potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in short-term interest rates applied to our floating rate debt and swap instruments at December 31, 2007 and 2007 would be approximately $100 and $29 million, respectively. We have investments in debt and preferred equity securities (including auction rate securities), as well as cash-equivalent instruments, some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest. The potential change in annual investment income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our investments exposed to variable interest rates at December 31, 2007 and 2006 would be approximately $15 and $12 million, respectively. Additionally, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest. The potential change in the annual income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our variable rate finance receivables at December 31, 2007 and 2006 would be immaterial. This interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios, these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts. We adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions. Equity Price Risk We hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk, and for certain of these securities, we utilize options to hedge this price risk. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the fair value of such investments was $35 and $80 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of such investments, assuming a 10% change in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges, would be approximately $4 and $8 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Credit Risk The forward contracts, swaps, and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. However, we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines. We do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default. 38 New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS 157”), which was issued to define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value, and expand disclosures about fair value measurements, and is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB deferred the effective date of FAS 157 for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities, and removed certain leasing transactions from its scope. We adopted FAS 157 on January 1, 2008, and the impact of adoption was not material to our results of operations or financial condition. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 158 “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R))” (“FAS 158”). This statement requires us to recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the balance sheet, and required delayed recognition items, consisting of actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits, to be recognized in other comprehensive income and subsequently amortized to the income statement. On December 31, 2006, we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of FAS 158, which resulted in a reduction to AOCI of $2.097 billion and a reduction of long-term deferred tax liabilities of $1.258 billion. Additionally, we currently utilize the early measurement date option available under Statement No. 87 “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions”, and we measure the funded status of our plans as of September 30 each year. Under the provisions of FAS 158, we will be required to use a December 31 measurement date for all of our pension and postretirement benefit plans beginning in 2008. As a result of this change in measurement date, we recorded a cumulative effect after-tax $44 million reduction to retained earnings as of January 1, 2008. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159 “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“FAS 159”), which gives entities the option to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value (i.e., the fair value option), on an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are otherwise not accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards. The election to use the fair value option is available at specified election dates, such as when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or financial liability or upon entering into a firm commitment. Subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings. Additionally, SFAS No. 159 allows for a one-time election for existing positions upon adoption, with the transition adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings. We adopted FAS 159 on January 1, 2008, and elected to apply the fair value option to our investment in certain investment partnerships that were previously accounted for under the equity method. Accordingly, we recorded an after-tax $12 million reduction to retained earnings as of January 1, 2008, representing the cumulative effect adjustment of adopting FAS 159. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 requires that we determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets this recognition threshold, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. On January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FIN 48, and the impact of this Interpretation is discussed in Note 13. In June 2007, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 06-11, “Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards.” EITF 06-11 requires that the tax benefit related to dividend equivalents paid on restricted stock units, which are expected to vest, be recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital. EITF 06-11 is to be applied prospectively for tax benefits on dividends declared in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007, and we will adopt the provisions of EITF 06-11 beginning in the first quarter of 2008. EITF 06-11 is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. In December 2007 the FASB issued Statement No. 141(R) “Business Combinations” (“FAS 141(R)”). FAS 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired 39 and liabilities assumed in the transaction (whether a full or partial acquisition); establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; requires expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs; and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. FAS 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. The impact of FAS No. 141R on our consolidated financial statements will depend upon the nature, terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date. In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51” (“FAS 160”). FAS 160 requires reporting entities to present noncontrolling (minority) interests as equity (as opposed to as a liability or mezzanine equity) and provides guidance on the accounting for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $13 million in noncontrolling interests classified in other non-current liabilities. FAS 160 applies prospectively as of January 1, 2009, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As indicated in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles. We base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates, which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements. While estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts, we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Contingencies—As discussed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies. We have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies” (“FAS 5”). FAS 5 requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency. The actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates. If a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate, a future charge to income would result. Likewise, if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate, a future credit to income would result. The events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable. At the time a contingency is identified, we consider all relevant facts as part of our FAS 5 evaluation. We record a liability for a loss that meets the recognition criteria of FAS 5. These criteria require recognition of a liability when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable. Events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability. These factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. Contingent losses that meet the recognition criteria under FAS 5, excluding those related to income taxes and self insurance which are discussed further below, were not material to the Company’s financial position as of December 31, 2007. In addition, we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of December 31, 2007, because a loss is not reasonably estimable. Goodwill Impairment—We account for goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“FAS 142”), which requires annual impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units. Goodwill impairment testing requires that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet. 40 We use a discounted cash flow model (“DCF model”) to estimate the fair value of our goodwill. The completion of the DCF model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows. These assumptions include projections of future revenue, costs and working capital changes. In addition, we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables, as required, in estimating the fair value of our reporting units. The projections that we use in our DCF model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units. As of December 31, 2007, our recorded goodwill was $2.577 billion, of which $2.282 billion relates to our Supply Chain and Freight segment. This segment of our business has experienced rapid growth over the last several years, largely due to the acquisitions that we have made. Because of its growth, this segment continues to experience significant change as we integrate the acquired companies, resulting in higher volatility in our DCF model projections than for our other segments. Our annual impairment tests performed in 2007, 2006 and 2005 resulted in no goodwill impairment. Self-Insurance Accruals—We self-insure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims, automotive liability, health and welfare, and general business liabilities, up to certain limits. Insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Recorded balances are based on reserve levels, which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. Trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves. We believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate, but actual experience in claim frequency and/or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations. Workers’ compensation, automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle. Consequently, actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open, trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. Changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our self-insurance accruals. All of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. We sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees. These liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans, anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation. Actual results may differ from these estimates and, therefore, produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. Pension and Postretirement Medical Benefits—As discussed in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, we maintain several defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans. Our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions.” These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, rate of compensation increases, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends. Differences in actual 41 experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. A 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate, expected return on assets, and health care cost trend rate for the U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans would result in the following increases (decreases) on the Company’s costs and obligations for the year 2007 (in millions): 25 Basis PointIncrease 25 Basis PointDecrease Pension Plans Discount Rate: Effect on net periodic benefit cost $ (65 ) $ 67 Effect on projected benefit obligation (615 ) 643 Return on Assets: Effect on net periodic benefit cost (36 ) 36 Postretirement Medical Plans Discount Rate: Effect on net periodic benefit cost (6 ) 6 Effect on projected benefit obligation (88 ) 91 Health Care Cost Trend Rate: Effect on net periodic benefit cost 2 (2 ) Effect on projected benefit obligation 19 (19 ) Financial Instruments—As discussed in Notes 2, 3, 8, and 15 to our consolidated financial statements, and in the “Market Risk” section of this report, we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk. Certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Fair values are based on listed market prices, when such prices are available. To the extent that listed market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations. Certain financial instruments, including over-the-counter derivative instruments, are valued using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual and market prices, correlations, time value, credit spreads, and yield curve volatility factors. Changes in the fixed income, equity, foreign exchange, and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our results of operations. A quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices is presented in the “Market Risk” section of this report. Depreciation, Residual Value, and Impairment of Fixed Assets—As of December 31, 2007, we had $17.663 billion of net fixed assets, the most significant category of which is aircraft. In accounting for fixed assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets. In estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft, we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types. Subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program, changes in the utilization of the aircraft, governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary. Adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“FAS 144”), we review long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows, or external appraisals, as applicable. We review long-lived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified. The circumstances that 42 would indicate potential impairment may include, but are not limited to, a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. In estimating cash flows, we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business. Adverse changes in these volume forecasts, or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections, could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand. This situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type, resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type (thus resulting in increased depreciation expense). As a result of business changes that occurred in the first quarter of 2007, including capacity-optimization programs in our domestic and international air freight forwarding business as well as changes to our aircraft orders and planned delivery dates, we began a review process of our aircraft fleet types to ensure that we maintain the optimum mix of aircraft types to service our international and domestic package businesses. The review was completed in March 2007, and based on the results of our evaluation, we accelerated the planned retirement of certain Boeing 727 and 747 aircraft, and recognized an impairment and obsolescence charge of $221 million for the aircraft and related engines and parts in 2007. This charge is included in the caption “Other expenses” in the Statement of Consolidated Income, of which $159 million impacted our U.S. Domestic Package segment and $62 million impacted our International Package segment. During 2006, we reevaluated the anticipated service lives of our Boeing 757, Boeing 767, and Airbus A300 fleets, and as a result of this evaluation, increased the depreciable lives from 20 to 30 years and reduced the residual values from 30% to 10% of original cost. This change did not have a material effect on our results of operations. Income Taxes—We make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction, tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. We assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In the first quarter of 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of SFAS No. 109” (“FIN 48”), and related guidance (see Note 13 in the consolidated financial statements). As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process prescribed in the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. 43 Forward-Looking Statements “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and other parts of this report contain “forward-looking” statements about matters that inherently are difficult to predict. The words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “we see,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements include statements regarding our intent, belief and current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects and future results. We have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Risk Factors The following are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forward-looking statements: • The effect of general economic and other conditions in the markets in which we operate, both in the United States and internationally. Our operations in international markets are also affected by currency exchange and inflation risks. • The impact of competition on a local, regional, national, and international basis. Our competitors include the postal services of the U.S. and other nations, various motor carriers, express companies, freight forwarders, air couriers and others. Our industry is undergoing rapid consolidation, and the combining entities are competing aggressively for business. • The impact of complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, labor, employment and other governmental laws and regulations, and the impact of new laws and regulations that may result from increased security concerns following the events of September 11, 2001. Our failure to comply with applicable laws, ordinances or regulations could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations. • Strikes, work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees. Such actions may affect our ability to meet our customers needs, and customers may do more business with competitors if they believe that such actions may adversely affect our ability to provide service. We may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service. The terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations. • Possible disruption of supplies, or an increase in the prices, of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles as a result of war or other factors. We require significant quantities of fuel and are exposed to the commodity price risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products. • Cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results due to decreased demand for our services. 44 Item 7A.

Next Day Air volume, deferred air volume and ground volume declined 7.1%, 2.8%, and 1.4%, respectively for the year, primarily as a result of the current U.S. recession. These declining volume trends worsened through the year with Next Day Air, deferred air, and ground volume declining 8.6%, 3.5%, and 2.1%, respectively, during the fourth quarter. Relatively high energy costs during most of the year combined with the deepening recession and weak output within the industrial production and retail sales sectors adversely affected the small package market, which places additional pressure on our domestic package volume. The increase in overall revenue per piece of 3.0% resulted primarily from a rate increase that took effect during the first quarter and higher fuel surcharge rates, but was partially offset by an unfavorable shift in product mix. Next Day Air and Deferred revenue per piece increased 4.8% and 1.8%, respectively, and were positively impacted by the base rate increase and a higher fuel surcharge rate for air products (discussed further below). This increase was adversely impacted by lower average package weights, a mix shift toward lower yielding products, and hedging losses. Ground revenue per piece increased 3.9%, mainly due to the rate increase, as well as a higher fuel surcharge rate due to increased diesel fuel prices in 2008 compared with 2007. On November 9, 2007, we announced a rate increase and a change in the fuel surcharge that took effect on December 31, 2007. We increased the base rates 6.9% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, and UPS 3 Day Select, and 4.9% on UPS Ground. Other pricing changes included a $0.10 increase in the residential surcharge, and an increase of $0.10 in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain ZIP codes. We also modified the fuel surcharge on domestic air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%. This fuel surcharge continues to be based on the U.S. Energy Department’s Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was 25.17% in 2008, an increase from the 12.17% in 2007, due to the significant increase in jet fuel prices in early and mid-2008, but partially offset by the 2% reduction in the index. The ground fuel surcharge rate continues to fluctuate based on the U.S. Energy Department’s On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products increased to 7.97% in 2008 from 4.30% in 2007, due to significantly higher diesel fuel prices in early and mid-2008. Total domestic fuel surcharge revenue, net of the impact of hedging losses, increased by $1.119 billion in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily due to the higher fuel surcharge rates discussed above, but partially offset by the decline in volume for our air and ground products. U.S. domestic package operating profit increased $5.438 billion in 2008 compared with 2007. Operating profit for 2007 was adversely affected by a charge to withdraw from the Central States, Southeast and Southwest 22 Table of Contents Areas Pension Fund (“Central States Pension Fund”), an aircraft impairment and a Special Voluntary Separation Opportunity (“SVSO”) charge (all discussed further in the “Operating Expenses” section), which reduced domestic operating profit by $6.100 billion, $159 million and $53 million, respectively. The absence of these charges in 2008 favorably affected the operating profit comparison between periods. Operating profit in 2008 was adversely impacted by the current U.S. recession, lower asset utilization due to the decline in volume, lower average package weights, and a shift in product mix away from our premium services, partially offset by the increase in the fuel surcharge relative to the cost of fuel. Because fuel costs decreased rapidly in the latter half of the year, operating profit benefited from the approximate two month time lag between the fuel price changes and when the monthly surcharge rates are applied to package shipments. Because of this time lag, fuel positively impacted the change in operating profit during 2008, which is opposite of the effect the company experienced in 2007, when fuel costs rose much faster than the fuel surcharge rate and operating profit was adversely impacted. 2007 compared to 2006 U.S. Domestic Package revenue increased $529 million, or 1.7%, in 2007, due to a 1.6% improvement in revenue per piece and a 0.4% increase in average daily package volume. Next Day Air volume increased 0.8% and Ground volume increased 0.6% for the year, largely as a result of a solid peak season in the fourth quarter, when our Next Day Air volume rose 2.2% and Ground volume increased 1.5%. Deferred air volume declined 1.9% in 2007. Our domestic air and ground products have been impacted by the slowing U.S. economy and weak small package market in 2007. Trends in U.S. industrial production and business-to-consumer shipments in 2007 were not favorable to the overall small package market, which places pressure on our domestic package volume. The increase in overall revenue per piece of 1.6% in 2007 resulted primarily from a rate increase that took effect earlier in the year, but was negatively impacted by lower fuel surcharge revenue and an unfavorable shift in product mix. Next Day Air revenue per piece declined 0.9%, and was negatively impacted by strong growth in our lower-yielding Next Day Air Saver products. Deferred revenue per piece increased only 0.4%. The change in revenue per piece for all our air products was negatively impacted by a lower fuel surcharge rate (discussed further below). Ground revenue per piece increased 2.9%, primarily due to the rate increase, but was also impacted slightly by a higher fuel surcharge due to higher diesel fuel prices in 2007 compared with 2006. Overall product mix reduced revenue per piece, as our premium air products suffered volume declines while our ground volume grew 0.6%. Consistent with the practice in previous years, a rate increase took effect on January 1, 2007. We increased the base rates 6.9% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, and UPS 3 Day Select, and 4.9% on UPS Ground. Other pricing changes included a $0.10 increase in the residential surcharge, and a $0.75 increase in the charge for undeliverable packages after three delivery attempts. In January 2007, we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%. This fuel surcharge continued to be based on the U.S. Energy Department’s Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic air products was 12.17% in 2007, a decline from the 14.02% in 2006, primarily due to the 2% reduction in the index. The ground fuel surcharge rate continued to fluctuate based on the U.S. Energy Department’s On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge on domestic ground products was 4.30% in 2007, an increase from 4.13% in 2006, due to higher diesel fuel prices. As a result of the air products index rate reduction and fuel market price movements, total domestic fuel surcharge revenue decreased by $110 million in 2007. U.S. Domestic Package incurred an operating loss of $1.531 billion in 2007, compared with a $4.923 billion operating profit in 2006, largely due to a $6.100 billion charge related to our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund. Additionally, Domestic Package operating results were negatively impacted by low revenue 23 Table of Contents growth, the aircraft impairment charge, the SVSO charge, and the impact of fuel. The aircraft impairment and SVSO charges reduced domestic operating profit by $159 million and $53 million, respectively. Fuel negatively impacted the change in operating profit during 2007, as fuel costs rose much faster than the fuel surcharge rate. These factors were partially offset by cost controls, including, among other categories, lower self-insurance expense. The expense associated with our self-insurance accruals for workers’ compensation claims, automotive liability and general business liabilities declined as a result of several factors. The Central States Pension Fund withdrawal, aircraft impairment, and SVSO charges, as well as the impact of lower self-insurance expense, are discussed further in the “Operating Expenses” section. International Package Operations 2008 compared to 2007 International Package revenue improved $1.012 billion, or 9.8%, for the year, driven by a 6.8% volume increase for our export products and a 6.1% increase in total revenue per piece. The growth in revenue per piece was primarily due to rate increases, the impact of currency exchange rates, and increased fuel surcharge rates. However, as the global economic recession deepened throughout the year, fourth quarter revenue trended downward compared to the prior year fourth quarter, declining $230 million, or 8.0%, including the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations discussed later. Export volume increased in each region throughout the world in 2008, however volume began to slow in the latter half of 2008 due to difficult worldwide economic conditions. Intra-regional volume continued to experience solid growth, especially in Europe. Asian export volume continued to benefit from our geographic service expansion, including the connection of several cities to our new air hub in Shanghai, China. Export volume growth was negatively impacted by declines in shipments to the U.S. from other regions in the world, due to the slowing U.S. economy. Export volume trends weakened in the latter half of the year, due to the severe global economic slowdown, with fourth quarter export volume increasing at a much slower rate than what has been experienced over the last several years. Non-U.S. domestic volume increased 1.6% for the year, and was impacted by volume growth in our domestic businesses in the Euro zone and Canada, but negatively affected by the weak economic conditions in the United Kingdom. Export revenue per piece increased 3.7% for the year, largely due to base rate increases, higher fuel surcharge rates, and favorable currency exchange rates, but was adversely impacted by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder products and a shift away from our premium services. Domestic revenue per piece increased 6.0% for the year, and was affected by rate increases, higher fuel surcharge rates, and favorable exchange rates. Total average revenue per piece increased 2.7% on a currency-adjusted basis, and the overall change in segment revenue was positively affected by $324 million during the year due to currency fluctuations, net of hedging activity. Total revenue per piece declined 8.2% in the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar (currency-adjusted revenue per piece declined 3.0%), but also impacted by an acceleration in the shift away from our premium services and lower package weights. Fourth quarter 2008 total segment revenue was negatively impacted by $144 million due to the currency fluctuations, net of hedging activity. On December 31, 2007, we increased the base rates 6.9% for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service). Rate changes for international shipments originating outside the United States vary by geographical market and occur throughout the year. Additionally, we modified the fuel surcharge on certain U.S.-related international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%. The fuel surcharge for products originating outside the United States continues to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions, depending upon where the shipment takes place. Total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by $586 million in 2008, due to higher fuel surcharge rates caused by increased fuel prices as well as an increase in international air volume. 24 Table of Contents International Package operating profit decreased $251 million, or 13.7%, in 2008, and the operating margin declined to 14.0% from 17.8% in 2007. The decline in operating profit and operating margin were affected by reduced asset utilization resulting from changes in economic conditions and trade flows, such as the reduced import volume into the United States. Operating profit and margin were also negatively affected by a shift in product mix away from our premium services, as well as expenses associated with integration activities in our delivery network. Global economic weakness resulted in a weakening operating profit trend, with fourth quarter operating profit declining 34.3%. Because fuel costs decreased rapidly in the latter half of the year, operating profit benefited from the approximate two month time lag between the fuel price changes and when the monthly surcharge rates are applied to package shipments. As a result of this time lag, fuel positively impacted the change in operating profit during 2008, which is opposite of the effect the company experienced in 2007, when fuel costs rose much faster than the fuel surcharge rate and operating profit was adversely impacted. The change in operating profit was also positively affected by $136 million during the year due to favorable currency exchange rates, net of hedging activity. Operating profit in 2008 was adversely impacted by a fourth quarter $27 million impairment charge incurred on certain intangible assets in our domestic package business in the United Kingdom (discussed further in the “Operating Expenses” section). Operating profit for 2007 was adversely affected by the aircraft impairment and SVSO charges ($62 million of the aircraft impairment charge and $7 million of the SVSO charge impacted the International Package segment), and the absence of these charges in 2008 favorably affected the operating profit comparison between periods. 2007 compared to 2006 International Package revenue improved $1.192 billion, or 13.1% in 2007, driven by a 10.4% volume increase for our export products and an 8.3% increase in total revenue per piece. The growth in revenue per piece was positively impacted by base rate increases and the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against several major foreign currencies in 2007, but was adversely affected by a lower fuel surcharge rate applied to our U.S. origin international air products. Export volume increased throughout the world. Asian export volume grew strongly in key markets during the year, especially China. Asian export volume continues to benefit from our geographic service expansion, as well as strong economic growth, which benefits our intra-Asian package business. To continue this expansion, we received authority in 2007 to operate six daily flights between the U.S. and Nagoya, Japan, and began constructing a package and freight air hub in Shanghai, China that will link Shanghai to our international air network, with direct service to Europe, Asia, and the Americas. European export volume also grew solidly, largely due to continued growth in the transborder business and improved economic and industrial output in the European Union. U.S. export volume increased at a slower pace. Non-U.S. domestic volume increased 2.2% for the year, and was impacted by growth in several major European countries and Canada. Export revenue per piece increased 3.9% for the year, largely due to rate increases and favorable exchange rates, but was adversely impacted by relatively higher growth in lower revenue per piece transborder products, and a reduction in certain fuel surcharge rates. Non-U.S. domestic revenue per piece increased 9.6% for the year, and was affected by rate increases and favorable exchange rates. Total average revenue per piece increased 2.7% on a currency-adjusted basis, and the overall change in segment revenue was positively affected by $464 million in 2007 due to currency fluctuations, net of hedging activity. In January 2007, we increased rates 6.9% for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service). Rate changes for international shipments originating outside the United States vary by geographical market and occur throughout the year. 25 Table of Contents Also in January 2007, we modified the fuel surcharge on certain U.S.-related international air services by reducing the index used to determine the fuel surcharge by 2%. The fuel surcharge for products originating outside the United States continues to be indexed to fuel prices in our different international regions. Total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by $12 million during the year due to increased volume, but was partially offset by the reduction in the fuel surcharge index. International Package operating profit increased $121 million, or 7.1%, for the year, primarily due to the volume and revenue per piece improvements described above. The change in operating profit was also positively affected by $153 million during the year due to favorable currency exchange rates, net of hedging activity. International Package operating profit was adversely affected in 2007 by charges related to the aircraft impairment ($62 million) and the SVSO ($7 million), both of which are discussed further in the “Operating Expenses” section. Operating profit was negatively impacted by fuel, as the increase in fuel surcharge revenue was more than offset by the increase in fuel expense. The adverse impact of the aircraft impairment, SVSO charge, and fuel were the primary causes of the 100 basis point decline in operating margin to 17.8%. Supply Chain & Freight Operations 2008 compared to 2007 Supply Chain & Freight revenue increased $489 million, or 5.8%, for the year. Forwarding and logistics revenue increased $382 million, or 6.5%, for the year, primarily due to growth in international air freight, North American air freight, distribution services and mail services. Revenue growth in this business was affected by fuel and security surcharges, expanded air freight service offerings, overall market growth and improved customer retention rates. Growth was negatively impacted by weakness in the ocean freight business. Revenue declined by $98 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with 2007, as difficult worldwide economic conditions, slowing world trade, and unfavorable currency exchange rate movements negatively impacted the forwarding and logistics business. The overall change in forwarding and logistics revenue was positively affected by $166 million during the year due to favorable currency exchange rates, but was negatively impacted by $58 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. UPS Freight increased revenue $83 million, or 3.9%, for the year, as a result of improved yields and higher fuel surcharge rates, but partially offset by a decline in average daily LTL shipments. Average LTL shipments per day decreased 4.6% during the year, reflecting the weak LTL market in the United States in 2008 as compared with 2007. However, LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 7.3% for the year, due to an increase in base rates in 2008 and an increase in fuel surcharge revenue as a result of higher diesel prices. The weak U.S. LTL market declined further in the fourth quarter of 2008, which led to a revenue decline of $41 million, or 7.8%, from the comparable quarter of 2007. Fourth quarter average LTL shipments per day decreased 8.2%, with LTL revenue per hundredweight declining 2.4%, partially due to declining fuel surcharge rates. In January 2008, UPS Freight announced a general rate increase averaging 5.4% covering non-contractual shipments in the United States and Canada. The increase became effective on February 4, 2008, and applies to minimum charge, LTL and TL rates. The other businesses within Supply Chain & Freight, which include our retail franchising business and our financial business, increased revenue by 5.9% during the year. This revenue growth was impacted by increased revenue from our contract to provide domestic air transportation services for the U.S. Postal Service. Operating profit for the Supply Chain & Freight segment decreased by $383 million for the year, primarily due to a $548 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter in the UPS Freight business unit, as discussed further in the “Operating Expenses” section. Operating profit improved in the forwarding and logistics business, primarily resulting from revenue management initiatives and a focus on asset utilization. The change in operating profit was also positively affected by $12 million in 2008 due to favorable currency exchange rates. 26 Table of Contents Operating profit for this segment was negatively impacted in 2007 by $8 million due to the SVSO charge and by $46 million as a result of a charge for restructuring and disposing of certain non-core business units in France, as discussed further in the “Operating Expenses” section. The absence of these charges in 2008 favorably affected the operating profit comparison between periods. 2007 compared to 2006 Supply Chain & Freight revenue increased $424 million, or 5.3%, in 2007. Forwarding and logistics revenue increased $230 million, or 4.0%, for the year, and was affected by favorable exchange rate movements and revenue management initiatives begun in 2006. Favorable exchange rate movements positively affected the growth in revenue by $178 million during the year. Revenue growth in this business was driven by improvements in international air freight and mail services, which were impacted by overall market growth and lower customer turnover rates. UPS Freight increased revenue $156 million, or 8.0%, for the year as a result of improved yields and a strong increase in average daily shipment volume. Average LTL shipments per day increased 8.3% during the year, driven by new customer wins and leveraging our existing small package customer base for new sales opportunities. LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 9.3% during the year, due to an increase in base rates in 2007 and a focus on higher-yielding customer segments. The increase in revenue per hundredweight and average daily shipments were somewhat offset by a 7.5% decrease for the year in the LTL weight per shipment. The other businesses within Supply Chain & Freight, which include our retail franchising business, our financial business, and our U.S. domestic cargo operations, increased revenue by 10.3% during the year. This revenue growth was primarily due to increased revenue from our contract to provide domestic air transportation services for the U.S. Postal Service. Operating profit for the Supply Chain & Freight segment was $278 million in 2007, compared with a profit of $2 million in 2006, resulting in a 330 basis point improvement in the operating margin. This improvement was largely due to improved results in the forwarding and logistics business as a result of cost controls, a focus on asset utilization, and revenue management initiatives. Cost improvements were realized as a result of the restructuring program that began in 2006, which included a reduction of non-operating staff of approximately 1,400 people. Additionally, margin improvements are being realized by focusing on capacity utilization in the air freight business, through better utilizing space available on our own aircraft. Finally, revenue management initiatives put into place last year are producing better returns through reducing less profitable accounts, and ensuring that new accounts meet specific criteria that allow us to better utilize our existing transportation assets. Operating profit in 2007 for this segment was reduced by $46 million as a result of a charge for restructuring and disposing of certain non-core business units in France, as well as by $8 million due to the SVSO charge. These charges are discussed further in the “Operating Expenses” section. Currency fluctuations positively affected the growth in operating profit by $18 million in 2007. Operating Expenses 2008 compared to 2007 Consolidated operating expenses decreased by $3.010 billion, or 6.1%, for the year, primarily due to a reduction in compensation and benefits expense. Currency fluctuations in our International Package and Supply Chain & Freight segments accounted for approximately $342 million of increased operating expenses from 2007 to 2008. Compensation and benefits expense decreased by $5.682 billion, or 17.9%, for the year, and was impacted by several items. The primary reason for the decrease was a reduction in pension expense for our multiemployer pension plans, largely relating to a $6.100 billion charge in 2007 to withdraw from the Central States Pension 27 Table of Contents Fund. Partially offsetting this was a $216 million increase in expense for UPS-sponsored pension plans in the U.S., which was impacted by expense recognition now being required for the new UPS IBT Pension Plan. Non-pension benefits expense increased largely due to higher employee health and welfare program costs, which is impacted by medical cost inflation. Employee payroll costs increased due to contractual wage increases for our union employees and normal merit increases for our non-union employees. Compensation and benefits expense also declined due to the absence in 2008 of the SVSO and France restructuring charges, which had increased compensation and benefits expense by $68 and $42 million in 2007, respectively. The 3.2% increase in repairs and maintenance was largely due to increased aircraft maintenance, somewhat offset by reduced vehicle maintenance expense. The 4.0% increase in depreciation and amortization was influenced by several factors, including higher depreciation expense on aircraft and vehicles resulting from new deliveries, but partially offset by reduced amortization expense on capitalized software resulting from a decrease in software development projects. The 11.0% increase in purchased transportation was driven by a combination of higher volume in our international package and forwarding businesses, the impact of currency exchange rates, and increased fuel surcharge rates charged to us by third-party carriers. The 39.0% increase in fuel expense was impacted by higher prices for jet-A fuel, diesel, and unleaded gasoline as well as lower hedging gains. The 7.2% increase in other occupancy expense was influenced by higher electricity and natural gas costs, as well as higher rent and property tax expense. During the fourth quarter of 2008, declining energy prices impacted costs such as purchased transportation, which decreased $132 million, or 7.6%, and fuel, which decreased $118 million, or 12.7%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2007. Other expenses increased 14.9% for the year primarily due to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. In addition, we also experienced increased expenses for leased transportation equipment, data processing, advertising, professional services, and bad debts. These factors were partially offset by the absence in 2008 of a $221 million aircraft impairment charge recorded in 2007. We test our goodwill for impairment annually, as of October 1st, on a reporting unit basis in accordance with FASB Statement No. 142 “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“FAS 142”). Our reporting units are comprised of the Europe, Asia, and Americas reporting units in the International Package reporting segment, and the Forwarding & Logistics, UPS Freight, MBE / UPS Store, and UPS Capital reporting units in the Supply Chain & Freight reporting segment. The impairment test involves a two-step process. First, a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying values, including goodwill, is performed. We primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model, and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies, as applicable. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and determined that our UPS Freight reporting unit, which was formed through the acquisition of Overnite Corporation in 2005, had a goodwill impairment of $548 million. This impairment charge resulted from several factors, including a lower cash flow forecast due to a longer estimated economic recovery time for the LTL sector, and significant deterioration in equity valuations for other similar LTL industry participants. At the time of acquisition of Overnite Corporation, LTL equity valuations were higher and the economy was significantly stronger. We invested in operational improvements and technology upgrades to enhance service and performance, as well as expand service offerings. However, this process took longer than initially anticipated, and thus financial results have been below our expectations. Additionally, the LTL sector in 2008 has been adversely impacted by the economic recession in the U.S., lower industrial production and retail sales, volatile fuel prices, and significant levels of price-based competition. By the fourth quarter of 2008, the combination of these internal and external factors reduced our near term expectations for this unit, leading to the goodwill impairment charge. None of the other reporting units incurred an impairment of goodwill in 2008, nor did we have any goodwill impairment charges in 2007 or 2006. 28 Table of Contents As a result of weak performance in our domestic package operations in the United Kingdom, we reviewed our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment within our U.K. domestic package entity. Based on recent performance and near-term projections, the value assigned to a customer list intangible asset acquired within the U.K. domestic package business was determined to be impaired. This was the result of both higher than anticipated customer turnover and reduced operating margins associated with an acquired business. Accordingly, an intangible asset impairment charge of $27 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2008. 2007 compared to 2006 Consolidated operating expenses increased by $8.202 billion, or 20.0%, in 2007 compared with 2006. Currency fluctuations in our International Package and Supply Chain & Freight segments resulted in consolidated operating expenses increasing by $471 million for the year. Compensation and benefits expense increased by $7.324 billion for the year, and was impacted by several items including the charge for the withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund, higher wage rates in the union workforce, increased stock-based compensation, higher expense for union pension and welfare programs, the SVSO charge, and the restructuring charge in our Supply Chain & Freight business in France. These increases were slightly offset by lower workers compensation expense. Our national master agreement with the Teamsters allowed us, upon ratification, to withdraw employees from the Central States Pension Fund and to establish a jointly trusteed single-employer plan for this group (“UPS IBT Pension Plan”). Upon ratification of the contract in December 2007 and our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund, we recorded a pre-tax $6.100 billion charge to establish our withdrawal liability, and made a December 2007 payment in the same amount to the Central States Pension Fund to satisfy this liability. The withdrawal liability was based on computations performed by independent actuaries employed by the Central States Pension Fund, in accordance with the plan document and the applicable requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”). We negotiated our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund as part of our national master agreement with the Teamsters, which included other modifications to hourly wage rates, healthcare and pension benefits, and work rules. We sought to negotiate our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund, as we believed the fund would likely continue to have funding challenges, and would present a risk to UPS of having to face higher future contribution requirements and a risk to the security of the pension benefits of those UPS employees who participated in the fund. We believe that we benefited financially from the ability to achieve a ratified national master agreement seven months before the expiration of the previous agreement, as well as by gaining better control over the future cost and funding of pension benefits by limiting our obligations solely to UPS Teamster employees through the new UPS IBT Pension Plan. As the UPS IBT Pension Plan matures, we believe that it will become cost beneficial from a cash flow and earnings standpoint compared with having remained in the Central States Pension Fund. In December 2006, we offered the SVSO to approximately 640 employees who work in non-operating functions. This program was established to improve the efficiency of non-operating processes by eliminating duplication and sharing expertise across the company. The SVSO ended in February 2007, and 195, or 30% of eligible employees, accepted the offer. As a result, we recorded a charge to expense of $68 million in the first quarter of 2007, to reflect the cash payout and the acceleration of stock compensation and certain retiree healthcare benefits under the SVSO program. In the third quarter of 2007, we initiated a restructuring plan for our forwarding and logistics operations in France. The objective of this restructuring plan was to reduce our forwarding and logistics cost structure and focus on profitable revenue growth in the Europe region. The restructuring principally consisted of an employment reduction program, which was ratified by our company’s trade union representatives in France in 29 Table of Contents July 2007. Employees participating in this program were entitled to severance benefits, including certain bonuses for employees participating in the voluntary termination phase. These severance benefits were formula-driven and were in accordance with French statutory laws as well as the applicable collective bargaining agreements. We recorded a restructuring charge of $46 million ($42 million related to severance costs, and thus recorded in compensation and benefits expense) in 2007 related to this program. Stock-based and other management incentive compensation expense increased $113 million, or 17.7%, during 2007, primarily due to 2007 awards of stock options, restricted performance units, and restricted stock units. Pension and healthcare expense increased during the year, largely due to higher expense associated with plans covering union employees, but was somewhat offset by a $59 million decrease in expense for the UPS-sponsored pension plans in the U.S. The expense associated with our self-insurance accruals for workers’ compensation claims, automotive liability and general business liabilities was $46 million lower in 2007 compared with 2006. Insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Recorded balances are based on reserve levels, which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. The lower expense reflects favorable claims experience resulting from several company initiatives put into place over the last several years and other factors, including initiatives to decrease accident frequencies, improved oversight and management of claims, improved trends in health care costs, and favorable state legislative reforms. The 0.2% increase in repairs and maintenance reflects higher maintenance expense on aircraft, largely offset by lower maintenance expense on vehicles and buildings. The 0.2% decrease in depreciation and amortization was influenced by several factors, including lower depreciation expense on aircraft and amortization expense on capitalized software, partially offset by increased depreciation expense on vehicles. The 7.4% increase in purchased transportation was impacted by volume growth in our International Package business and currency fluctuations, as well as growth in our international forwarding business. The 12.0% increase in fuel expense for the year was primarily due to higher prices for jet and diesel fuel, as well as higher usage, but was partially mitigated by hedging gains. Other occupancy expense increased 2.1% for the year, and was affected by increased rent expense and property taxes, but partially offset by lower utilities expense. The 3.0% increase in other expenses for the year was affected by a $221 million aircraft impairment charge, discussed further below, but partially offset with cost controls in several areas. The comparison in other expenses was also affected by an $87 million charge to settle class action litigation in 2006. As a result of business changes that occurred in the first quarter of 2007, including capacity-optimization programs in our domestic and international air freight forwarding business as well as changes to our aircraft orders and planned delivery dates, we began a review process of our aircraft fleet types to ensure that we maintain the optimum mix of aircraft types to service our international and domestic package businesses. The review was completed in March 2007, and based on the results of our evaluation we accelerated the planned retirement of certain Boeing 727 and 747 aircraft, and recognized an impairment and obsolescence charge of $221 million for the aircraft and related engines and parts in 2007. This charge is included in the caption “Other expenses” in the Statement of Consolidated Income, of which $159 million impacted our U.S. Domestic Package segment and $62 million impacted our International Package segment. Investment Income and Interest Expense 2008 compared to 2007 The decrease in investment income of $24 million was primarily due to a lower average balance of interest-earning investments, investment impairment charges, and a lower yield earned on our investments. During 2008, we recorded impairment losses on two auction rate securities that were collateralized by preferred stock issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”). The impairment followed actions by the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Housing 30 Table of Contents Finance Agency with respect to FNMA and FHLMC. Additionally, we recorded impairment losses on a municipal auction rate security and on holdings of several medium term notes issued by Lehman Brothers Inc., which declared bankruptcy during 2008. We do not hold any other securities in any of these entities. The total of these credit-related impairment losses during 2008 was $23 million, which was recorded in investment income on the income statement. Interest expense increased $196 million in 2008, primarily due to a higher average balance of outstanding debt. In early 2008, we completed the issuance of $4.0 billion in long-term debt, the proceeds of which were used to reduce our commercial paper balance. Our commercial paper balances had previously increased to fund the $6.100 billion Central States Pension Fund withdrawal payment in December 2007. The impact of increased debt balances was partially mitigated, however, by lower average rates incurred on our variable rate debt and interest rate swap agreements as a result of declines in short-term interest rates in the United States throughout 2008. 2007 compared to 2006 The increase in investment income of $13 million was primarily due to higher realized gains on sales of investments, but partially offset by a lower average balance of interest-earning investments and increased equity-method losses on investment partnerships. Interest expense increased $35 million in 2007, primarily due to higher average debt balances outstanding, largely related to commercial paper. Our commercial paper balances increased in the fourth quarter of 2007, causing a corresponding increase in interest expense, as a result of the payment made to withdraw from the Central States Pension Fund. Increased interest charges were somewhat offset, however, by higher capitalized interest related to various construction projects, including aircraft purchases and our Worldport expansion. Income Tax Expense 2008 compared to 2007 Income tax expense increased by $1.963 billion in 2008 compared with 2007, primarily due to higher pre-tax income. Pre-tax income in 2007 was adversely impacted by the Central States withdrawal charge, as noted previously. The effective tax rate was 40.1% in 2008, compared with 11.4% in 2007. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to several factors resulting from the Central States withdrawal charge in 2007. These factors included having proportionally lower tax credits in 2008, and the effect of having a much higher proportion of our taxable income in 2008 being subject to tax in the United States, whereas a relatively greater proportion of taxable income in 2007 was subject to tax outside the United States, where effective tax rates are generally lower. The effective tax rate in 2008 was also 4.1 percentage points higher due to the lack of tax deductibility of the $548 million goodwill and $27 million intangible impairment charges discussed previously. 2007 compared to 2006 Income tax expense declined by $2.259 billion in 2007 compared with 2006, due to lower pre-tax income primarily resulting from the Central States Pension Fund withdrawal charge. The effective tax rate was 11.4% in 2007 and 35.5% in 2006. During 2007, our effective tax rate was reduced primarily due to proportionally higher tax credits and the effect of having a relatively larger proportion of our taxable income being earned in international jurisdictions with lower tax rates. Net Income and Earnings Per Share 2008 compared to 2007 Net income for 2008 was $3.003 billion, compared with the $382 million achieved in 2007, resulting in an increase in diluted earnings per share to $2.94 in 2008 from $0.36 in 2007. The increase in net income was largely due to the absence in 2008 of some of the previously discussed charges to expense in 2007. In 2007, net 31 Table of Contents income was negatively impacted by the after-tax impact of the charge recorded to reflect our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund ($3.772 billion), the charge related to the restructuring and disposal of certain logistics operations in France ($31 million), the aircraft impairment charge ($141 million), and SVSO charge ($43 million). The combination of these four charges reduced 2007 diluted earnings per share by $3.75. In 2008, net income was adversely affected by the UPS Freight goodwill impairment charge ($548 million) and customer list intangible asset impairment charge in the United Kingdom ($27 million). The combination of these two charges reduced 2008 diluted earnings per share by $0.56. Net income during 2008 was also adversely impacted by the deteriorating worldwide economic situation, as previously discussed. Earnings per share was favorably impacted by a reduction in outstanding shares as a result of our ongoing share repurchase program, as the total number of outstanding shares declined by 4.3% during 2008. 2007 compared to 2006 Net income for 2007 was $382 million, a decrease from the $4.202 billion achieved in 2006, resulting in a decrease in diluted earnings per share to $0.36 in 2007 from $3.86 in 2006. This decrease in net income was largely due to the after-tax $3.772 billion charge recorded to reflect our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund. Additionally, 2007 net income was adversely impacted by $31 million as a result of the restructuring charge in our France Supply Chain & Freight business, $141 million as a result of the aircraft impairment charge, and $43 million as a result of the SVSO charge. These items were partially offset by the improved results in our International Package and Supply Chain & Freight segments. The reduction in basic and diluted earnings per share were largely due to the pension withdrawal, aircraft impairment, France restructuring, and SVSO charges noted above. These items reduced basic and diluted earnings per share by $3.77 and $3.75 in 2007. Earnings per share was favorably impacted by a reduction in outstanding shares as a result of our ongoing share repurchase program, as the total number of outstanding shares declined by 2.7% during 2007. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $8.426, $1.123, and $5.589 billion in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The increase in 2008 operating cash flows compared with 2007 was impacted by several items, including changes in pension fundings, tax payments and refunds, and rates for our delivery services. In 2007, operating cash flow was adversely impacted by the $6.100 billion payment made to withdraw from the Central States Pension Fund. Total contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans declined in 2008 compared with 2007, even excluding the Central States Pension Fund withdrawal payment. As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, total multiemployer pension plan fundings decreased by $473 million in 2008 compared with 2007 (excluding the $6.100 billion withdrawal charge in 2007), largely due to the lack of contributions to the Central States Pension Fund in 2008 subsequent to our withdrawal. Additionally, contributions to our company-sponsored pension and postretirement plans declined by $441 million in 2008 compared with 2007, as we had no material minimum funding requirements in 2008 and we made no significant discretionary contributions to our plans. As discussed further in the “Contractual Commitments” section, we do have minimum funding requirements in the next several years, primarily related to the UPS IBT Pension Plan. The increase in operating cash flow was also favorably impacted by the timing of tax refunds and estimated tax payments in both 2008 and 2007. In 2008, we received an $850 million U.S. federal tax refund due to prior overpayments of our estimated tax liability, primarily resulting from the deductibility of the Central States Pension Fund withdrawal payment for tax purposes. Additionally, the amount of U.S. federal quarterly estimated 32 Table of Contents income tax payments was lower in 2007 compared with 2006, also primarily relating to the deductibility of the pension withdrawal payment. As of December 31, 2008, we have received substantially all of the expected cash tax benefits resulting from the withdrawal payment. Changes in package volume and pricing affect operating cash flow. As noted previously, we increased rates in our package delivery and LTL services at the end of 2007. Additionally, in October 2008, we announced a base rate increase and a change in the fuel surcharge that took effect on January 5, 2009. We increased the base rates 6.9% on UPS Next Day Air, UPS 2nd Day Air, and UPS 3 Day Select, and 5.9% on UPS Ground. We also increased the base rates 6.9% for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Express Plus, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service). Other pricing changes included a $0.10 increase in the residential surcharge, and an increase of $0.10 in the delivery area surcharge on both residential and commercial services to certain ZIP codes. These rate changes are customary, and are consistent with previous years’ rate increases. Additionally, we modified the fuel surcharge on domestic and U.S.-origin international air services by reducing by 2% the index used to determine the fuel surcharge. The UPS Ground fuel surcharge continues to fluctuate based on the U.S. Energy Department’s On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market. In October 2008, UPS Freight announced a general rate increase averaging 5.9% covering non-contractual shipments in the United States and Canada. The increase took effect on January 5, 2009, and applies to minimum charge, LTL and TL rates. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $3.179, $2.199, and $2.340 billion in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The increase in cash used in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to increased net purchases of marketable securities. Net (purchases) sales of marketable securities were ($278), $621, and $482 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The net sales of marketable securities in 2007 and 2006 were primarily used to fund our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans, as well as to repurchase shares. Capital expenditures represent a primary use of cash in investing activities, as follows (in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Buildings and facilities $ 968 $ 853 $ 720 Aircraft and parts 852 1,137 1,150 Vehicles 539 492 831 Information technology 277 338 384 $ 2,636 $ 2,820 $ 3,085 As described in the “Contractual Commitments” section below, we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft, vehicles, equipment and other fixed assets to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth. We fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations. The reduction in capital expenditures was largely due to the timing of aircraft deliveries. Capital expenditures on buildings and facilities increased in 2008, primarily resulting from our Worldport hub expansion, as well as the expansion and new construction projects at other facilities in Europe, Canada, and China. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we opened our new international air hub in Shanghai, China, and also began construction of our new intra-Asia air hub in Shenzhen, China. We had a net cash use of $49 and $39 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, and net cash generation of $68 million in 2006, due to originations, sales, and customer paydowns of finance receivables, primarily in our commercial lending, asset-based lending, and leasing portfolios. 33 Table of Contents Other investing activities reflected a cash outflow of $363 million in 2008 as compared with a $46 million outflow in 2007 and a $120 million cash inflow in 2006, and was impacted by cash settlements of derivative contracts used in our energy and currency hedging programs, the timing of aircraft purchase contract deposits on our Boeing 767-300 and Boeing 747-400 aircraft orders, and increases in restricted cash balances. In 2008, we entered into an escrow agreement with an insurance carrier to guarantee our self-insurance obligations. This agreement required us to provide $191 million in cash collateral to the insurance carrier, which is classified as restricted cash within other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008. We received (paid) cash related to purchases and settlements of energy and currency derivative contracts of ($208), ($140), and $233 million during 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Financing Activities Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(6.702), $2.297, and ($3.851) billion in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Our primary uses of cash flows for financing activities are to repurchase shares, pay cash dividends, and make debt principal repayments. We repaid debt principal, net of issuances, of $921 million in 2008, compared with net issuances of debt of $6.509 billion in 2007. In 2007, we increased our commercial paper borrowings to fund the $6.100 billion withdrawal payment to the Central States Pension Fund (commercial paper increased $6.575 billion at December 31, 2007 over December 31, 2006) upon ratification of our labor contract with the Teamsters, as previously discussed. In 2008, we repaid most of this commercial paper with the proceeds from a $4.0 billion senior notes offering, as well as the $850 million U.S. federal tax refund received. In January 2008, we completed an offering of $1.750 billion of 4.50% senior notes due January 2013, $750 million of 5.50% senior notes due January 2018, and $1.500 billion of 6.20% senior notes due January 2038. All of these notes pay interest semiannually, and allow for redemption of the notes by UPS at any time by paying the greater of the principal amount or a “make-whole” amount, plus accrued interest. After pricing and underwriting discounts, we received a total of $3.961 billion in cash proceeds from the offering. Concurrent with the issuance these notes, we settled certain derivatives that were designated as hedges of the notes offering, resulting in a cash outflow of $84 million (which is reported in other financing activities on the cash flow statement). Other than commercial paper, repayments of debt consisted primarily of scheduled principal payments on our capital lease obligations, redemption of certain tranches of UPS Notes, and principal payments on debt related to our investment in certain partnerships. During 2008, we called for the redemption of $327 million of notes issued under our UPS Notes program, and the associated swaps on the notes were terminated. We consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non-scheduled repayments of debt. In January 2008, we announced a new financial policy regarding our capital structure to enhance shareowner value. We intend to manage our balance sheet to a target debt ratio of approximately 50%-60% funds from operations to total debt. In connection with this policy, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in our share repurchase authorization to $10.0 billion. Share repurchases may take the form of accelerated share repurchases, open market purchases, or other such methods as we deem appropriate. The timing of our share repurchases will depend upon market conditions. Unless terminated earlier by the resolution of our Board, the program will expire when we have purchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the program. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we repurchased a total of 53.6, 35.9, and 32.6 million shares of Class A and Class B common stock for $3.558, $2.618, and $2.455 billion, respectively ($3.570, $2.639, and $2.460 billion reported on the statement of cash flows due to timing of settlements). Our quarterly cash dividends declared were $0.45, $0.42, and $0.38 per share in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Additionally, in 2008 the Board of Directors approved an earlier payment schedule for the November dividend declaration, as in prior years this dividend was payable the following January. As a result, a total of five dividend payments were made in 2008. This extra dividend payment, along with the higher quarterly 34 Table of Contents dividend per share, resulted in an increase in total cash dividends paid to $2.219 billion in 2008 from $1.703 billion in 2007 and $1.577 billion in 2006. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other relevant factors. We expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends. On February 11, 2009, our Board declared a dividend of $0.45 per share, which is payable on March 10, 2009 to shareowners of record on February 23, 2009. Sources of Credit We are authorized to borrow up to $10.0 billion under our U.S. commercial paper program. We had $2.922 billion outstanding under this program as of December 31, 2008, with an average interest rate of 0.55%. At December 31, 2008, we classified $1.0 billion of our commercial paper as long-term debt on our balance sheet, based on our intent and ability to refinance this debt on a long-term basis in the future. We also maintain a European commercial paper program under which we are authorized to borrow up to €1.0 billion in a variety of currencies, however no amounts were outstanding under this program as of December 31, 2008. We maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks. One of these agreements provides revolving credit facilities of $4.5 billion, and expires on April 16, 2009. The second agreement provides revolving credit facilities of $1.0 billion, and expires on April 19, 2012. Interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at 90-day LIBOR plus 15 basis points. At December 31, 2008, there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities. In addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC that is available for registered offerings of short or long-term debt securities. As of December 31, 2008, our Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) short-term credit ratings were P-1 and A-1+, respectively, and our Moody’s and S&P long-term credit ratings were Aa2 and AA-, respectively, with a stable outlook from both of these credit rating agencies. Our existing debt instruments and credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, however these debt instruments and credit facilities do subject us to certain financial covenants. These covenants limit the amount of secured indebtedness that may be incurred by the Company, and limit the amount of sale-leaseback transactions that the Company may engage in, to 10% of net tangible assets each. As of December 31, 2008 and for all prior periods, we have satisfied these financial covenants. As of December 31, 2008, 10% of net tangible assets is equivalent to $2.156 billion, however we have no qualifying sale-leaseback transactions or secured indebtedness outstanding. We do not expect these covenants to have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity. Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity. 35 Table of Contents Contractual Commitments We have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of capital leases, operating leases, debt obligations, purchase commitments, pension fundings, and certain other liabilities. We intend to satisfy these obligations through the use of cash flow from operations. The following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2008 (in millions): Year CapitalLeases OperatingLeases DebtPrincipal DebtInterest PurchaseCommitments PensionFundings OtherLiabilities 2009 $ 83 $ 344 $ 2,007 $ 331 $ 708 $ 778 $ 74 2010 121 288 18 326 658 593 71 2011 29 217 5 326 667 828 69 2012 30 147 22 325 406 945 67 2013 31 109 1,768 285 — 964 65 After 2013 246 423 5,658 4,526 — — 139 Total $ 540 $ 1,528 $ 9,478 $ 6,119 $ 2,439 $ 4,108 $ 485 Our capital lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft. Capital leases, operating leases, and purchase commitments, as well as our debt principal obligations, are discussed further in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. The amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixed-rate debt, in addition to interest on variable rate debt that was calculated based on interest rates as of December 31, 2008. The calculations of debt interest do not take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements. For debt denominated in a foreign currency, the U.S. Dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to calculate future interest payments. Purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding, the largest of which are orders for aircraft, engines, and parts. As of December 31, 2008, we maintain orders for 27 Boeing 767-300ER freighters to be delivered between 2009 and 2012, and five Boeing 747-400F aircraft scheduled for delivery during 2009 and 2010. These aircraft purchase orders will provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth. Pension fundings represent the anticipated required cash contributions that will be made to the UPS IBT Pension Plan, which was established upon ratification of the national master agreement with the Teamsters, as well as the UPS Retirement Plan and the UPS Pension Plan. These plans are discussed further in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The pension funding requirements were estimated under the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, using discount rates, asset returns, and other assumptions appropriate for these plans. To the extent that the funded status of these plans in future years differs from our current projections, the actual contributions made in future years could materially differ from the amounts shown in the table above. As a result of losses experienced in the global equity markets, our U.S. domestic pension plans experienced a negative return on assets of approximately 26% in 2008, however these losses did not trigger any minimum funding requirement for contributions in 2009 in the UPS Retirement Plan or UPS Pension Plan. The amount of any minimum funding requirement, as applicable, for these plans could change significantly in future periods, depending on many factors, including future plan asset returns and discount rates. A sustained significant decline in the world equity markets, and the resulting impact on our pension assets and investment returns, could result in our domestic pension plans being subject to significantly higher minimum funding requirements. Such an outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and cash flows in future periods. The contractual payments due under the “other liabilities” column primarily includes commitment payments related to our investment in certain partnerships. The table above does not include approximately $388 million of unrecognized tax benefits that have been recognized as liabilities in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, 36 Table of Contents “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”), because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash. In addition, although we have recognized and disclosed unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with FIN 48, we also have outstanding recognized tax benefits in excess of the recorded liabilities such that we do not believe a net contractual obligation exists to the taxing authorities. FIN 48 is discussed further in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2008, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $2.132 billion issued in connection with routine business requirements. We also issue surety bonds as an alternative to letters of credit in certain instances, and as of December 31, 2008, we had $262 million of surety bonds written. As of December 31, 2008, we had unfunded loan commitments totaling $885 million associated with our financial business. We believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long-term needs for the operation of our business, including anticipated capital expenditures, such as commitments for aircraft purchases, for the foreseeable future. Contingencies We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various class-action allegations under state wage-and-hour laws. In one of these cases, Marlo v. UPS, which was certified as a class action in a California federal court in June 2004, plaintiffs allege that they improperly were denied overtime, and seek penalties for missed meal and rest periods, and interest and attorneys’ fees. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of 1,300 full-time supervisors. In August 2005, the court granted summary judgment in favor of UPS on all claims, and plaintiff appealed the ruling. In October 2007, the appeals court reversed the lower court’s ruling. In April 2008, the Court decertified the class and vacated the trial scheduled for April 29, 2008. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. In another case, Hohider v. UPS, which in July 2007 was certified as a class action in a Pennsylvania federal court, plaintiffs have challenged certain aspects of the Company’s interactive process for assessing requests for reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Plaintiffs purport to represent a class of over 35,000 current and former employees, and seek back-pay, and compensatory and punitive damages, as well as attorneys’ fees. In August 2007, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Company’s Petition to hear the appeal of the trial court’s certification order. Oral argument took place in November 2008. The appeal will likely take one year. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this case. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. UPS and Mail Boxes Etc., Inc. are defendants in various lawsuits brought by franchisees who operate Mail Boxes Etc. centers and The UPS Store locations. These lawsuits relate to the rebranding of Mail Boxes Etc. centers to The UPS Store, The UPS Store business model, the representations made in connection with the rebranding and the sale of The UPS Store franchises, and UPS’s sale of services in the franchisees’ territories. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. At this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from these matters or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. UPS Freight, along with several other companies involved in the LTL freight business, is a defendant in a Multi-District Litigation pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The lawsuits allege that the defendants conspired to fix fuel surcharge rates, and they seek injunctive relief, treble damages and attorneys’ fees. We have denied any liability with respect to these claims and intend to vigorously 37 Table of Contents defend ourselves in these cases, and defendants’ motion to dismiss is pending for decision by the Court. These cases are at a preliminary stage and at this time, we have not determined the amount of any liability that may result from this matter or whether such liability, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. We are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business. We believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, most U.S. state and local jurisdictions, and many non-U.S. jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2008, we had substantially resolved all U.S. federal income tax matters for tax years prior to 1999. In February and July 2008, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) completed its audit of the tax years 1999 through 2002 and tax years 2003 through 2004, respectively, with only a limited number of issues that will be considered by the IRS Appeals Office by the end of 2009. In late 2008, the IRS began the initial planning phase of the income tax audit for tax years 2005 through 2007. Along with this audit for tax years 2005 through 2007, the IRS is currently examining non-income based taxes, including employment and excise taxes on transportation of property by air and fuel purchases, which could lead to proposed assessments. The IRS has not presented an official position with regard to these taxes at this time, and therefore we are not able to determine the technical merit of any potential assessment; however, we do not believe that the resolution of this matter would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. state and local and non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years prior to 1999, but certain U.S. state and local matters are subject to ongoing litigation. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately 260,000 employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the Teamsters. In September 2007, we reached a new national master agreement with the Teamsters, which was ratified in December 2007. The new agreement provides for wage increases as well as contributions to healthcare and pension plans, and most economic provisions of the new five year agreement took effect on August 1, 2008, with the exception of our withdrawal from the Central States Pension Fund which occurred in 2007. We have approximately 2,900 pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association, which becomes amendable at the end of 2011. Our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727, which became amendable in November 2006. We began formal negotiations with Teamsters Local 2727 in October 2006. In addition, the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (approximately 3,000). These agreements run through July 31, 2009. We participate in a number of trustee-managed multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. Several factors could cause us to make significantly higher future contributions to these plans, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in demographics, and increased benefits to participants. At this time, we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions, if any, or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity would result from our participation in these plans. Other Matters We received grand jury subpoenas from the Antitrust Division of the DOJ regarding the DOJ’s investigations into certain pricing practices in the air cargo industry in July 2006, and into certain pricing practices in the freight forwarding industry in December 2007. In October 2007 and June 2008, we received information requests from the European Commission relating to its investigation of certain pricing practices in the freight forwarding industry. We also received and responded to related information requests from competition authorities in other jurisdictions. We are cooperating with these inquiries. 38 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements” (“FAS 157”), which was issued to define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value, and expand disclosures about fair value measurements, and is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB deferred the effective date of FAS 157 for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities, and removed certain leasing transactions from its scope. We adopted FAS 157 on January 1, 2008, and the impact of adoption was not material to our results of operations or financial condition. The disclosures required by FAS 157 are discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 158 “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R))” (“FAS 158”). This statement requires us to recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the balance sheet, and required delayed recognition items, consisting of actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits, to be recognized in other comprehensive income and subsequently amortized to the income statement. On December 31, 2006, we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of FAS 158, which resulted in a reduction to AOCI of $2.097 billion and a reduction of long-term deferred tax liabilities of $1.258 billion. Additionally, we previously utilized the early measurement date option available under Statement No. 87 “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions”, and we measured the funded status of our plans as of September 30 each year. Under the provisions of FAS 158, we were required to use a December 31 measurement date for all of our pension and postretirement benefit plans beginning in 2008. As a result of this change in measurement date, we recorded a cumulative effect after-tax $44 million reduction to retained earnings as of January 1, 2008. The adoption of FAS 158 is discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159 “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“FAS 159”), which gives entities the option to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value (i.e., the fair value option), on an instrument-by-instrument basis, that are otherwise not accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards. The election to use the fair value option is available at specified election dates, such as when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or financial liability or upon entering into a firm commitment. Subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings. Additionally, FAS 159 allows for a one-time election for existing positions upon adoption, with the transition adjustment recorded to beginning retained earnings. We adopted FAS 159 on January 1, 2008, and elected to apply the fair value option to our investment in certain investment partnerships that were previously accounted for under the equity method. Accordingly, we recorded a $16 million reduction to retained earnings as of January 1, 2008, representing the cumulative effect adjustment of adopting FAS 159. The adoption of FAS 159 is discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 requires that we determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets this recognition threshold, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. On January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FIN 48, and the impact of this Interpretation is discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. In June 2007, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 06-11, “Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards.” EITF 06-11 requires that the tax benefit related to dividend equivalents paid on restricted stock units, which are expected to vest, be recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital. EITF 06-11 is applied prospectively for tax benefits on dividends declared in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007. We adopted the provisions of EITF 06-11 beginning in the first quarter of 2008. This adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. 39 Table of Contents In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141(R) “Business Combinations” (“FAS 141(R)”). FAS 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction (whether a full or partial acquisition); establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; requires expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs; and requires the acquirer to disclose in its financial statements the information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. FAS 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. The impact of FAS No. 141(R) on our consolidated financial statements will depend upon the nature, terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51” (“FAS 160”). FAS 160 requires reporting entities to present noncontrolling (minority) interests as equity (as opposed to as a liability or mezzanine equity) and provides guidance on the accounting for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $5 million in noncontrolling interests classified in other non-current liabilities. FAS 160 applies prospectively as of January 1, 2009, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented. In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (“FAS 161”), which requires additional disclosures about the objectives of derivative instruments and hedging activities, the method of accounting for such instruments under FAS 133 and its related interpretations, and a tabular disclosure of the effects of such instruments and related hedged items on our financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. We adopted FAS 161 on January 1, 2009. FAS 161 only impacts our disclosures, and does not impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. These new disclosures will be required for us beginning in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009. In October 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 157-3, “Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active” (“FSP 157-3”). FSP 157-3 clarifies the application of FAS 157, which we adopted as of January 1, 2008, in cases where a market is not active. We have considered the guidance provided by FSP 157-3 in our determination of estimated fair values as of December 31, 2008, and the impact was not material. In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosure about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets”, which amends Statement 132(R) to require more detailed disclosures about employers’ pension plan assets. New disclosures will include more information on investment strategies, major categories of assets, concentrations of risk within plan assets, and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets. This new standard requires new disclosures only, and will have no impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. These new disclosures will be required for us beginning in our Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2009. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As indicated in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles. We base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates, which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements. While estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts, we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. 40 Table of Contents Contingencies—As discussed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies. We have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies” (“FAS 5”). FAS 5 requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency. The actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates. If a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate, a future charge to income would result. Likewise, if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate, a future credit to income would result. The events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable. At the time a contingency is identified, we consider all relevant facts as part of our FAS 5 evaluation. We record a liability for a loss that meets the recognition criteria of FAS 5. These criteria require recognition of a liability when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable. Events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability. These factors could result in a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. Contingent losses that meet the recognition criteria under FAS 5, excluding those related to income taxes and self insurance which are discussed further below, were not material to the Company’s financial position as of December 31, 2008. In addition, we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of December 31, 2008, because a loss is not reasonably estimable. Goodwill and Intangible Impairment—We account for goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“FAS 142”), which requires annual impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting units. Our reporting units are comprised of the Europe, Asia, and Americas reporting units in the International Package reporting segment, and the Forwarding & Logistics, UPS Freight, MBE / UPS Store, and UPS Capital reporting units in the Supply Chain & Freight reporting segment. Our annual goodwill impairment testing date is October 1st for each reporting unit. The impairment test involves a two-step process. First, a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying values, including goodwill, is performed. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. We primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model (“DCF model”), and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies, as applicable. The completion of the DCF model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows. These assumptions include projections of future revenue, costs and working capital changes. In addition, we make assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables, as required, in estimating the fair value of our reporting units. The projections that we use in our DCF model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units. The determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions, and changes in our business strategy, government regulations, or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments. We will continue to monitor market conditions and other factors to determine if interim impairment tests are necessary in future periods. If impairment indicators are present in future periods, the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and determined that our UPS Freight reporting unit, which was formed through the acquisition of Overnite Corporation in 2005, had a goodwill impairment of $548 million. This impairment charge resulted from several factors, including a lower cash flow forecast due to a longer estimated economic recovery time for the LTL sector, and significant deterioration in equity valuations for other similar LTL industry participants. At the time of acquisition of Overnite Corporation, LTL equity valuations were higher and the economy was significantly stronger. We invested in operational improvements and technology upgrades to enhance service and performance, as well as 41 Table of Contents expand service offerings. However, this process took longer than initially anticipated, and thus financial results have been below our expectations. Additionally, the LTL sector in 2008 has been adversely impacted by the economic recession in the U.S., lower industrial production and retail sales, volatile fuel prices, and significant levels of price-based competition. By the fourth quarter of 2008, the combination of these internal and external factors reduced our near term expectations for this unit, leading to the goodwill impairment charge. None of the other reporting units incurred an impairment of goodwill in 2008, nor did we have any goodwill impairment charges in 2007 or 2006. All of our recorded intangible assets other than goodwill are deemed to be finite-lived intangibles, and are thus amortized over their estimated useful lives. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“FAS 144”), impairment tests for these intangible assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the intangible. If the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. Fair values are determined based on a DCF model. As a result of weak performance in our domestic U.K. package operations, we reviewed our intangible assets for impairment within our U.K. domestic package entity. Based on recent performance and near-term projections, the value assigned to a customer list intangible asset acquired within the UK domestic package business was determined to be impaired. This was the result of both higher than anticipated customer turnover and reduced operating margins associated with an acquired business. Accordingly, an intangible asset impairment charge of $27 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2008. No other intangible asset impairments were recognized in 2008, nor were any such impairments recognized in 2007 or 2006. Self-Insurance Accruals—We self-insure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims, automotive liability, health and welfare, and general business liabilities, up to certain limits. Insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Recorded balances are based on reserve levels, which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. Trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves. We believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate, but actual experience in claim frequency and/or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations. Workers’ compensation, automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle. Consequently, actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claims. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open, trends in health care costs and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. Changes in state legislation with respect to workers compensation can affect the adequacy of our self-insurance accruals. All of these factors can result in revisions to prior actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. We sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees. These liabilities and related expenses are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans, anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation. Actual results may differ from these estimates and, therefore, produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. Pension and Postretirement Medical Benefits—As discussed in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, we maintain several defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans. Our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than 42 Table of Contents Pensions.” These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, rate of compensation increases, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable, and represent our best estimates, based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends. Differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense. A 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate, expected return on assets, and health care cost trend rate for the U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans would result in the following increases (decreases) on the Company’s costs and obligations for the year 2008 (in millions): 25 Basis PointIncrease 25 Basis PointDecrease Pension Plans Discount Rate: Effect on net periodic benefit cost $ (44 ) $ 52 Effect on projected benefit obligation (605 ) 639 Return on Assets: Effect on net periodic benefit cost (42 ) 42 Postretirement Medical Plans Discount Rate: Effect on net periodic benefit cost (7 ) 6 Effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (80 ) 82 Health Care Cost Trend Rate: Effect on net periodic benefit cost 2 (3 ) Effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 25 (26 ) Fair Value Measurements—In the normal course of business, we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk, including derivatives, marketable securities, finance receivables, other investments, and debt. Certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value, principally derivatives, marketable securities, and certain other investments. Fair values are based on listed market prices, when such prices are available. To the extent that listed market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations. Certain financial instruments, including over-the-counter derivative instruments, are valued using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual and market prices, correlations, time value, credit spreads, and yield curve volatility factors. Changes in the fixed income, equity, foreign exchange, and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our results of operations. A quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices is presented in the “Market Risk” section of this report. Our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value have been categorized based upon a fair value hierarchy in accordance with FAS 157. Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are based on other observable market data, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as interest rates and yield curves. Level 3 inputs are developed from unobservable data reflecting our own assumptions, and include situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability. 43 Table of Contents The following is a general description of the valuation methodologies used for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value, including the general classification of such assets and liabilities pursuant to the valuation hierarchy. Derivative Contracts—Our foreign currency, interest rate, and energy derivatives are largely comprised of over-the-counter derivatives, which are primarily valued using pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as yield curves, currency exchange rates, and commodity forward prices, and therefore are classified as Level 2. Marketable Securities—Marketable securities utilizing Level 1 inputs include active exchange-traded equity securities and equity index funds, and most U.S. Government debt securities, as these securities all have quoted prices in active markets. Marketable securities utilizing Level 2 inputs include non-auction rate asset-backed securities, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds. These securities are valued using market corroborated pricing, matrix pricing, or other models that utilize observable inputs such as yield curves. We have classified our auction rate securities portfolio as utilizing Level 3 inputs, as their valuation requires substantial judgment and estimation of factors that are not currently observable in the market due to the lack of trading in the securities. These valuations may be revised in future periods as market conditions evolve. These securities were valued as of December 31, 2008 considering several factors, including the credit quality of the securities, the rate of interest received since the failed auctions began, the yields of securities similar to the underlying auction rate securities, and the input of broker-dealers in these securities. Other Investments—Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include our holdings in certain investment partnerships. These partnership holdings do not have any quoted prices, nor can they be valued using inputs based on observable market data. These investments are valued internally using a discounted cash flow model based on each partnership’s financial statements and cash flow projections. Depreciation, Residual Value, and Impairment of Fixed Assets—As of December 31, 2008, we had $18.265 billion of net fixed assets, the most significant category of which is aircraft. In accounting for fixed assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives and the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows generated by these assets. In estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft, we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types. Subsequent revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance program, changes in the utilization of the aircraft, governmental regulations on aging aircraft, and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, and adjust the estimates and assumptions as necessary. Adjustments to the expected lives and residual values are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense. In accordance with the provisions of FAS 144, we review long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows, or external appraisals, as applicable. We review long-lived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified. The circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include, but are not limited to, a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. In estimating cash flows, we project future volume levels for our different air express products in all geographic regions in which we do business. Adverse changes in these volume forecasts, or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections, could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand. This situation would lead to an excess of a particular aircraft type, resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type (thus resulting in increased depreciation expense). We continually monitor our aircraft fleet utilization in light of current and projected volume levels, aircraft fuel prices, and other factors. Changes in any of these factors, including a continuation of the rapid economic 44 Table of Contents decline experienced in the second half of 2008, could result in modifications to our current aircraft fleet plan. Such modifications could result in a reduction in the expected useful life of an aircraft type or in impairment losses related to the early retirement of particular aircraft. As a result of business changes that occurred in the first quarter of 2007, including capacity-optimization programs in our domestic and international air freight forwarding business as well as changes to our aircraft orders and planned delivery dates, we began a review process of our aircraft fleet types to ensure that we maintain the optimum mix of aircraft types to service our international and domestic package businesses. The review was completed in March 2007, and based on the results of our evaluation, we accelerated the planned retirement of certain Boeing 727 and 747 aircraft, and recognized an impairment and obsolescence charge of $221 million for the aircraft and related engines and parts in 2007. During 2006, we reevaluated the anticipated service lives of our Boeing 757, Boeing 767, and Airbus A300 fleets, and as a result of this evaluation, increased the depreciable lives from 20 to 30 years and reduced the residual values from 30% to 10% of original cost. This change did not have a material effect on our results of operations. Income Taxes—We make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction, tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. We assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. In the first quarter of 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of SFAS No. 109” (“FIN 48”), and related guidance (see Note 13 in the consolidated financial statements). As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process prescribed in the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Accounts Receivable—We utilize the reserve method for recognizing bad debt expense associated with our accounts receivable. This requires us to make our best estimate of the probable losses inherent in our customer receivables at each balance sheet date. These estimates require consideration of historical loss experience, adjusted for current conditions, trends in customer payment frequency, and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data, including present economic conditions and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors. Our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major account exposures and concentrations 45 Table of Contents of risk. Continued deterioration in macro economic variables could result in our ultimate loss exposures on our accounts receivable being significantly higher than what we have currently estimated and reserved for in our allowance for doubtful accounts. Our total allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $155 and $163 million, respectively. Our total provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $277, $225, and $159 million, respectively. Forward-Looking Statements “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and other parts of this report contain “forward-looking” statements about matters that inherently are difficult to predict. The words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “we see,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements include statements regarding our intent, belief and current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects and future results. We have described some of the important factors that affect these statements as we discussed each subject. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. 46 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. All of these market risks arise in the normal course of business, as we do not engage in speculative trading activities. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we utilize a variety of foreign exchange, interest rate, equity and commodity forward contracts, options, and swaps. The following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk. We utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates, interest rate yield curves, and commodity and equity prices. For options and instruments with non-linear returns, models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts. There are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. A discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels, principally jet-A, diesel, and unleaded gasoline. Currently, the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and LTL services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes. Additionally, we use a combination of options contracts to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy prices. The net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk, excluding the underlying exposures, as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 was an asset (liability) of $0 and $(179) million, respectively. The potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts, assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the underlying commodity price, would be approximately $0 and $42 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. This amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we terminated several energy derivatives and received $87 million in cash. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2006, we terminated several energy derivatives and received $229 million in cash. These transactions are reported in other investing activities in the statement of cash flows. As these derivatives qualified for hedge accounting, were designated as hedges, and maintained their effectiveness, the gains associated with these hedges were recognized in income over the original term of the hedges. The hedges that were terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008 will be recognized in the income statement through the first quarter of 2009. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, operating expenses, and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate. We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and the Canadian Dollar. We use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods of 12 to 24 months. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset (liability) of $241 and $(42) million, respectively. The potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately $239 and $387 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. This sensitivity analysis 47 Table of Contents assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates. Exchange rates rarely move in the same direction. The assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. Interest Rate Risk As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, we have issued debt instruments, including debt associated with capital leases, that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest. We use a combination of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. These swaps are generally entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify, and the notional amount, interest payment, and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt. We also utilize forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances. The net fair value of our interest rate swaps at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was a liability of $388 and $94 million, respectively. Our floating rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short-term (primarily LIBOR) interest rates. The potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in short-term interest rates applied to our floating rate debt and swap instruments (excluding hedges of anticipated debt issuances) at December 31, 2008 and 2007 would be approximately $41 and $100 million, respectively. We have investments in debt and preferred equity securities (including auction rate securities), as well as cash-equivalent instruments, some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest. The potential change in annual investment income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our investments exposed to variable interest rates at December 31, 2008 and 2007 would be approximately $6 and $15 million, respectively. Additionally, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest. The potential change in the annual income resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates applied to our variable rate finance receivables at December 31, 2008 and 2007 would be immaterial. This interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous, parallel shifts in the yield curve. In reality, interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios, these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts. We adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions. Equity Price Risk We hold investments in various common equity securities that are subject to price risk, and for certain of these securities, we utilize options to hedge this price risk. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the fair value of such investments was $30 and $35 million, respectively. The potential change in the fair value of such investments, assuming a 10% change in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges, would be approximately $3 and $4 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007. Credit Risk The forward contracts, swaps, and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. However, we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines. We do not expect to incur any material losses as a result of counterparty default. 48 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:10:37.592130
