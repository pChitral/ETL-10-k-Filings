Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Please read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Management’s Overview Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, the company began to be impacted by the economic, financial and real estate market crisis. To maintain its competitive advantage, the company established three key near-term priorities for 2009 which included: strengthening its balance sheet and liquidity position; reducing its cost structure; and positioning for future growth opportunities. Management believes that in 2009 it successfully executed on these near-term priorities, which enabled the company to navigate through a challenging environment, and that the company is now positioned to pursue growth opportunities. As such, the company has established three key growth initiatives for 2010, which include: • improving the utilization of its existing assets; • acquiring industrial real estate with total returns above the company’s cost of capital; and • forming new private capital ventures and funds. Management believes that the leading indicators for economic recovery reached an inflection point during the fourth quarter and expects that improving economic conditions will lead to an increase in the demand for industrial real estate. Management expects to see earnings growth if it is able to improve asset utilization by returning its owned and managed portfolio closer to its historical occupancy average of 95%; complete the build-out and leasing of its development portfolio; and realize value from its land bank through new ventures, sales and future build-to-suit projects. The company believes that capital deployment opportunities are increasing and is evaluating multiple transactions in its target markets around the globe. Management believes that its ability to provide multiple forms of consideration to institutional investors, lenders and private developers provide the company with proprietary access to acquisition opportunities. The company is also observing a positive shift in investor interest and believes that this growing level of interest is being met by the scarcity of high quality, well-located industrial real estate. Management believes that its existing and new private capital funds and ventures are well positioned to benefit from this shift in investor preferences. The Company’s Liquidity and Balance Sheet Management believes that the company’s financial position is strong and its debt maturity schedule is well laddered. During 2009, the company completed approximately $2.7 billion of debt repayments, repurchases and extensions, of which $1.6 billion occurred in the fourth quarter. Notable transactions during 2009, which further strengthened the company’s liquidity position included: • The issuance and sale of 47.4 million shares of its common stock for net proceeds of approximately $552.3 million, during the first quarter; • The issuance of $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes consisting of a $250.0 million tranche at 6.13% due 2016 and a $250.0 million tranche at 6.63% due 2019; • The refinancing of its $325.0 million unsecured term loan facility with a $345.0 million multi-currency facility, maturing October 2012, which was subsequently upsized to $425.0 million in December 2009; • The early repayment of its $230.0 million secured term loan facility originally due September 2010; • The completion of the repurchase of $213.6 million in bonds including $168.9 million in connection with its cash tender offer of notes due 2011 and 2013 and $44.7 million of open market repurchases of notes due 2010 and 2013 with a weighted average yield-to maturity of 4.74%, and the completion of a cash tender offer for $146.5 million and $28.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the operating partnership’s 5.45% medium-term notes due 2010 and 8.0% medium-term notes due 2010, respectively; and 52 Table of Contents • The purchase of AMB Property II, L.P.’s outstanding 7.18% series D cumulative redeemable preferred units in exchange for 2.9 million shares of the parent company’s common stock for an aggregate price of $67.8 million, which represented a 15% discount to the liquidation preference. As a result of its 2009 financing activity, the company reduced its share of total debt-to-its share of total assets to 43.6% from 51.1% and extended the weighted average remaining life of over 25% of its debt to more than five and a half years at an average interest rate of 4.9%. Having resolved its near-term maturities, the company embarked on a strategy, during the fourth quarter, to further lengthen its maturity schedule to minimize its debt maturities through 2013. Management believes this strategy will provide it with maximum flexibility and further position the company to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. As of December 31, 2009, the company’s total consolidated debt maturities for 2010 after extension options (subject to certain conditions) were $322.4 million, excluding principal amortization. The company had unconsolidated debt maturities of $148.2 million for 2010 after extension options (subject to certain conditions) as of December 31, 2009, excluding principal amortization. During 2009, the company disposed of $762.9 million of properties with a weighted average stabilized capitalization rate of 6.8%. During the fourth quarter, the company completed dispositions totaling $92.9 million, with a weighted average stabilized capitalization rate of 8.2%. During 2009, the company increased the availability under its lines of credit by approximately $441 million while reducing its share of outstanding debt by approximately $713 million. As of December 31, 2009, the company had $1.2 billion available for future borrowings under its three multi-currency lines of credit, representing line utilization of 30%, and had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $206.1 million. The Company’s Cost Structure To address the challenges of the current business environment, the company implemented a broad-based cost reduction plan that began in the fourth quarter of 2008. As a result of this plan, the company reduced its total global headcount by approximately one third and reduced gross G&A costs by approximately $60.0 million on a run-rate basis as of December 31, 2009. In executing these cost-saving efforts, the company believes that it has preserved its ability to serve its global customers and manage its industrial operating and development portfolios. While the company has removed excess capacity in its capital deployment teams, it believes that it has retained its key talent and left its global capabilities intact. During the fourth quarter, the company began the process of outsourcing various global property accounting and certain back office functions. The company believes that this initiative will improve the efficiency, cost structure and scalability of its back office operations. The company incurred $2.5 million in severance costs during the fourth quarter and expects to realize $2-3 million of additional restructuring costs in 2010 related to completing this initiative. Management believes that it will produce approximately $5.0 million in annual savings upon the completion of this initiative. Real Estate Operations During 2009, industrial property fundamentals were the most challenging on record. According to data provided by CBRE Econometric Advisors as of January 25, 2010, availability in the United States reached a historical high of 13.9% for the quarter ended December 31, 2009, up 40 basis points from the prior quarter and 250 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year 2009, industrial net absorption was negative 265 million square feet, the lowest on record. The negative trend decelerated over the course of the year, slowing to a negative 38 million square feet in the fourth quarter. Within the U.S., the company believes that its coastal markets will continue to outperform other U.S. industrial markets, as evidenced by flat net absorption and availability unchanged at 12.1% in the fourth quarter. The company continues to believe that the primary infill markets tied to global trade remain relatively strong. Also according to CBRE Econometric Advisors, new construction was at an all time low of 71 million square feet for 2009 and 15.2 million square feet for the fourth quarter. While the company expects the delivery pipeline to continue to decline, the company expects net absorption to be positive in the second half of 2010. At the end of the 53 Table of Contents third quarter, the global market fundamentals began to show early signs of stability. Globally, industrial demand is still soft, but management believes that it is seeing signs of increased customer activity and decision making. Market occupancy declines are slowing globally and leasing activity has increased. Market rents remain lower than a year ago and the company expects rent changes on rollovers to continue to trend down through 2010. Current forecasts for 2010, according to the IMF, indicate that global GDP is expected to increase by 3.9% and global trade by 6%, all of which should lead to inventory rebuilding and demand for industrial real estate. The company believes that while the leading indicators for demand for industrial real estate have reached an inflection point, recovery in operating fundamentals will lag behind the recovery in the macro economy as it has in prior cycles. Management expects that its operating fundamentals in the first half of 2010 will be consistent with occupancy in the fourth quarter of 2009 before improving by the end of 2010. Rent changes on rollover are expected to be negative for 2010. For 2009, the company generated $406.9 million of net operating income, on a consolidated basis, from its real estate operations. The company’s owned and managed portfolio occupancy during the three months ended December 31, 2009 was 91.2%, up 20 basis points from September 30, 2009. Average occupancy during the three months ended December 31, 2009 was 90.7%, up 30 basis points from the three months ended September 30, 2009. During the three months ended December 31, 2009, rent changes on rollovers in the company’s industrial operating portfolio declined by 11.5% on an owned and managed basis, excluding expense reimbursements, rental abatements, percentage rents and straight-line rents. Rental rates on lease renewals and rollovers in the company’s portfolio declined by 6.9% for the trailing four quarters ended December 31, 2009. During the quarter, cash-basis same store net operating income without the effect of lease termination fees, decreased by 7.3% and 4.5% for the full year 2009 on an owned and managed basis. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements against the U.S. dollar, cash-basis same store net operating income without the effect of lease termination fees decreased 8.9% for the fourth quarter and 4.7% for the full year 2009. See “Supplemental Earnings Measures” below for a discussion of cash-basis same store net operating income and a reconciliation of cash-basis same store net operating income and net income. As of December 31, 2009, the accounts receivable levels were consistent with historical levels, during recessionary periods, and management believes that the accounts receivable are leveling and that it continues to maintain adequate bad debt reserves. Although the number of bankruptcies of its customers increased during 2009, the company believes the impact of such bankruptcies on its business was not significant for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2009. Private Capital Business For the year ended December 31, 2009, the company generated private capital revenues of $37.9 million, of which $10.5 million occurred in the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, the company contributed one $185.0 million development project to AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. During the third quarter, the company transferred two assets to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. in exchange for additional units equal to the fair value of the assets, for an aggregate price of $32.5 million, increasing its ownership interest in the fund to 22.7% from 19.3%. Subsequent to year end, the company’s two open-ended funds completed approximately $267.0 million in net capital transactions consisting of: $50.0 million in new third-party equity in AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III; $67.0 million in investor-elected redemption withdrawals, thereby reducing AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III’s redemption queue to $14.9 million as of February 1, 2010; the company’s $100.0 million investment in AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III; and its $50.0 million investment in AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS. Equityholders in two of the company’s co-investment ventures, AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. and AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, have a right to request that the ventures redeem their interests under certain conditions. The redemption right of investors in AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS is exercisable beginning after July 1, 2011. Development Business Given the uncertainty in the global economy during 2009, the company limited its development activity to previously committed projects. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the company commenced development 54 Table of Contents on four previously committed development projects for a total estimated investment cost of $60.6 million. In addition to its committed development pipeline, as of December 31, 2009, the company held a total of 2,488 acres of land for future development or sale on an owned and managed basis, approximately 85% of which is located in the Americas. The company currently estimates that these 2,488 acres of land could support approximately 45.1 million square feet of future development. Impairment Charges The company recognized real estate impairment charges on certain of its assets of $181.9 million in the first quarter of 2009 and of $193.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The principal trigger which led to the impairment charges was the severe economic deterioration in some markets resulting in a decrease in leasing and rental rates, rising vacancies and an increase in capitalization rates. Additional impairments may be necessary in the future in the event that market conditions continue to deteriorate and impact the factors used to estimate fair value, which may include impairments relating to the company’s unconsolidated real estate as well as impairments relating to the company’s investments in its unconsolidated co-investment ventures. See Part IV, Item 15: Note 3 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a more detailed discussion of the real estate impairment losses recorded in the company’s results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2009. Summary of Key Transactions During the year ended December 31, 2009, the company completed the following significant capital deployment and other transactions: • Contributed one completed development project aggregating approximately 1.0 million square feet for an aggregate price of approximately $184.8 million (using the exchange rate in effect on the date of contribution) to AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., an unconsolidated co-investment venture; • Sold development projects aggregating approximately 3.1 million square feet, including 1.1 million square feet that was held in an unconsolidated co-investment venture, and three land parcels totaling 35 acres for an aggregate sales price of $347.5 million; • Sold industrial operating properties aggregating approximately 2.9 million square feet, including 0.6 million square feet that were held in an unconsolidated co-investment venture, for an aggregate sales price of $198.1 million; and • Transferred two development assets to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. in exchange for additional partnership units equal to the fair value of the assets for an aggregate price of $32.5 million and aggregating approximately 0.4 million square feet. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 4 and 5 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a more detailed discussion of the company’s acquisition, development and disposition activity. Critical Accounting Policies The company’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The company evaluates its assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis. The company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. 55 Table of Contents Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, an adjustment to the carrying value of the property is made to reduce it to its estimated fair value. The company also regularly reviews the impact of above or below-market leases, in-place leases and lease origination costs for acquisitions, and records an intangible asset or liability accordingly. The company conducts a comprehensive review of all real estate asset classes in accordance with its policy of accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, which indicates that asset values should be analyzed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable. The intended use of an asset, either held for sale or held for the long term, can significantly impact how impairment is measured. If an asset is intended to be held for the long term, the impairment analysis is based on a two-step test. The first test measures estimated expected future cash flows over the holding period, including a residual value (undiscounted and without interest charges), against the carrying value of the property. If the asset fails the test, then the asset carrying value is measured against the estimated fair value from a market participant standpoint, with the excess of the asset’s carrying value over the estimated fair value recognized as an impairment charge to earnings. If an asset is intended to be sold, impairment is tested based on a one-step test, comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value less costs to sell. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economic and market conditions and the availability of capital. The company determines the estimated fair values based on assumptions regarding rental rates, costs to complete, lease-up and holding periods, as well as sales prices or contribution values. The company also utilizes the knowledge of its regional teams and the recent valuations of its two open-ended funds, which contain a large, geographically diversified pool of assets, all of which are subject to third-party appraisals on at least an annual basis. Revenue Recognition. The company records rental revenue from operating leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases and maintains an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of the company’s customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than the company’s allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then the company may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. The company monitors the liquidity and creditworthiness of its customers on an on-going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate. Each period the company reviews its outstanding accounts receivable, including straight-line rents, for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed. The company also records lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with the company and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to the company. If a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customer’s occupancy. Property Dispositions. The company reports real estate dispositions in four separate categories on its consolidated statements of operations. First, when the company divests a portion of its interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by third-party investors for cash and are included in gains from sale or contribution of real estate interests in the statements of operations. Second, the company disposes of value-added conversion projects and build-to-suit and speculative development projects for which it has not generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable, and is included in development profits, net of taxes, within continuing operations of the statements of operations. Third, the company disposes of value-added conversion and other redevelopment projects for which it may have generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable, in the development profits, net of taxes, line within discontinued operations. Lastly, guidance related to accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets requires the company to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to industrial operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties, which is included in development profits and gains from sale of real estate interests, net of taxes, in the statements of operations. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also retrospectively adjusted to conform with new guidance regarding accounting for discontinued operations and noncontrolling interests, and there is no impact on the company’s previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or 56 Table of Contents cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met. Joint Ventures. The company holds interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. The company consolidates joint ventures where it exhibits financial or operational control. Control is determined using accounting standards related to the consolidation of joint ventures and variable interest entities. For joint ventures that are defined as variable interest entities, the primary beneficiary consolidates the entity. In instances where the company is not the primary beneficiary, it does not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures that are not defined as variable interest entities, management first considers whether the company is the general partner or a limited partner (or the equivalent in such investments which are not structured as partnerships). The company consolidates joint ventures where it is the general partner (or the equivalent) and the limited partners (or the equivalent) in such investments do not have rights which would preclude control and, therefore, consolidation for financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures where the company is the general partner (or the equivalent), but does not control the joint venture as the other partners (or the equivalent) hold substantive participating rights, the company uses the equity method of accounting. For joint ventures where the company is a limited partner (or the equivalent), management considers factors such as ownership interest, voting control, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners (or the equivalent) to determine if the presumption that the general partner controls the entity is overcome. In instances where these factors indicate the company controls the joint venture, the company consolidates the joint venture; otherwise it uses the equity method of accounting. Investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are presented under the equity method. Under the equity method, these investments are initially recognized in the balance sheet at cost and are subsequently adjusted to reflect the company’s proportionate share of net earnings or losses of the joint venture, distributions received, contributions, deferred gains from the contribution of properties and certain other adjustments, as appropriate. When circumstances indicate there may have been a loss in value of an equity investment, the company evaluates the investment for impairment by estimating the company’s ability to recover its investment or if the loss in value is other than temporary. To evaluate whether an impairment is other than temporary, the company considers relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the period of time in any unrealized loss position, the likelihood of a future recovery, and the company’s positive intent and ability to hold the investment until the forecasted recovery. If the company determines the loss in value is other than temporary, the company recognizes an impairment charge to reflect the investment at fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third party appraisals. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, the parent company generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the United States if it meets minimum distribution requirements, and certain income, asset and share ownership tests. However, some of the company’s subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on the company’s taxable income arising from its taxable real estate investment trust subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as depreciation and gain recognition. The company is required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if it is determined, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The company concluded, based on a review of the relative weight of the available evidence, that it was more likely than not that it would not generate sufficient future taxable income to realize certain deferred tax assets. Foreign Currency Remeasurement and Translation. Transactions that require the remeasurement and translation of a foreign currency are recorded according to accounting guidance on foreign currency translation. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the company’s subsidiaries formed in the United States, Mexico and certain subsidiaries in Europe. Other than Mexico and certain subsidiaries in Europe, the functional currency for the company’s subsidiaries operating outside the United States is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity or property is located, mitigating the effect of currency exchange gains and losses. The company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. 57 Table of Contents Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. The company translates income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The company’s international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. In these instances, non-monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. The company also records gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. The same store pool includes all properties that are owned as of the end of both the current and prior year reporting periods and excludes development properties stabilized after December 31, 2007 (generally defined as properties that are 90% occupied). As of December 31, 2009, the same store industrial pool consisted of properties aggregating approximately 63.8 million square feet. The company’s future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition and disposition of additional properties, and expenses may vary materially from historical results. Acquisition and development property divestiture activity for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Acquired: Square feet (in thousands) — 2,831 702 Acquisition cost (in thousands) $ — $ 217,044 $ 62,241 Development Properties Sold or Contributed: Square feet (in thousands) 3,387 5,274 8,600 For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 (dollars in millions): For the Years Ended December 31, Revenues 2009 2008 $ Change % Change Rental revenues Same store $ 473.8 $ 533.5 $ (59.7 ) (11.2 )% 2008 acquisitions 19.5 11.0 8.5 77.3 % Development 50.9 21.8 29.1 133.5 % Other industrial 51.8 58.8 (7.0 ) (11.9 )% Total rental revenues 596.0 625.1 (29.1 ) (4.7 )% Private capital revenues 37.9 68.5 (30.6 ) (44.7 )% Total revenues $ 633.9 $ 693.6 $ (59.7 ) (8.6 )% Same store rental revenues decreased $59.7 million from the prior year due primarily to the contribution of AMB Partners II, L.P. (previously, a consolidated co-investment venture) to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an unconsolidated co-investment venture, on July 1, 2008. Same store rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 would have been $494.6 million if the interests in AMB Partners II, L.P. had been contributed as of January 1, 2008, rather than July 1, 2008. The decrease of $20.8 million, excluding the effect of the contribution of interests in AMB Partners II, L.P., was primarily due to decreased occupancy during 2009. The increase in revenues from prior year acquisitions is due to revenues recognized for the full year ended December 31, 2009 for properties acquired throughout all of 2008. The increase in rental revenues from development of $29.1 million is 58 Table of Contents primarily due to increased occupancy at several of the company’s development projects. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from development projects that have reached certain levels of operation but are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. The decrease in these revenues of $7.0 million primarily reflects a decline in occupancy in 2009. The decrease in private capital revenues of $30.6 million was primarily due to a decrease in incentive and acquisition fees recognized in 2009 from fees recognized in the prior year. In 2009, the company recognized incentive distributions of $2.9 million for AMB DFS Fund I, LLC, and in 2008, the company received incentive distributions of $33.0 million for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. and $1.0 million in connection with the sale of the partnership interests in AMB/Erie, L.P., including its final real estate asset to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. For the Years Ended December 31, Costs and Expenses 2009 2008 $ Change % Change Property operating costs: Rental expenses $ 109.9 $ 100.5 $ 9.4 9.4 % Real estate taxes 79.1 78.9 0.2 0.3 % Total property operating costs $ 189.0 $ 179.4 $ 9.6 5.4 % Property operating costs Same store $ 143.6 $ 149.6 $ (6.0 ) (4.0 )% 2008 acquisitions 7.8 3.1 4.7 151.6 % Development 21.3 7.7 13.6 176.6 % Other industrial 16.3 19.0 (2.7 ) (14.2 )% Total property operating costs 189.0 179.4 9.6 5.4 % Depreciation and amortization 179.9 164.2 15.7 9.6 % General and administrative 115.3 144.0 (28.7 ) (19.9 )% Restructuring charges 6.4 12.3 (5.9 ) (48.0 )% Fund costs 1.1 1.1 — — % Real estate impairment losses 174.4 183.7 (9.3 ) (5.1 )% Other expenses 10.2 0.5 9.7 1,940.0 % Total costs and expenses $ 676.3 $ 685.2 $ (8.9 ) (1.3 )% Same store properties’ operating expenses decreased $6.0 million from the prior year primarily due to the contribution of AMB Partners II, L.P. (previously, a consolidated co-investment venture) to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an unconsolidated co-investment venture, on July 1, 2008. Same store operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 would have been $139.7 million if the interests in AMB Partners II, L.P. had been contributed as of January 1, 2008, rather than July 1, 2008. The increase of $3.9 million, excluding the effect of the contribution of interests in AMB Partners II, L.P., was primarily due to an increase in common area maintenance expenses and ground rent expense. The increase in expenses of $4.7 million related to properties acquired in 2008 is due to the recognition of expenses for the full year ended December 31, 2009 for properties acquired throughout all of 2008. The increase in development operating costs of $13.6 million was primarily due to an increase in utilities, repairs and maintenance expenses and ground rent expenses due to higher occupancy in certain development projects. The decrease in other industrial operating costs of $2.7 million was primarily due to the disposition of industrial operating properties during 2009. The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses of $15.7 million is primarily due to $15.5 million additional depreciation expense recorded upon reclassification of assets from properties held for contribution to investments in real estate in 2009 and asset stabilizations, partially offset by the full depreciation expense taken on an asset demolition in the third quarter of 2008. The decrease in general and administrative expenses of $28.7 million is primarily due to a personnel and cost reduction plan implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the company recorded $6.4 million in restructuring charges, as compared to $12.3 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008, due to the further implementation of the cost reduction plan, which included a reduction in global headcount, office closure costs and 59 Table of Contents the termination of certain contractual obligations. See Item 15: Note 3 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a more detailed discussion of the real estate impairment losses recorded in the company’s results of operations during 2009 and 2008. Other expenses increased $9.7 million primarily as a result of an increase in the company’s non-qualified deferred compensation plan expenses of $15.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in dead deal costs of $5.8 million from prior year.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the company did not contribute any industrial operating properties to unconsolidated co-investment ventures. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the company contributed one industrial operating property for approximately $66.2 million, aggregating approximately 0.8 million square feet, into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. As a result, the company recognized a gain of $20.0 million on the contribution, representing the portion of the company’s interest in the contributed property acquired by the third-party investors for cash. The decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures of $5.8 million for 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to lower occupancy in 2009 and impairment losses recognized on the company’s unconsolidated assets under management, partially offset by the contribution of AMB Partners II, L.P. (previously, a consolidated co-investment venture) to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an unconsolidated co-investment venture, on July 1, 2008. Other income increased $9.4 million from the prior year primarily due to a $15.7 million increase in gains related to the company’s non-qualified deferred compensation plan, partially offset by a decrease in bank interest income of $4.7 million due to lower cash balances and interest rates and an increase in foreign currency exchange rate losses. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the company recognized a loss on currency remeasurement of approximately $7.2 million, compared to a loss of approximately $5.7 million in the same period of 2008. Interest expense decreased $12.6 million primarily due to decreased borrowings as well as a decrease in interest rates. Loss on early extinguishment of debt increased by $11.5 million primarily due to early repayments of secured debt and the completion of the repurchase of bonds in connection with the company’s tender offers in 2009.

During the year ended December 31, 60 Table of Contents 2009, the company sold value-added conversion development projects and land parcels aggregating approximately 0.2 million square for a sale price of $143.9 million, with a resulting net gain of $53.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the company sold industrial operating properties aggregating approximately 2.3 million square feet for a sale price of $151.6 million, with a resulting gain of $37.2 million. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2009, the company recognized a deferred gain of $1.6 million on the sale of industrial operating properties, aggregating approximately 0.1 million square feet, for a price of $17.5 million, which was deferred as part of the contribution of AMB Partners II, L.P. to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. in July 2008.

(previously, a consolidated co-investment venture) to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an unconsolidated co-investment venture, on July 1, 2008. Same store rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 would have been $573.3 million if the interests in AMB Partners II, L.P. had not been contributed as of December 31, 2008. The increase of $18.3 million, excluding the effect of the contribution of interests in AMB Partners II, L.P., was primarily due to increased rental rates and decreases in free rent. The increase in rental revenues from development of $14.5 million is primarily due to increased occupancy at several of the company’s development projects. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from development projects that have reached certain levels of operation but are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. The increase in these revenues of $1.9 million primarily reflects the number of projects that have reached these levels of operation and higher rent levels during 2008. The increase in private capital revenues of $36.8 million was primarily due to the receipt of an incentive distribution of $33.0 million for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an 61 Table of Contents incentive distribution of $1.0 million in connection with the sale of the partnership interests in AMB/Erie, L.P., including its final real estate asset to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and an increase in asset management fees as a result of an increase in total unconsolidated assets under management, partially offset by a decrease in acquisition fees.

(previously, a consolidated co-investment venture) to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an unconsolidated co-investment venture, on July 1, 2008. Same store operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 would have been $159.9 million if the interests in AMB Partners II, L.P. had not been contributed as of December 31, 2008. The increase of $4.6 million, excluding the effect of the contribution of interests in AMB Partners II, L.P., was primarily due to increased real estate taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance expenses, ground rent expenses and non-reimbursable expenses. The increase in development operating costs of $4.8 million was primarily due to an increase in real estate taxes as well as increased utilities, repairs and maintenance expenses and ground rent expenses due to higher occupancy in certain development projects. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to unconsolidated co-investment ventures, which are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation but are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. The increase in other industrial operating costs of $8.1 million was primarily due to an increase in the number of properties that have reached these levels of operations. The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses of $6.9 million was primarily due to the recognition of $4.3 million of depreciation expense resulting from the reclassification of $76.7 million from properties held for contribution to investments in real estate in 2008 and asset stabilizations, as well as the full depreciation expense taken on an asset demolition in the third quarter of 2008. The increase in general and administrative expenses of $14.5 million was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs, resulting from increased employee headcount in the first three quarters of 2008 as well as an increase in professional services, and taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the company recorded $12.3 million in restructuring charges due to the implementation of a broad-based cost reduction plan, which included a reduction in global headcount, office closure costs and the termination of certain contractual obligations. The increase in real estate impairment losses was primarily a result of changes in the economic environment in addition to the write-off of pursuit costs. See Item 15: Note 3 of the “Notes to 62 Table of Contents Consolidated Financial Statements” for a more detailed discussion of the real estate impairment losses recorded in the company’s results of operations during the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in other expenses of $4.6 million was primarily due to a loss on our non-qualified deferred compensation plans during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to a gain during the year ended December 31, 2007.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the company contributed one industrial operating property for approximately $66.2 million, aggregating approximately 0.8 million square feet, into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. As a result, the company recognized a gain of $20.0 million on the contribution, representing the portion of its interest in the contributed property acquired by the third-party investors for cash. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the company contributed 4.2 million square feet in industrial operating properties into AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, contributed one 0.2 million square foot industrial operating property into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and contributed one industrial operating property aggregating approximately 0.1 million square feet into AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, for a total of approximately $524.9 million. As a result of these contributions, the company recognized gains from the contribution of real estate interests of approximately $73.4 million, representing the portion of its interest in the contributed properties acquired by the third-party investors for cash. The increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures of $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 was primarily due to the contribution of the interests in AMB Partners II, L.P. (previously, a consolidated co-investment venture) to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an unconsolidated co-investment venture, as well as growth in the company’s unconsolidated assets under management. Other income (expenses) decreased $25.4 million from the prior year primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate loss, a loss on the company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plan of $7.8 million, the recognition of a $5.5 million loss on impairment of an investment and a decrease in interest income of approximately $3.3 million, partially offset by an increase in third party management fees. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the company recognized a gain on currency remeasurement of approximately $3.9 million, compared to a loss of approximately $5.7 million in 2008. Additionally, other income during the year ended December 31, 2007 included insurance proceeds of approximately $2.9 million related to losses from Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma. Interest expense increased $7.2 million as a result of increased total consolidated debt at December 31, 2008.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the company sold approximately 0.1 million square feet of industrial operating properties for a sale price of $3.6 million, with a resulting gain of $1.0 million, and the company recognized a deferred gain of approximately $1.4 million on the sale of industrial operating properties, aggregating approximately 0.1 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $3.5 million, which were disposed of on December 31, 2007. No value-added conversion projects were sold during 2008.

As a result of the redemptions and repurchase, the company recognized a reduction of income available to common stockholders of $2.9 million for the original issuance costs during the year ended December 31, 2007. No repurchases of units were made during the year ended December 31, 2008. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE PARENT COMPANY In this “Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Parent Company” section, the “parent company” refers only to AMB Property Corporation and not to any of its subsidiaries. The parent company’s business is operated primarily through the operating partnership. The parent company issues public equity from time to time, but does not otherwise conduct any business or generate any capital itself. The parent company itself does not hold any indebtedness, and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the operating partnership. The parent company’s principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common and preferred stock. The parent company’s principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the operating partnership. As of December 31, 2009, the parent company owned an approximate 97.8% general partnership interest in the operating partnership, excluding preferred units. The remaining approximate 2.2% common limited partnership interests are owned by non-affiliated investors and certain current and former directors and officers of the parent company. As of December 31, 2009, the parent company owned all of the preferred limited partnership units of the operating partnership. As the sole general partner of the operating partnership, the parent company has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for the operating partnership’s day-to-day management and control. The parent company causes the operating partnership to distribute all, or such portion as the parent company may in its discretion determine, of its available cash in the manner provided in the operating partnership’s partnership agreement. Generally, if distributions are made, distributions are paid in the following order of priority: first, to satisfy any prior distribution shortfall to the parent company as the holder of preferred units; second, to the parent company as the holder of preferred units; and third, to the holders of common units of the operating partnership, including the parent company, in accordance with the rights of each such class. As general partner with control of the operating partnership, the parent company consolidates the operating partnership for financial reporting purposes, and the parent company does not have significant assets other than its 64 Table of Contents investment in the operating partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the parent company and the operating partnership are the same on their respective financial statements. However, all debt is held directly or indirectly at the operating partnership level, and the parent company has guaranteed some of the operating partnership’s secured and unsecured debt as discussed below. As the parent company consolidates the operating partnership, the section entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership” should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the company on a consolidated basis and how the company is operated as a whole. Capital Resources of the Parent Company Distributions from the operating partnership are the parent company’s principal source of capital. The parent company receives proceeds from equity issuances from time to time, but is required by the operating partnership’s partnership agreement to contribute the proceeds from its equity issuances to the operating partnership in exchange for partnership units of the operating partnership. As circumstances warrant, the parent company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. The operating partnership may use the proceeds to repay debt, including borrowings under its lines of credit, to make acquisitions of properties, portfolios of properties or U.S. or foreign property-owning or real estate-related entities, to invest in existing or newly created co-investment ventures or for general corporate purposes. Common and Preferred Equity The parent company has authorized for issuance 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which the following series were designated as of December 31, 2009: 2,300,000 shares of series L cumulative redeemable preferred stock, of which 2,000,000 are outstanding; 2,300,000 shares of series M cumulative redeemable preferred stock, all of which are outstanding; 3,000,000 shares of series O cumulative redeemable preferred stock, all of which are outstanding; and 2,000,000 shares of series P cumulative redeemable preferred stock, all of which are outstanding. On November 10, 2009, the parent company purchased all 1,595,337 outstanding series D preferred units of AMB Property II, L.P. in exchange for 2,880,281 shares of its common stock at a discount of $9.8 million and contributed the series D preferred units to the operating partnership. The operating partnership issued 2,880,281 general partnership units to the parent company in exchange for the 1,595,337 series D preferred units the parent company purchased. In December 2007, the parent company’s board of directors approved a two-year common stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of the parent company’s common stock, which terminated on December 31, 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the parent company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the parent company repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate price of $87.7 million at a weighted average price of $49.64 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the parent company repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate price of $53.4 million at a weighted average price of $49.87 per share. In March 2009, the parent company completed the issuance of 47.4 million shares of its common stock at a price of $12.15 per share for proceeds of approximately $552.3 million, net of discounts, commissions and estimated transaction expenses of approximately $23.8 million. The proceeds from the offering were contributed to the operating partnership in exchange for the issuance of 47.4 million general partnership units to the parent company. 65 Table of Contents Market Equity as of December 31, 2009 Shares/Units Market Market Security Outstanding Price(1) Value(2) Common stock 149,258,376 (5) $ 25.55 $ 3,813,552 Common limited partnership units(3) 3,376,141 $ 25.55 86,260 Total 152,634,517 $ 3,899,812 Total options outstanding 8,107,697 Dilutive effect of stock options(4) — (1) Dollars, per share/unit (2) Dollars, in thousands (3) Includes class B common limited partnership units issued by AMB Property II, L.P.

Such joint ventures held approximately 21.0 million square feet as of December 31, 2009, and are consolidated for financial reporting purposes. Please see “Explanatory Note” on page 1 and Part IV, Item 15: Note 11 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a discussion of the noncontrolling interests of the parent company. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, the parent company presently intends over the long term to operate with a parent company’s share of total debt-to-parent company’s share of total market capitalization ratio or parent company’s share of total debt-to-parent company’s share of total assets of approximately 45% or less. In order to operate at this targeted ratio over the long term, the parent company is currently exploring various options to monetize its development assets through possible contribution to funds where capacity is available, the formation of joint ventures and the sale to third parties. It is also exploring the potential sale of industrial operating assets to further enhance liquidity. As of December 31, 2009, the parent company’s share of total debt-to-parent company’s share of total assets ratio was 43.6%. (See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for the definitions of “parent company’s share of total market capitalization,” “market equity,” “parent company’s share of total debt” and “parent company’s share of total assets.”) The parent company typically finances its co-investment ventures with secured debt at a loan-to-value ratio of 50-65% pursuant to its co-investment venture agreements. Additionally, the operating partnership currently intends to manage its capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on its senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, the parent company’s and operating partnership’s organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that either entity may incur. Accordingly, management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder or unitholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render the parent company or the operating partnership unable to comply with these policies. For example, decreases in the market 66 Table of Contents price of the parent company’s common stock have caused an increase in the ratio of parent company’s share of total debt-to-parent company’s share of total market capitalization. Capitalization Ratios as of December 31, 2009 Parent company’s share of total debt-to-parent company’s share of total market capitalization(1) 46.4% Parent company’s share of total debt plus preferred-to-parent company’s share of total market capitalization(1) 49.4% Parent company’s share of total debt-to-parent company’s share of total assets(1) 43.6% Parent company’s share of total debt plus preferred-to-parent company’s share of total assets(1) 46.4% Parent company’s share of total debt-to-parent company’s share of total book capitalization(1) 47.7% (1) Although the parent company does not hold any indebtedness itself, the parent company’s total debt reflects the consolidation of the operating partnership’s total debt for financial reporting purposes. The parent company’s definition of “total market capitalization” for the parent company is total debt plus preferred equity liquidation preferences plus market equity. The definition of “parent company’s share of total market capitalization” is the parent company’s share of total debt plus preferred equity liquidation preferences plus market equity. The definition of “market equity” is the total number of outstanding shares of common stock of the parent company and common limited partnership units of the operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. multiplied by the closing price per share of the parent company’s common stock as of December 31, 2009. The definition of “preferred” is preferred equity liquidation preferences. “Parent company’s share of total book capitalization” is defined as the parent company’s share of total debt plus noncontrolling interests to preferred unitholders and limited partnership unitholders plus stockholders’ equity. “Parent company’s share of total debt” is the parent company’s pro rata portion of the total debt based on the parent company’s percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures holding the debt. “Parent company’s share of total assets” is the parent company’s pro rata portion of the gross book value of real estate interests plus cash and other assets. The parent company believes that share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze the parent company’s leverage and to compare the parent company’s leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of the parent company’s debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Parent company’s share of total debt is not intended to reflect the parent company’s actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. For a reconciliation of parent company’s share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure, please see the table of debt maturities and capitalization in the section below entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources of AMB Property, L.P.” Liquidity of the Parent Company The liquidity of the parent company is dependent on the operating partnership’s ability to make sufficient distributions to the parent company. The primary cash requirement of the parent company is its payment of dividends to its stockholders. The parent company also guarantees some of the operating partnership’s secured and unsecured debt described in the “Debt Guarantees” section below. If the operating partnership fails to fulfill its debt requirements, which trigger parent guarantee obligations, then the parent company will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees. The parent company believes the operating partnership’s sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and borrowings available under its unsecured credit facilities, are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to the parent company and, in turn, for the parent company to make its dividend payments to its stockholders. However, there can be no assurance that the operating partnership’s sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs, including its ability to make distribution payments to the parent company. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect the operating partnership’s ability to pay its distributions to the parent company, which will, in turn, adversely affect the parent company’s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and the market price of the parent company’s stock. Should the parent company face a situation in which the operating partnership does not have sufficient cash available through its operations to continue operating its business as usual (including making its distributions to the parent company), the operating partnership may need to find alternative ways to increase the operating partnership’s 67 Table of Contents liquidity. Such alternatives, which would be done through the operating partnership, may include, without limitation, divesting itself of properties and decreasing the operating partnership’s cash distribution to the parent company. Other alternatives are for the parent company to pay some or all of its dividends in stock rather than cash or issuing its equity in public or private transactions whether or not at favorable pricing or on favorable terms. If the operating partnership is unable to obtain new financing or refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then its cash flow may be insufficient to pay its distributions to the parent company, which will have, as a result, insufficient funds to pay cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the operating partnership’s interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense of the operating partnership would adversely affect the parent company’s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and the market price of its stock. The operating partnership may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for the parent company’s equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, the parent company’s liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. For the parent company to maintain its qualification as a real estate investment trust, it must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its taxable income. While historically the parent company has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its stockholders, it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, the parent company’s own stock. As a result of this distribution requirement, the operating partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its on-going operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not real estate investment trusts can. The parent company may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the operating partnership’s working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. As circumstances warrant, the parent company may issue equity securities from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. The parent company would contribute any such proceeds to the operating partnership, which would then use the proceeds to repay debt, including borrowings under its lines of credit, to make acquisitions of properties, portfolios of properties or U.S. or foreign property-owning or real estate-related entities or for general corporate purposes. Dividends. The following table sets forth the parent company’s dividends paid or payable per share for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: For the Years Ended December 31, Paying Entity Security 2009 2008 2007 AMB Property Corporation Common stock $ 1.12 $ 1.56 $ 2.00 AMB Property Corporation Series L preferred stock $ 1.63 $ 1.63 $ 1.63 AMB Property Corporation Series M preferred stock $ 1.69 $ 1.69 $ 1.69 AMB Property Corporation Series O preferred stock $ 1.75 $ 1.75 $ 1.75 AMB Property Corporation Series P preferred stock $ 1.71 $ 1.71 $ 1.71 The parent company anticipates that the operating partnership will be required to use proceeds from debt and equity financings (including the issuance of equity by the parent company) and the divestiture of properties, in addition to cash from its operations, to make its distribution payments and repay its maturing debt as it comes due. However, the parent company and the operating partnership may not be able to issue such securities on favorable terms or at all. The parent company’s or the operating partnership’s inability to issue securities on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect the operating partnership’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flow and its ability to pay distributions to the parent company, which will, in turn, adversely affect the market price of the parent company’s stock and the parent company’s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders. 68 Table of Contents Cash flows generated by the operating partnership were sufficient to cover the operating partnership’s distributions for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, including its distributions to the parent company, which were, in turn, paid to the parent company’s stockholders as dividends. Cash flows from the operating partnership’s real estate operations and private capital businesses, which are included in “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the parent company’s Cash Flows from Operating Activities and cash flows from the operating partnership’s real estate development and operations businesses which are included in “Net proceeds from divestiture of real estate” in the parent company’s Cash Flows from Investing Activities in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, were sufficient to pay dividends on the parent company’s common stock and preferred stock, distributions on common and preferred limited partnership units of the operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. and distributions to noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Cash Flows from Operating Activities alone were not sufficient to pay such dividends and distributions, as shown in the table below. The parent company uses proceeds from the operating partnership included in Cash Flows from Investing Activities (specifically, the proceeds from sales and contributions of properties as part of its real estate development and operations businesses) to fund dividends and distributions not covered by Cash Flows from Operating Activities, if any. The following table sets forth the summary of the parent company’s dividends and the operating partnership’s distributions paid or payable for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: For the Years Ended December 31, Summary of Dividends and Distributions Paid 2009 2008 2007 (dollars in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 242,276 $ 301,020 $ 240,543 Dividends paid to common and preferred stockholders(1) (137,108 ) (220,476 ) (211,744 ) Distributions to noncontrolling interests, including preferred units (21,178 ) (66,007 ) (137,722 ) Excess of net cash provided by operating activities over dividends and distributions paid $ 83,990 $ 14,537 $ (108,923 ) Net proceeds from divestiture of real estate $ 482,515 $ 421,647 $ 824,628 Excess (deficit) of net cash provided by operating activities and net proceeds from divestiture of real estate over dividends and distributions paid $ 566,505 $ 436,184 $ 715,705 (1) Partnership unit distributions paid to the parent company by the operating partnership are, in turn, paid by the parent company as dividends to its stockholders. Debt guarantees. The parent company is the guarantor of the operating partnership’s obligations with respect to its unsecured senior debt securities. As of December 31, 2009, the operating partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $1.2 billion in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.4% and had an average term of 6.1 years. In May 2008, the operating partnership sold $325.0 million aggregate principal amount of its senior unsecured notes under its Series C medium-term note program. The indenture for the senior debt securities contains limitation on mergers or consolidations of the parent company. The parent company guarantees the operating partnership’s obligations with respect to $425.0 million of its other debt, related to the following loan facility. In October 2009, the operating partnership refinanced its $325.0 million senior unsecured term loan facility, which was set to mature in September 2010, with a $345.0 million multi-currency facility, maturing October 2012. In December 2009, the operating partnership exercised its option and increased the facility to $425.0 million, in accordance with the terms set forth in the credit facility. The facility includes Euro and Yen tranches, with both the multi-currency and the U.S. dollar components currently priced at 275 basis points over the applicable LIBOR index. This facility contains limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations of the parent company. The parent company is a guarantor of the operating partnership’s obligations under its $550.0 million (includes Euros, Yen, British pounds sterling or U.S. dollar denominated borrowings) unsecured revolving credit facility, 69 Table of Contents which, as of December 31, 2009, had a balance of $55.5 million using the exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2009 and bore a weighted average interest rate of 0.68%. The parent company, along with the operating partnership, guarantees the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, under its credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the credit agreement. This credit facility has an initial borrowing limit of 55.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2009, equaled approximately $591.3 million U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2009, this facility had a balance of $182.9 million using the exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2009 and bore a weighted average interest rate of 0.7%. The parent company and the operating partnership guarantee the obligations for such subsidiaries and other entities controlled by the operating partnership that are selected by the operating partnership from time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant to a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The operating partnership and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, each acting as a borrower, with the parent company and the operating partnership as guarantors, entered into this credit facility, which has an option to further increase the facility to $750.0 million, to extend the maturity date to July 2011 and to allow for future borrowing in Indian rupees. As of December 31, 2009, this facility had a balance of $239.2 million using the exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2009 and bore a weighted average interest rate of 0.89%. The credit agreements related to the above facilities contain limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations of the parent company. Potential Contingent and Unknown Liabilities. Contingent and unknown liabilities may include claims for indemnification by officers and directors and tax, legal and regulatory liabilities. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, the operating partnership uses unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, common and preferred equity (issued by the parent company, the operating partnership and their subsidiaries, as applicable) to capitalize its wholly owned assets. Over time, the operating partnership plans to retire non-recourse, secured debt encumbering its wholly owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes where practicable. In managing the co-investment ventures, in general, the operating partnership uses non-recourse, secured debt to capitalize its co-investment ventures. The operating partnership currently expects that its principal sources of working capital and funding for debt service, development, acquisitions, expansion and renovation of properties will include: • cash on hand and cash flow from operations; • borrowings under its unsecured credit facilities; • other forms of secured or unsecured financing; • assumption of debt related to acquired properties; • proceeds from limited partnership unit offerings (including issuances of limited partnership units by the operating partnership’s subsidiaries); • proceeds from debt securities offerings by the operating partnership; • proceeds from equity offerings by the parent company; • net proceeds from divestitures of properties; • private capital from co-investment partners; • net proceeds from contributions of properties and completed development projects to its co-investment ventures; and 70 Table of Contents • net proceeds from the sales of development projects, value-added conversion projects and land to third parties. The operating partnership currently expects that its principal funding requirements will include: • debt service; • distributions on outstanding common, preferred and general partnership units; • working capital; • acquisitions of properties, portfolios of properties, interests in real-estate related entities or platforms; and • development, expansion and renovation of properties. Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership The operating partnership believes its sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and borrowings available under its unsecured credit facilities, are adequate for it to meet its current liquidity requirements. However, there can be no assurance that the operating partnership’s sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect the operating partnership’s financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and the ability to pay cash distributions to its unitholders and make payments to its noteholders. For the parent company to maintain its qualification as a real estate investment trust, it must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its taxable income. As a result of this distribution requirement, the operating partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its on-going operations to the same extent that other corporations whose parent companies are not real estate investment trusts can. The operating partnership may need to continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund its working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. Cash Flows. For the year ended December 31, 2009, cash provided by operating activities was $242.3 million as compared to $301.0 million for the same period in 2008. This change is primarily due to lower net operating income in 2009 as well as changes in the operating partnership’s accounts receivable and other assets and accounts payable and other liabilities. Cash provided by investing activities was $75.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to cash used in investing activities of $881.8 million for the same period in 2008. This change is primarily due to an increase in net proceeds from divestiture of real estate and securities and decreases in the following: cash paid for property acquisitions, additions to land, buildings, development costs, building improvements and lease costs, loans made to affiliated entities and the purchase of equity interests. This is partially offset by the decrease in repayment of mortgage and loan receivables. Cash used in financing activities was $288.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to cash provided by financing activities of $581.8 million for the same period in 2008. This change is due primarily to a decrease in net borrowings on secured debt, other debt and unsecured credit facilities and an increase in payments on senior debt. This activity was partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from issuances of senior debt, an increase in the issuance of common and preferred units, a decrease in the repurchase of common units, and a decrease in distributions paid to common and preferred unitholders and noncontrolling interests. Partners’ Capital. As of December 31, 2009, the operating partnership had outstanding 149,028,965 common general partnership units; 2,119,928 common limited partnership units; 2,000,000 6.50% series L cumulative redeemable preferred units; 2,300,000 6.75% series M cumulative redeemable preferred units; 3,000,000 7.00% series O cumulative redeemable preferred units; and 2,000,000 6.85% series P cumulative redeemable preferred units. On November 10, 2009, the parent company purchased all 1,595,337 outstanding series D preferred units of AMB Property II, L.P. in exchange for 2,880,281 shares of its common stock at a discount of $9.8 million and contributed the series D preferred units to the operating partnership. The operating partnership issued 2,880,281 general partnership units to the parent company in exchange for the 1,595,337 series D preferred units the parent company purchased. 71 Table of Contents The net proceeds from the parent company’s March 2009 offering of 47.4 million shares of common stock were contributed to the operating partnership in exchange for the issuance of 47.4 million general partnership units to the parent company. The operating partnership used the proceeds from the offering to reduce borrowings under its unsecured credit facilities. The proceeds were approximately $552.3 million, net of discounts, commissions and estimated transaction expenses of approximately $23.8 million. Development Completions. Development completions are generally defined as properties that are 90% occupied or pre-leased, or that have been substantially complete for at least 12 months.

(2) The planned capitalization and investment capacity of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. and AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, as open-ended funds is not limited. The planned capitalization represents the gross book value of real estate assets as of the most recent quarter end. (3) The investment period for AMB DFS Fund I, LLC ended in June 2009, and the planned capitalization of this fund as of December 31, 2009 was the gross book value as of December 31, 2009 plus the estimated investment of $5.1 million to complete the existing development assets held by the fund. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the operating partnership also had a 100% consolidated interest in G. Accion, a Mexican real estate company, which has been renamed AMB Property Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (“AMB 75 Table of Contents Property Mexico”). AMB Property Mexico owns and develops real estate and provides real estate management and development services in Mexico. On June 13, 2008, the operating partnership acquired approximately 19% of additional equity interest and on July 18, 2008, it acquired the remaining equity interest (approximately 42%) in AMB Property Mexico, increasing its equity interest from approximately 39% to 100%. Through its investment in AMB Property Mexico, the operating partnership held equity interests in various other unconsolidated ventures totaling approximately $18.7 million and $24.6 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Please see Part IV, Item 15: Note 13 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a discussion of the operating partnership’s significant unconsolidated co-investment ventures. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, the operating partnership presently intends over the long term to operate with an operating partnership’s share of total debt-to-operating partnership’s share of total market capitalization ratio or operating partnership’s share of total debt-to-operating partnership’s share of total assets of approximately 45% or less. In order to operate at this targeted ratio over the long term, the operating partnership is currently exploring various options to monetize its development assets through possible contribution to funds where capacity is available, the formation of joint ventures and the sale to third parties. The operating partnership is also exploring the potential sale of operating assets to further enhance liquidity. As of December 31, 2009, the operating partnership’s share of total debt-to-operating partnership’s share of total assets ratio was 43.6%. (See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for the definitions of “operating partnership’s share of total market capitalization,” “market equity,” “operating partnership’s share of total debt” and “operating partnership’s share of total assets.”) The operating partnership typically finances its co-investment ventures with secured debt at a loan-to-value ratio of 50-65% per its co-investment venture agreements. Additionally, the operating partnership currently intends to manage its capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on its senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, the operating partnership’s organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that it may incur. Accordingly, management could alter or eliminate these policies without unitholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render it unable to comply with these policies. For example, decreases in the market price of the parent company’s common stock have caused an increase in the ratio of operating partnership’s share of total debt-to-operating partnership’s share of total market capitalization. As of December 31, 2009, the aggregate principal amount of the operating partnership’s secured debt was $1.1 billion, excluding insignificant unamortized net premiums. Of the $1.1 billion of secured debt, $771.3 million, excluding unamortized discounts, is secured by properties in the operating partnership’s joint ventures. Such secured debt is generally non-recourse and, as of December 31, 2009, bore interest at rates varying from 0.7% to 9.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 4.5%) and had final maturity dates ranging from February 2010 to November 2022. As of December 31, 2009, $622.4 million of the secured debt obligations bore interest at fixed rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 6.4%), while the remaining $474.1 million bore interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 2.0%). As of December 31, 2009, $610.5 million of the secured debt was held by co-investment ventures. On September 4, 2008, the operating partnership entered into a $230.0 million secured term loan credit agreement set to mature on September 4, 2010. In December 2009, the operating partnership paid off the entire balance under this facility. As of December 31, 2009, the operating partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $1.2 billion in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.4% and had an average term of 6.1 years. The unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various covenants. The covenants contain affirmative covenants, including compliance with financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. As of December 31, 2009, the operating partnership had $482.9 million outstanding in other debt which bore a weighted average interest rate of 4.1% and had an average term of 2.8 years. Other debt also includes a $70.0 million credit facility obtained on August 24, 2007 by AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, which had a $50.0 million balance outstanding as of December 31, 2009. Of the remaining $432.9 million outstanding in other debt, $425.0 million is related to the loan facility described below. 76 Table of Contents In October 2009, the operating partnership refinanced its $325.0 million unsecured term loan facility, which was set to mature in September 2010, with a $345.0 million multi-currency facility, maturing October 2012. In December 2009, the operating partnership exercised its option and increased the facility to $425.0 million, in accordance with the terms set forth in the credit facility. As of December 31, 2009, the facility had an outstanding balance of $417.7 million, using the exchange rates in effect at December 31, 2009. The parent company guarantees the operating partnership’s obligations with respect to certain of its unsecured debt. These covenants contain affirmative covenants, including compliance with financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. The operating partnership was in compliance with its financial covenants under its unsecured credit facilities at December 31, 2009. If the operating partnership is unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then its cash flow may be insufficient to pay cash distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay cash distributions to its unitholders and make payments to its noteholders. The operating partnership may from time to time, seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, its liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. If the long-term debt ratings of the operating partnership fall below current levels, the borrowing cost of debt under the operating partnership’s unsecured credit facilities and certain term loans will increase. In addition, if the long-term debt ratings of the operating partnership fall below investment grade, the operating partnership may be unable to request borrowings in currencies other than U.S. dollars or Japanese Yen, as applicable. However, the lack of other currency borrowings does not affect the operating partnership’s ability to fully draw down under the credit facilities or term loans. However, the operating partnership’s lenders will not be able to terminate its credit facilities or certain term loans in the event that its credit rating falls below investment grade status. None of the operating partnership’s credit facilities contain covenants regarding the parent company’s stock price or market capitalization, thus a decrease in the parent company’s stock price is not expected to impact the operating partnership’s ability to borrow under its existing lines of credit. While the operating partnership currently does not expect its long-term debt ratings to fall below investment grade, in the event that the ratings do fall below those levels, it may be unable to exercise its options to extend the term of its credit facilities and the loss of the operating partnership’s ability to borrow in foreign currencies could affect its ability to optimally hedge its borrowings against foreign currency exchange rate changes. In addition, based on publicly available information regarding its lenders, the operating partnership currently does not expect to lose borrowing capacity under its existing lines of credit as a result of a dissolution, bankruptcy, consolidation, merger or other business combination among its lenders. The operating partnership’s access to funds under its credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the lenders that are parties to such facilities to meet their funding commitments to the operating partnership. If the operating partnership does not have sufficient cash flows and income from its operations to meet its financial commitments and lenders are not able to meet their funding commitments to the operating partnership, the operating partnership’s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. The operating partnership’s primary financial covenants with respect to its credit facilities generally relate to fixed charge or debt service coverage, liabilities to asset value, debt to asset value and unencumbered cash flow. As of December 31, 2009, the operating partnership was in compliance with its financial covenants under its credit facilities. There can be no assurance, however, that if the financial markets and economic conditions worsen, the operating partnership will be able to continue to comply with its financial covenants. Certain of the operating partnership’s third party indebtedness is held by its consolidated or unconsolidated joint ventures. In the event that a joint venture partner is unable to meet its obligations under the operating partnership’s joint venture agreements or the third party debt agreements, the operating partnership may elect to pay 77 Table of Contents its joint venture partner’s portion of debt to avoid foreclosure on the mortgaged property or permit the lender to foreclose on the mortgaged property to meet the joint venture’s debt obligations. In either case, the operating partnership would lose income and asset value on the property. In addition, a continued increase in the cost of credit and inability to access the capital and credit markets may adversely impact the occupancy of the operating partnership’s properties, the disposition of its properties, private capital raising and contribution of properties to its co-investment ventures. If it is unable to contribute completed development properties to its co-investment ventures or sell its completed development projects to third parties, the operating partnership will not be able to recognize gains from the contribution or sale of such properties and, as a result, the net income available to its common unitholders and its funds from operations will decrease. Additionally, business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns and other similar factors that affect the operating partnership’s customers may adversely impact its business and financial condition. Furthermore, general uncertainty in the real estate markets has resulted in conditions where the pricing of certain real estate assets may be difficult due to uncertainty with respect to capitalization rates and valuations, among other things, which may add to the difficulty of buyers or the operating partnership’s co-investment ventures to obtain financing on favorable terms to acquire such properties or cause potential buyers to not complete acquisitions of such properties. The market uncertainty with respect to capitalization rates and real estate valuations also adversely impacts the operating partnership’s net asset value. While the operating partnership believes that it has sufficient working capital and capacity under its credit facilities to continue its business operations as usual in the near term, continued turbulence in the global markets and economies and prolonged declines in business and consumer spending may adversely affect its liquidity and financial condition, as well as the liquidity and financial condition of its customers. If these market conditions persist, recur or worsen in the long term, they may limit the operating partnership’s ability, and the ability of its customers, to timely replace maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs. In the event that it does not have sufficient cash available to it through its operations to continue operating its business as usual, the operating partnership may need to find alternative ways to increase its liquidity. Such alternatives may include, without limitation, divesting the operating partnership of properties, whether or not they otherwise meet its strategic objectives to keep in the long term, at less than optimal terms; issuing and selling the operating partnership’s debt and equity in public or private transactions under less than optimal conditions; entering into leases with the operating partnership’s customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms; entering into lease renewals with the operating partnership’s existing customers with a decrease in rental rates at turnover or on suboptimal terms; or paying a portion of the parent company’s dividends in stock rather than cash. There can be no assurance, however, that such alternative ways to increase its liquidity will be available to the operating partnership. Additionally, taking such measures to increase its liquidity may adversely affect the operating partnership’s business, results of operations and financial condition. As circumstances warrant, the operating partnership may issue debt securities from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. The operating partnership would use the proceeds to repay debt, including borrowings under its lines of credit, to make acquisitions of properties, portfolios of properties or U.S. or foreign property-owning or real estate-related entities or platforms, to invest in newly formed or existing joint ventures, or for general corporate purposes. Credit Facilities. The operating partnership has a $550.0 million (includes Euros, Yen, British pounds sterling or U.S. dollar denominated borrowings) unsecured revolving credit facility that matures on June 1, 2010. The parent company is a guarantor of the operating partnership’s obligations under the credit facility. The line carries a one-year extension option, which the operating partnership may exercise at its sole option so long as the operating partnership’s long-term debt rating is investment grade, among other things, and the facility can be increased to up to $700.0 million upon certain conditions. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, which was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2009, based on the operating partnership’s long-term debt rating, with an annual facility fee of 15.0 basis points. If the operating partnership’s long-term debt ratings fall below investment grade, it will be unable to request money market loans and borrowings in Euros, Yen or British pounds sterling. The four-year credit facility includes a multi-currency component, under which up to $550.0 million can be drawn in Euros, Yen, British pounds sterling or U.S. dollars. The operating partnership uses the credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital 78 Table of Contents requirements. As of December 31, 2009, the outstanding balance on this credit facility was $55.5 million and the remaining amount available was $481.7 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $12.8 million, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2009. AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, has a Yen-denominated unsecured revolving credit facility with an initial borrowing limit of 55.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2009, equaled approximately $591.3 million U.S. dollars and bore a weighted average interest rate of 0.70%. The parent company, along with the operating partnership, guarantees the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan, China and South Korea. Generally, borrowers under the credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. The credit facility matures in June 2010 and has a one-year extension option, which the operating partnership may exercise at its sole option so long as the operating partnership’s long-term debt rating is investment grade, among other things. The extension option is also subject to the satisfaction of certain other conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2009, based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s long-term debt. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s long-term debt, and was 15.0 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility as of December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2009, was $182.9 million, and the remaining amount available was $408.4 million. The operating partnership and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, each acting as a borrower, with the parent company and the operating partnership as guarantors, have a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The parent company, along with the operating partnership, guarantees the obligations for such subsidiaries and other entities controlled by the operating partnership that are selected by the operating partnership from time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant to this credit facility. Generally, borrowers under the credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility. The credit facility includes a multi-currency component under which up to $500.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Singapore dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling, and Euros with the ability to add Indian rupees. The line, which matures in July 2011, carries a one-year extension option, which the operating partnership may exercise at its sole option so long as the operating partnership’s long-term debt rating is investment grade, among other things, and can be increased to up to $750.0 million upon certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, which was 60.0 basis points as of December 31, 2009, based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt, with an annual facility fee based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt. If the operating partnership’s long-term debt ratings fall below investment grade, it will be unable to request borrowings in any currency other than U.S. dollars. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2009, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rates in effect at December 31, 2009, was approximately $239.2 million with a weighted average interest rate of 0.89%, and the remaining amount available was $260.8 million. The above credit facilities contain affirmative covenants, including compliance with financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants of the operating partnership, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. The operating partnership was in compliance with its financial covenants under each of these credit agreements as of December 31, 2009. 79 Table of Contents The tables below summarize the operating partnership’s debt maturities, principal payments and capitalization and reconcile operating partnership’s share of total debt to total consolidated debt as of December 31, 2009 (dollars in thousands): Wholly-Owned Consolidated Joint Venture Unsecured Total Unconsolidated Senior Credit Other Secured Secured Other Consolidated Joint Total Debt Facilities(1) Debt Debt Debt Debt Debt Venture Debt Debt 2010 $ 65,000 $ 238,429 $ 2,112 $ 189,562 $ 131,497 $ — $ 626,600 $ 197,198 $ 823,798 2011 69,000 239,201 2,186 88,284 120,355 — 519,026 620,324 1,139,350 2012 — — 426,385 27,764 388,113 50,000 892,262 449,870 1,342,132 2013 293,897 — 920 19,611 49,938 — 364,366 712,750 1,077,116 2014 — — 616 — 5,659 — 6,275 855,551 861,826 2015 112,491 — 664 — 17,610 — 130,765 264,519 395,284 2016 250,000 — — — 16,231 — 266,231 73,102 339,333 2017 — — — — 1,272 — 1,272 351,639 352,911 2018 125,000 — — — 1,455 — 126,455 183,194 309,649 2019 250,000 — — — — — 250,000 — 250,000 Thereafter — — — — 39,154 — 39,154 5,844 44,998 Subtotal $ 1,165,388 $ 477,630 $ 432,883 $ 325,221 $ 771,284 $ 50,000 $ 3,222,406 $ 3,713,991 $ 6,936,397 Unamortized net (discount) premium (9,859 ) — — 273 (224 ) — (9,810 ) (4,513 ) (14,323 ) Subtotal $ 1,155,529 $ 477,630 $ 432,883 $ 325,494 $ 771,060 $ 50,000 $ 3,212,596 $ 3,709,478 $ 6,922,074 Joint venture partners’ share of debt — — — — (433,601 ) (40,000 ) (473,601 ) (2,868,120 ) (3,341,721 ) Operating partnership’s share of total debt(2) $ 1,155,529 $ 477,630 $ 432,883 $ 325,494 $ 337,459 $ 10,000 $ 2,738,995 $ 841,358 $ 3,580,353 Weighted average interest rate 6.4 % 0.8 % 3.9 % 3.5 % 4.9 % 5.8 % 4.6 % 4.8 % 4.7 % Weighted average maturity (years) 6.1 1.0 2.8 1.0 2.7 2.7 3.5 4.1 3.8 (1) Represents three credit facilities with total capacity of approximately $1.6 billion.

(2) Operating partnership’s share of total debt represents the operating partnership’s pro rata portion of the total debt based on the operating partnership’s percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated or unconsolidated joint ventures holding the debt. The operating partnership believes that operating partnership’s share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze its leverage and to compare its leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of the operating partnership’s debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Operating partnership’s share of total debt is not intended to reflect the operating partnership’s actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the co-investment ventures. The above table reconciles operating partnership’s share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure. 80 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2009, the operating partnership had debt maturing in 2010 through 2013, assuming extension options are exercised, as follows (dollars in thousands): After Extension Options(1)(2) 2010 2011 2012 2013 Wholly-owned debt Unsecured Senior Debt $ 65,000 $ 69,000 $ — $ 293,897 Credit Facilities — 238,429 239,201 — Other Debt — — 427,635 1,916 Operating Partnership Secured Debt 188,445 (3) 87,667 28,648 20,466 Subtotal 253,445 395,096 695,484 316,279 Consolidated Joint Ventures AMB-AMS, L.P. 2,559 (4) — — 39,786 AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P. 10,029 (5) 31,022 5,555 93,712 AMB-SGP, L.P. — 42,064 293,700 — Other Industrial Operating Joint Ventures 56,408 42,353 8,506 — Subtotal 68,996 115,439 307,761 133,498 Unconsolidated Joint Ventures AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. 27,157 (6) 184,580 77,660 287,002 AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. 112,004 204,502 179,852 344,432 AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC — 58,825 167,180 — Other Industrial Operating Joint Ventures 9,059 31,995 — 58,771 AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS — — 6,381 5,018 Subtotal 148,220 479,902 431,073 695,223 Total Consolidated 322,441 510,535 1,003,245 449,777 Total Unconsolidated 148,220 479,902 431,073 695,223 Total $ 470,661 $ 990,437 $ 1,434,318 $ 1,145,000 Total Operating Partnership’s Share(7) $ 323,530 $ 558,967 $ 940,365 $ 513,611 (1) Excludes scheduled principal amortization of debt maturing in years subsequent to 2013, as well as debt premiums and discounts.

The definition of “preferred” is preferred equity liquidation preferences. “Operating partnership’s share of total book capitalization” is defined as the operating partnership’s share of total debt plus noncontrolling interests to preferred unitholders and limited partnership 82 Table of Contents unitholders plus stockholders’ equity. “Operating partnership’s share of total debt” is the operating partnership’s pro rata portion of the total debt based on its percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures holding the debt. “Operating partnership’s share of total assets” is the operating partnership’s pro rata portion of the gross book value of real estate interests plus cash and other assets. The operating partnership believes that operating partnership’s share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze its leverage and to compare its leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of the operating partnership’s debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Operating partnership’s share of total debt is not intended to reflect the operating partnership’s actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. For a reconciliation of operating partnership’s share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure, please see the table of debt maturities and capitalization above. Liquidity of the Operating Partnership As of December 31, 2009, the operating partnership had $187.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and $18.9 million in restricted cash. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the operating partnership increased the availability under its lines of credit by approximately $441 million while reducing its share of outstanding debt by approximately $713 million. As of December 31, 2009, the operating partnership had $1.2 billion available for future borrowings under its three multi-currency lines of credit, representing line utilization of 30%. The operating partnership’s available cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in its operating accounts. The invested cash is invested in money market funds that invest solely in direct obligations of the government of the United States or in time deposits with certain financial institutions. To date, the operating partnership has experienced no loss or lack of access to its invested cash or cash equivalents; however, the operating partnership can provide no assurances that access to its invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. At any point in time, the operating partnership also has a significant amount of cash deposits in its operating accounts that are with third party financial institutions, which was, as of December 31, 2009, approximately $159.4 million on a consolidated basis. These balances exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. While the operating partnership monitors daily the cash balances in its operating accounts and adjusts the cash balances as appropriate, these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets. To date, the operating partnership has experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in its operating accounts. The following table sets forth the operating partnership’s distributions paid or payable per unit for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: For the Years Ended December 31, Paying Entity Security 2009 2008 2007 AMB Property, L.P.

Class B common limited partnership units $ 1.12 $ 1.56 $ 2.00 AMB Property II, L.P. Series D preferred units $ 2.69 $ 3.59 $ 3.64 The operating partnership anticipates that it will be required to use proceeds from debt and equity financings and the divestitures of properties, in addition to cash from its operations, to make its distribution payments and repay its maturing debt as it comes due. However, the operating partnership may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. The operating partnership’s inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay cash 83 Table of Contents distributions to its unitholders and make payments to its noteholders. The operating partnership is currently exploring various options to monetize its development assets including contribution to funds where investment capacity is available, the formation of joint ventures and the sale of assets to third parties. The operating partnership is also exploring the potential sale of operating assets to further enhance liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that the operating partnership will choose to or be able to monetize any of its assets. Cash flows generated by the operating partnership’s business were sufficient to cover its distributions for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, including its distributions to the parent company, which are, in turn, paid to the parent company’s stockholders as dividends and distributions. Cash flows from the operating partnership’s real estate operations and private capital businesses, which are included in “Net cash provided by operating activities” in its Cash Flows from Operating Activities and cash flows from its real estate development and operations businesses which are included in “Net proceeds from divestiture of real estate” in its Cash Flows from Investing Activities in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, were sufficient to pay distributions on common and preferred limited partnership units of the operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. and distributions to noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2007, Cash Flows from Operating Activities alone were not sufficient to pay such dividends and distributions, as shown in the table below. The operating partnership uses proceeds from its businesses included in Cash Flows from Investing Activities (specifically, the proceeds from sales and contributions of properties as part of its real estate development and operations businesses) to fund distributions not covered by Cash Flows from Operating Activities. The following table sets forth the summary of the operating partnership’s distributions paid or payable for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: For the Years Ended December 31, Summary of Distributions Paid 2009 2008 2007 (dollars in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 242,276 $ 301,020 $ 240,543 Distributions paid to partners (139,515 ) (224,549 ) (211,744 ) Distributions to noncontrolling interests, including preferred units (18,771 ) (61,934 ) (137,722 ) Excess (deficit) of net cash provided by operating activities over distributions paid $ 83,990 $ 14,537 $ (108,923 ) Net proceeds from divestiture of real estate $ 482,515 $ 421,647 $ 824,628 Excess of net cash provided by operating activities and net proceeds from divestiture of real estate over distributions paid $ 566,505 $ 436,184 $ 715,705 Capital Commitments of the Operating Partnership Lease Commitments. The operating partnership has entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on-tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from 1 to 54 years. The buildings and improvements subject to these ground leases are amortized ratably over the lesser of the terms of the related leases or 40 years. Future minimum rental payments required under non-cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2009 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2010 $ 37,603 2011 35,943 2012 33,085 2013 31,393 2014 28,769 Thereafter 435,722 Total $ 602,515 84 Table of Contents Co-Investment Ventures. The operating partnership enters into co-investment ventures with institutional investors, acting as the general partner or manager of such ventures. These co-investment ventures are managed by the operating partnership’s private capital group and provide the company with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2009, the operating partnership had investments in co-investment ventures with a gross book value of $1.1 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and net equity investments in five unconsolidated co-investment ventures of $392.6 million and a gross book value of $6.6 billion. As of December 31, 2009, the operating partnership may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co-investment ventures of up to $24.6 million pursuant to the terms of the co-investment venture agreements. From time to time, the operating partnership may raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open-ended unconsolidated co-investment venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, most of whom invest through a private real estate investment trust, and for AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, an open-ended unconsolidated co-investment venture formed in 2007 with institutional investors. This would increase the operating partnership’s obligation to make additional capital commitments to these ventures. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and the management regulations of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, the operating partnership is obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments until such time when its total equity commitment is greater than $150.0 million or 150.0 million Euros, respectively, at which time, its obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. The operating partnership expects to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under its credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely affect its cash flow. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, the operating partnership formed a wholly-owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd. (Arcata), which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the attachment point of the operating partnership’s third-party insurance policies. The captive insurance company is one element of the operating partnership’s overall risk management program. The company capitalized Arcata in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata establishes annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of the operating partnership’s properties. Like premiums paid to third-party insurance companies, premiums paid to Arcata may be reimbursed by customers pursuant to specific lease terms. Through this structure, the operating partnership believes that it has more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Contingent and Unknown Liabilities. Contingent and unknown liabilities may include the following: • liabilities for environmental conditions; • losses in excess of insured coverage; • claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with the company’s predecessors prior to the company’s formation or acquisition transactions that had not been asserted or were unknown prior to the operating partnership’s formation or acquisition transactions; • claims for indemnification by the general partners, officers and directors and others indemnified by the former owners of the operating partnership’s properties; • accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and • tax, legal and regulatory liabilities. 85 Table of Contents Capital Deployment Land acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 The Americas: Acres 4 197 Estimated build out potential (square feet) — 3,537,632 Investment(1) $ 1,539 $ 88,436 Europe: Acres 2 72 Estimated build out potential (square feet) 67,805 1,613,087 Investment(1) $ 5,656 $ 66,850 Asia: Acres 38 111 Estimated build out potential (square feet) 1,075,819 4,371,377 Investment(1) $ 17,032 $ 61,776 Total: Acres 44 380 Estimated build out potential (square feet) 1,143,624 9,522,096 Investment(1) $ 24,227 $ 217,062 (1) Represents actual cost incurred to date including initial acquisition, associated closing costs, infrastructure and associated capitalized interest and overhead costs.

Overview of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our debt, interest and lease payments due by period as of December 31, 2009 (dollars in thousands): Less than More than Contractual Obligations 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years Total Debt $ 626,600 $ 1,411,288 $ 370,641 $ 813,877 $ 3,222,406 Debt interest payments 19,894 54,756 22,136 50,543 147,329 Operating lease commitments 37,603 69,028 60,162 435,722 602,515 Total $ 684,097 $ 1,535,072 $ 452,939 $ 1,300,142 $ 3,972,250 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Standby Letters of Credit. As of December 31, 2009, the company had provided approximately $15.2 million in letters of credit, of which $12.8 million were provided under the operating partnership’s $550.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees and Contribution Obligations. Excluding parent guarantees associated with debt or contribution obligations as discussed in Part IV, Item 15: Notes 6, 7 and 13 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” as of December 31, 2009, the company had outstanding guarantees and contribution obligations in the aggregate amount of $415.6 million as described below. As of December 31, 2009, the company had outstanding bank guarantees in the amount of $0.4 million used to secure contingent obligations, primarily obligations under development and purchase agreements. As of December 31, 2009, the company also guaranteed $47.9 million and $106.7 million on outstanding loans on six of its consolidated joint ventures and four of its unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively. Also, the company has entered into contribution agreements with certain of its unconsolidated co-investment ventures. These contribution agreements require the company to make additional capital contributions to the applicable co-investment venture fund upon certain defaults by the co-investment venture of certain of its debt obligations to the lenders. Such additional capital contributions will cover all or part of the applicable co-investment venture’s debt obligation and may be greater than the company’s share of the co-investment venture’s debt obligation or the value of the company’s share of any property securing such debt. The company’s contribution obligations under these agreements will be reduced by the amounts recovered by the lender and the fair market value of the property, if any, used to secure the debt and obtained by the lender upon default. The company’s potential obligations under these contribution agreements totaled $260.6 million as of December 31, 2009. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2009, the company had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $5.1 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of the company’s development projects and were posted to guarantee certain property tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the property taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promote Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, the company may be obligated to make payments to certain of its joint venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with the company. From time to time in the normal course of its business, the company enters into various contracts with third parties that may obligate the company to make payments, pay promotes, or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. 87 Table of Contents SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES Funds From Operations (“FFO”) and Funds From Operations Per Share and Unit (“FFOPS”) The company believes that net (loss) income, as defined by U.S. GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, the company considers funds from operations, or FFO, and FFO per share and unit, or FFOPS, to be useful supplemental measures of its operating performance. The company defines FFOPS as FFO per fully diluted weighted average share of the parent company’s common stock and operating partnership units. The company calculates FFO as net (loss) income available to common stockholders, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate-related depreciation, and adjustments to derive the company’s pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. The company includes the gains from development, including those from value-added conversion projects, before depreciation recapture, as a component of FFO. The company believes gains from development should be included in FFO to more completely reflect the performance of one of its lines of business. The company believes that value-added conversion dispositions are in substance land sales and as such should be included in FFO, consistent with the real estate investment trust industry’s long standing practice to include gains on the sale of land in FFO. However, the company’s interpretation of FFO or FFOPS may not be consistent with the views of others in the real estate investment trust industry, who may consider it to be a divergence from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) definition, and may not be comparable to FFO or FFOPS reported by other real estate investment trusts that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than the company does. In connection with the formation of a joint venture, the company may warehouse assets that are acquired with the intent to contribute these assets to the newly formed venture. Some of the properties held for contribution may, under certain circumstances, be required to be depreciated under U.S. GAAP. If this circumstance arises, the company intends to include in its calculation of FFO gains or losses related to the contribution of previously depreciated real estate to joint ventures. Although such a change, if instituted, will be a departure from the current NAREIT definition, the company believes such calculation of FFO will better reflect the value created as a result of the contributions. To date, the company has not included gains or losses from the contribution of previously depreciated warehoused assets in FFO. The company believes that FFO and FFOPS are meaningful supplemental measures of its operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, FFO and FFOPS are supplemental measures of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that exclude historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net (loss) income available to common stockholders, as defined by U.S. GAAP. The company believes that the use of FFO and FFOPS, combined with the required U.S. GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. The company considers FFO and FFOPS to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO and FFOPS can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO and FFOPS are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, FFO and FFOPS do not represent cash flow from operations or net (loss) income as defined by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating the company’s liquidity or operating performance. FFO and FFOPS also do not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to the company’s real estate assets nor are FFO and FFOPS necessarily indicative of cash available to fund the company’s future cash requirements. Management compensates for the limitations of FFO and FFOPS by providing investors with financial statements prepared according to U.S. GAAP, along with this detailed discussion of FFO and FFOPS and a reconciliation of FFO and FFOPS to net (loss) income available to common stockholders, a U.S. GAAP measurement. 88 Table of Contents The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled from net (loss) income available to common unitholders of the operating partnership and common stockholders of the parent company for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts): For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Net (loss) income available to common unitholders of the operating partnership $ (50,866 ) $ (67,233 ) $ 305,241 Net loss (income) available to common unitholders of the operating partnership attributable to limited partners of the operating partnership 789 782 (11,689 ) Net (loss) income available to common stockholders of the parent company (50,077 ) (66,451 ) 293,552 Gains from sale or contribution of real estate interests, net (38,718 ) (22,561 ) (85,559 ) Depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 179,894 164,188 157,290 Discontinued operations’ depreciation 2,042 5,011 6,436 Non-real estate depreciation (8,593 ) (7,270 ) (5,623 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from consolidated joint ventures: Joint venture partners’ noncontrolling interests (Net income) 11,063 32,855 27,235 Limited partnership unitholders’ noncontrolling interests (Net (loss) income) (3,625 ) (5,063 ) 6,019 Limited partnership unitholders’ noncontrolling interests (Development gains) 2,377 2,822 7,148 FFO attributable to noncontrolling interests (26,695 ) (49,957 ) (62,902 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures: The company’s share of net loss (11,331 ) (17,121 ) (7,467 ) The company’s share of FFO 42,938 42,742 27,391 Allocation to participating securities(1) — — (418 ) Funds from operations $ 99,275 $ 79,195 $ 363,102 Basic FFO per common share and unit $ 0.72 $ 0.78 $ 3.58 Diluted FFO per common share and unit $ 0.72 $ 0.77 $ 3.49 Weighted average common shares and units: Basic 137,740,825 101,253,972 101,550,001 Diluted 137,903,929 102,734,827 103,961,648 (1) To be consistent with the company’s policies of determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities and accounting for earnings per share, the FFO per common share and unit is adjusted for FFO distributed through declared dividends and allocated to all participating securities (weighted average common shares and units outstanding and unvested restricted shares outstanding) under the two-class method. Under this method, allocations were made to 918,753, 855,919 and 652,838 unvested restricted shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Same Store Net Operating Income (“SS NOI”) The company defines net operating income, or NOI, as rental revenues, including reimbursements, less property operating expenses. NOI excludes depreciation, amortization, general and administrative expenses, restructuring charges, real estate impairment losses, development profits (losses), gains (losses) from sale or contribution of real estate interests, and interest expense. The company believes that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, NOI is a useful supplemental measure calculated to help investors understand the company’s operating performance, excluding the effects of costs and expenses which are not related to the performance of the assets. NOI is widely used by the real estate industry as a useful supplemental measure, which helps investors compare the company’s operating performance with that of other companies. Real estate impairment losses have been excluded in deriving NOI because the company does not consider its impairment losses to be a property operating expense. The company believes that the exclusion of impairment losses from NOI is a common methodology used in the real estate industry. Real estate impairment 89 Table of Contents losses relate to the changing values of the company’s assets but do not reflect the current operating performance of the assets with respect to their revenues or expenses. The company’s real estate impairment losses are non-cash charges which represent the write down in the value of assets when estimated fair value over the holding period is lower than current carrying value. The impairment charges were principally a result of increases in estimated capitalization rates and deterioration in market conditions that adversely impacted underlying real estate values. Therefore, the impairment charges are not related to the current performance of the company’s real estate operations and should be excluded from its calculation of NOI. The company considers same store net operating income, or SS NOI, and cash-basis SS NOI to be useful supplemental measures of its operating performance for properties that are considered part of the same store pool. The company defines SS NOI as NOI on a same store basis. The company defines cash-basis SS NOI as SS NOI excluding straight-line rents and amortization of lease intangibles. The same store pool includes all properties that are owned as of the end of both the current and prior year reporting periods and excludes development properties for both the current and prior reporting periods. The same store pool is set annually and excludes properties purchased and developments stabilized after December 31, 2007. The company considers cash-basis SS NOI to be an appropriate and useful supplemental performance measure because it reflects the operating performance of the real estate portfolio excluding effects of non-cash adjustments and provides a better measure of actual cash-basis rental growth for a year-over-year comparison. In addition, the company believes that SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI help investors compare the operating performance of its real estate as compared to other companies. While SS NOI and cash-basis SSNOI are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, they do not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating the company’s liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI also do not reflect general and administrative expenses, interest expenses, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact the company’s results from operations. Further, the company’s computation of SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI. The following table reconciles SS NOI, cash-basis SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI, excluding lease termination fees from net (loss) income for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Net (loss) income $ (27,960 ) $ (6,750 ) $ 371,716 Private capital revenues (37,879 ) (68,470 ) (31,707 ) Depreciation and amortization 179,894 164,188 157,290 Real estate impairment losses 174,410 183,754 900 General and administrative and fund costs 116,315 145,040 130,584 Restructuring charges 6,368 12,306 — Total other income and expenses 90,484 20,213 (95,235 ) Total discontinued operations (94,725 ) (4,558 ) (83,450 ) Net operating income 406,907 445,723 450,098 Less non same-store NOI (77,719 ) (96,766 ) (28,414 ) Less non-cash adjustments(1) (398 ) (891 ) (6,214 ) Cash-basis same-store NOI $ 328,790 $ 348,066 $ 415,470 Less lease termination fees (2,613 ) (5,498 ) (327 ) Cash-basis same-store NOI, excluding lease termination fees $ 326,177 $ 342,568 $ 415,143 (1) Non-cash adjustments include straight-line rents and amortization of lease intangibles for the same store pool only. 90 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. The company’s future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, the company manages its market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, payments to noteholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of the company’s outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimize the risk of fluctuating interest rates. The company’s exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with its credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and its ability to incur more debt without stockholder and unitholder approval, thereby increasing its debt service obligations, which could adversely affect its cash flows. As of December 31, 2009, the company had one outstanding interest rate swap, four outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts and two interest rate caps with an aggregate notional amount of $836.4 million (in U.S. dollars). See “Financial Instruments” below.

As of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, variable rate debt comprised 38.8% and 38.0%, respectively, of all the company’s outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. Financial Instruments. The company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability. For derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges, the offset to this entry is to accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders’ equity for the parent company, partners’ capital for the operating partnership or income. For derivatives which do not qualify as cash flow hedges, the offset to the change in fair value on the derivative asset or liability is recorded directly in earnings as gains or losses through other income (expenses). For revenues or expenses denominated in non-functional currencies, the company may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. The company’s derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2009 were one interest rate swap and two interest rate caps hedging cash flows of variable rate borrowings based on U.S. LIBOR and four foreign exchange forward contracts hedging intercompany loans. The company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. 91 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the company’s financial instruments as of December 31, 2009 (in thousands): March 31, September 4, November 1, October 1, Notional Related Derivatives 2010 2010 2010 2012 Amount Fair Value Interest Rate Swaps (USD) Trade Notional Amount $ 130,000 $ 130,000 Receive Floating(%) 3 mo.

The company’s exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the company’s subsidiaries operating in the United States, Mexico and certain subsidiaries in Europe. The functional currency for the company’s subsidiaries operating outside the United States, other than Mexico and certain subsidiaries in Europe, is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity or property is located, mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses. The company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. The company translates income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The (losses) gains resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders’ equity for the parent company or partners’ capital for the operating partnership and totaled $(22.0) million and $23.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The company’s international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non-monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange 92 Table of Contents rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. The company also records gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, total unrealized and realized (losses) gains from remeasurement and translation included in the company’s results of operations were $(7.2) million, $(5.7) million and $3.9 million, respectively.",2023-12-30 18:37:16.940349

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management’s Overview The global economic recovery gained momentum in 2010, which made it possible for the company to successfully execute on its key growth initiatives for the year. In recognition of the improving capital markets and operating fundamentals around the world, management believes that the company has a leading position and competitive advantage in pursuing growth opportunities. As such, the company’s three priorities for 2011 are to: • increase the utilization of its assets; • scale the organization and become more profitable; and • form new co-investment ventures and funds. Management believes the pace of the global economic recovery is strengthening and expects to see earnings growth if the company is able to improve asset utilization by returning its owned and managed portfolio closer to its historical occupancy average of 95%; complete the lease-up of its development portfolio; and realize value from its land bank through new ventures, sales and future build-to-suit projects. Management believes the U.S. is in the early stages of the inventory rebuilding process and that the slower than normal rebuild does not signify a secular change in global supply chain practices, but rather inventories were drawn down to unsustainable levels due to stronger than anticipated holiday retail sales. The company believes that capital deployment opportunities are increasing and is currently evaluating multiple opportunities in its target markets around the globe. Management believes that its ability to provide multiple forms of consideration to institutional investors, lenders and private developers provide the company with proprietary access to acquisition opportunities. Additionally, management believes its existing and new private capital co-investment ventures and joint ventures are well positioned to benefit from the expected shift in customer demand for high-quality, well-located industrial real estate. Strength of Balance Sheet and Liquidity The company completed more than $1.9 billion of financings during the fourth quarter. This activity included $1.5 billion of wholly-owned debt consisting of the renewal of its two lines of credit, a corporate term loan, a new bond issuance, and $391 million for its co-investment ventures in Europe, Japan and the U.S. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the company completed financings of approximately $4.0 billion. These transactions further improved and extended the weighted average remaining life of the company’s share of debt to 4.8 years from 3.8 years at an average interest rate of 4.6 percent. As of December 31, 2010 the company’s share of total debt to share of total assets was 43 percent, which includes its share of joint venture debt. As of December 31, 2010 the company’s share of liquidity was approximately $1.6 billion, consisting of approximately $1.4 billion of availability on its lines of credit and more than $260 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. Real Estate Operations Fundamentals in the U.S. industrial real estate market further improved in the fourth quarter. According to CBRE Econometric Advisors, the availability rate declined 30 basis points to 14.3% and net absorption was positive 33.2 million square feet. This is the largest improvement in net absorption in three years as well as more than four times the level reached in the third quarter. The recovery was more broad-based in the fourth quarter with approximately three quarters of the markets in the U.S. reflecting positive net absorption, which represents a 25 point increase from the third quarter. Availabilities in the coastal markets declined 30 basis points to 12.0% after peaking at 12.5% in the first quarter 2010. The company continues to believe that record-low construction, when met by stronger demand, will drive the availability rate back down and that there will be a substantial improvement in net absorption in 2011. Cash-basis same-store net operating income (“SS NOI”), without the effects of lease termination fees, increased 0.9 percent during the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009, driven by increases in occupancy. This increase in quarterly SS NOI marked the first positive year-over-year performance since the fourth quarter of 2008. SS NOI for the full year 2010 decreased 3.2 percent. 59 Table of Contents Rent changes on rollovers declined 11.9% on a trailing four-quarter basis and decreased 11.6% for the quarter. Rent changes on rollover were negative for 2010, although management believes net effective rents have bottomed in most of the company’s markets today. Capital Deployment The company commenced new development in the fourth quarter totaling approximately 695,800 square feet (64,640 square meters) and approximately 1.6 million square feet (150,150 square meters) during 2010 in Brazil, China and Mexico, with an estimated total investment of $102.9 million. During the quarter, acquisitions totaled $144.2 million, including $54.5 million for AMB U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P. and $89.7 million for AMB Europe Logistics Fund, FCP-FIS. The company also acquired a 50% interest in a joint venture mortgage debt investment for $86.0 million. As of December 31, 2010, the company held a total of 2,641 acres of land for future development or sale on an owned and managed basis, approximately 87% of which is located in the Americas. The company currently estimates that these 2,641 acres of land could support approximately 47.4 million square feet of future development. Private Capital Business During 2010, the company raised a record $781.4 million in third party private equity. As of December 31, 2010, the company had assets under management in nine significant co-investment ventures with a gross book value of approximately $8.2 billion. On December 22, 2010, the company announced the formation of AMB Brazil Logistics Partners Fund I, L.P., a co-investment venture with a third-party investor whose strategy is to develop, acquire, own, operate, manage and dispose of logistics properties primarily within the company’s target markets in Brazil, namely São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. This venture will invest through an equity interest in the joint venture previously established between the company and its local Brazil partner, Cyrela Commercial Properties. The initial third-party equity investment will be approximately 360.0 million Brazilian Reais (approximately $216.9 million in U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2010) and the joint venture’s overall equity commitment is 720.0 million Brazilian Reais (approximately $433.8 million in U.S. dollars using the same exchange rate), including the company’s 50 percent co-investment. On August 2, 2010, the company announced the formation of AMB Mexico Fondo Logistico, a publicly traded co-investment venture with a 10-year term whose investment strategy is to develop, acquire, own, operate and manage industrial distribution facilities primarily within the company’s target markets in Mexico. Approximately 3.3 billion Pesos was raised from the third party investors in the venture, comprised of institutional investors in Mexico, primarily private pension plans. These contributions, net of offering costs, held partially in Pesos and U.S. dollars, totaled approximately $252.2 million using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2010. The company will contribute 20% of the total equity, or approximately $63.1 million using the same exchange rate, at full deployment. During 2010, in addition to the commitments of third-party equity in AMB Brazil Logistics Partners Fund I, L.P. and AMB Mexico Fondo Logistico, the company’s two open-ended funds received capital commitments comprising $257.0 million in third-party equity in AMB U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P. and $55.3 million in third-party equity in AMB Europe Logistics Fund, FCP-FIS. As of July 13, 2010, the members of AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC agreed to an early termination of the investment period of, and acquisition exclusivity in favor of, AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC. Equity holders in two of the company’s co-investment ventures, AMB U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P. and AMB Europe Logistics Fund, FCP-FIS, have a right to request that the ventures redeem their interests under certain conditions. The redemption right of investors in AMB Europe Logistics Fund, FCP-FIS is exercisable beginning after July 1, 2011. As of December 31, 2010, there was no redemption queue for AMB U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P. 60 Table of Contents Summary of Key Transactions During the year ended December 31, 2010, the company completed the following significant transactions: • Issued approximately 18.2 million shares of common stock at a price of $27.50 per share, generating approximately $479 million in net proceeds; • Issued $300.0 million of senior unsecured notes at 4.50% due 2017; • Issued $175.0 million of senior unsecured notes at 4.00% due 2018; • Acquired 16 properties aggregating approximately 4.8 million square feet for an aggregate price of $343.3 million, including approximately 1.1 million square feet for $36.9 million for the company, as well as 2.2 million square feet for $174.8 million and 1.5 million square feet for $131.6 million, respectively, for AMB U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P. and AMB Europe Logistics Fund, FCP-FIS, which are unconsolidated co-investment ventures; • Acquired a 50% equity interest in a joint venture mortgage debt investment for $86.0 million; • Acquired three land parcels totaling 192 acres in Brazil for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $39.9 million, the company’s first acquisitions with the company’s joint venture partner, CCP, and commenced development of 0.6 million square feet of properties; • Formed AMB Brazil Logistics Partners Fund I, L.P., a co-investment venture with a third-party investor whose strategy is to develop, acquire, own, operate, manage and dispose of logistics properties primarily within the company’s target markets in Brazil, namely São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and contributed the company’s equity investment in the company’s joint venture with CCP into AMB Brazil Logistics Partners Fund I, L.P.; • Formed AMB Mexico Fondo Logistico, a publicly traded co-investment venture with a 10-year term whose investment strategy is to develop, acquire, own, operate and manage industrial distribution facilities primarily within the company’s target markets in Mexico, with third-party institutional investors in Mexico, primarily private pension plans; • Contributed two completed development projects aggregating approximately 0.2 million square feet to AMB Europe Logistics Fund, FCP-FIS in exchange for units with a fair value of $22.4 million; • Sold development projects aggregating approximately 0.5 million square feet to third-parties, including 0.2 million square feet that was part of an installment sale initiated in the fourth quarter of 2009 and completed in the first quarter of 2010, for an aggregate sales price of approximately $36.4 million, of which $12.5 million related to the installment sale; • Sold industrial operating properties aggregating approximately 1.7 million square feet for an aggregate sales price of $94.5 million; • Invested $200 million in AMB U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P. and $100 million in AMB Europe Logistics Fund, FCP-FIS; and • Raised $781.4 in third-party equity commitments to the company’s unconsolidated co-investment ventures. See Part I, Item 1, Notes 3 and 4 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a more detailed discussion of the company’s acquisition, development and disposition activity. Critical Accounting Policies The company’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The company evaluates its assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis. The company bases its estimates on historical experience and 61 Table of Contents on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, an adjustment to the carrying value of the property is made to reduce it to its estimated fair value. The company also regularly reviews the impact of above or below-market leases, in-place leases and lease origination costs for acquisitions, and records an intangible asset or liability accordingly. The company conducts a comprehensive review of all real estate asset classes in accordance with its policy of accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, which indicates that asset values should be analyzed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable. The intended use of an asset, either held for sale or held for the long term, can significantly impact how impairment is measured. If an asset is intended to be held for the long term, the impairment analysis is based on a two-step test. The first test measures estimated expected future cash flows over the holding period, including a residual value (undiscounted and without interest charges), against the carrying value of the property. If the asset fails the test, then the asset carrying value is measured against the estimated fair value from a market participant standpoint, with the excess of the asset’s carrying value over the estimated fair value recognized as an impairment charge to earnings. If an asset is intended to be sold, impairment is tested based on a one-step test, comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value less costs to sell. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economic and market conditions and the availability of capital. The company determines the estimated fair values based on assumptions regarding rental rates, costs to complete, lease-up and holding periods, as well as sales prices or contribution values. The company also utilizes the knowledge of its regional teams and the recent valuations of its two open-ended funds, which contain a large, geographically diversified pool of assets, all of which are subject to third-party appraisals on at least an annual basis. Revenue Recognition. The company records rental revenue from operating leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases and maintains an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of the company’s customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than the company’s allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then the company may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. The company monitors the liquidity and creditworthiness of its customers on an on-going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate. Each period the company reviews its outstanding accounts receivable, including straight-line rents, for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed. The company also records lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with the company and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to the company. If a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customer’s occupancy. Property Dispositions. The company reports real estate dispositions in four separate categories on its consolidated statements of operations. First, when the company divests a portion of its interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by third-party investors for cash and are included in gains from sale or contribution of real estate interests in the statements of operations. Second, the company disposes of value-added conversion projects and build-to-suit and speculative development projects for which it has not generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable, and is included in development profits, net of taxes, within continuing operations of the statements of operations. Third, the company disposes of value-added conversion and other redevelopment projects for which it may have generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable, in the development profits, net of taxes, line within discontinued operations. Lastly, guidance related to accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets requires the company to separately report as discontinued operations the historical 62 Table of Contents operating results attributable to industrial operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties, which is included in development profits and gains from sale of real estate interests, net of taxes, in the statements of operations. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also retrospectively adjusted to conform with guidance regarding accounting for discontinued operations and noncontrolling interests, and there is no impact on the company’s previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met. Joint Ventures. The company holds interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. The company consolidates joint ventures where it exhibits financial or operational control. Control is determined using accounting standards related to the consolidation of joint ventures and variable interest entities. In June 2009, the FASB issued amended guidance related to the consolidation of variable-interest entities. These amendments require an enterprise to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (“VIE”) based on whether the entity (1) has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the VIE, and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Additionally, they require an ongoing reconsideration of the primary beneficiary and provide a framework for the events that trigger a reassessment of whether an entity is a VIE. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009, and the company has adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2010. The company has evaluated the impact of the adoption of this guidance, and it did not have a material impact on the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. For joint ventures that are defined as variable interest entities, the primary beneficiary consolidates the entity. In instances where the company is not the primary beneficiary, it does not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures that are not defined as variable interest entities, management first considers whether the company is the general partner or a limited partner (or the equivalent in such investments which are not structured as partnerships). The company consolidates joint ventures where it is the general partner (or the equivalent) and the limited partners (or the equivalent) in such investments do not have rights which would preclude control and, therefore, consolidation for financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures where the company is the general partner (or the equivalent), but does not control the joint venture as the other partners (or the equivalent) hold substantive participating rights, the company uses the equity method of accounting. For joint ventures where the company is a limited partner (or the equivalent), management considers factors such as ownership interest, voting control, authority to make decisions, and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners (or the equivalent) to determine if the presumption that the general partner controls the entity is overcome. In instances where these factors indicate the company controls the joint venture, the company consolidates the joint venture; otherwise it uses the equity method of accounting. Investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are presented under the equity method. Under the equity method, these investments are initially recognized in the balance sheet at cost and are subsequently adjusted to reflect the company’s proportionate share of net earnings or losses of the joint venture, distributions received, contributions, deferred gains from the contribution of properties and certain other adjustments, as appropriate. When circumstances indicate there may have been a loss in value of an equity investment, the company evaluates the investment for impairment by estimating the company’s ability to recover its investment or if the loss in value is other than temporary. To evaluate whether an impairment is other than temporary, the company considers relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the period of time in any unrealized loss position, the likelihood of a future recovery, and the company’s positive intent and ability to hold the investment until the forecasted recovery. If the company determines the loss in value is other than temporary, the company recognizes an impairment charge to reflect the investment at fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third party appraisals. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, the parent company generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the United States on the net income it distributes currently to its shareholders if it meets minimum distribution requirements, and certain income, asset and share ownership tests. However, some of the company’s subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign entities 63 Table of Contents may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on the company’s taxable income arising from its taxable real estate investment trust subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as depreciation and gain recognition. The company is required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if it is determined, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The company concluded, based on a review of the relative weight of the available evidence, that it was more likely than not that it would not generate sufficient future taxable income to realize certain deferred tax assets. Foreign Currency Remeasurement and Translation. Transactions that require the remeasurement and translation of a foreign currency are recorded according to accounting guidance on foreign currency translation. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the company’s subsidiaries formed in the United States, Mexico and certain subsidiaries in Europe. Other than Mexico and certain subsidiaries in Europe, the functional currency for the company’s subsidiaries operating outside the United States is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity or property is located, mitigating the effect of currency exchange gains and losses. The company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. The company translates income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The company’s international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. In these instances, non-monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. The company also records gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. The same store pool includes all properties that are owned as of the end of both the current and prior year reporting periods and excludes development properties stabilized after December 31, 2008 (generally defined as properties that are 90% occupied). As of December 31, 2010, the same store industrial pool consisted of properties aggregating approximately 68.5 million square feet. The company’s future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition and disposition of additional properties, and expenses may vary materially from historical results.

The increase in rental revenues from development of $8.7 million is primarily due to increased occupancy of the company’s development portfolio as the company continues lease-up of the development pool, along with higher common-area maintenance and real estate tax reimbursement in 2010. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from development projects that have reached certain levels of operation but are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. The increase in these revenues of $27.9 million primarily reflects the further lease-up of the company’s development portfolio and higher occupancy, along with higher common-area maintenance and real estate tax reimbursement in 2010, partially offset by increased free rent. The decrease in private capital revenues of $7.1 million was primarily due to a decrease in incentive and asset management fees recognized in 2010 as compared to fees recognized in the prior year for incentive distributions received from AMB DFS Fund I, LLC and asset management fees received from AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., partially offset by an increase in acquisition fees recognized in 2010.

The 65 Table of Contents increase in development operating costs of $6.6 million was primarily due to an increase in real estate taxes and other operating expenses due to continued lease-up and higher occupancy of the development portfolio. The increase in other industrial operating costs of $2.1 million was primarily due to an increase in utilities, repairs and maintenance expenses, roads and grounds expenses, administrative expenses and ground rent expenses during 2010. The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses of $21.3 million is primarily due to increased asset stabilizations and assets moving out of the held for sale or contribution pools in the early part of 2010. The increase in general and administrative expenses of $9.1 million is primarily due to an increase in professional service expenses, an increase in stock compensation amortization related to additional issuances of stock options and restricted stock in 2010 and a reduction in capitalized development costs, partially offset by decreases in tax expense, office expenses and insurance expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the company recorded $4.9 million in restructuring charges associated with severance and the termination of certain contractual obligations, as compared to $6.4 million recorded in 2009, due to the further implementation of a previously initiated cost reduction plan, which included a reduction in global headcount, office closure costs and the termination of certain contractual obligations. The company did not record any real estate impairment losses in 2010. See Part IV, Item 15: Note 2 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a more detailed discussion of the real estate impairment losses recorded in the company’s results of operations during 2009. Other expenses decreased $5.5 million primarily as a result of a change in the assets and liabilities associated with the company’s non-qualified deferred compensation plan as well as a decrease in dead deal costs from prior year, partially offset by an increase of acquisition costs in 2010.

The increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures of $6.1 million in 2010 was primarily due to impairment losses recognized on the company’s unconsolidated assets under management during 2009. Interest expense increased $11.4 million over the same period in 2009 primarily due to an additional bond issuance in the fourth quarter of 2009, along with higher line utilization in 2010. Loss on early extinguishment of debt decreased by 66 Table of Contents $9.4 million primarily due to the completion of the repurchase of bonds in connection with the company’s tender offers in 2009.

(previously, a consolidated co-investment venture) to AMB U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P., an unconsolidated co-investment venture, on July 1, 2008. Same store rental revenues for the year ended 2008 would have been $522.7 million if the interests in AMB Partners II, L.P. had been contributed as of January 1, 2008, rather than July 1, 2008. The decrease of $25.3 million, excluding the effect of the contribution of interests in AMB Partners II, L.P., was primarily due to decreased occupancy during 2009. The increase in rental revenues from development of $10.8 million is primarily due to further lease-up of the development pool and increased occupancy at several of the company’s development projects. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from development projects that have reached certain levels of operation but are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. The increase in these revenues of $23.8 million primarily reflects further lease-up of the development pool and an increase in the number of projects that reached these levels of operation in 2009. The decrease in private capital revenues of $30.5 million was primarily due to a decrease in incentive and acquisition fees recognized in 2009 from fees recognized in the prior year. In 2009, the company recognized incentive distributions from AMB DFS Fund I, LLC and asset management fees received from AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., and in 2008, the company received incentive distributions from AMB U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P. and in connection with the sale of the partnership interests in AMB/Erie, L.P., including its final real estate asset to AMB U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P.

(previously, a consolidated co-investment venture) to AMB U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P., an unconsolidated co-investment venture, on July 1, 2008. Same store operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 would have been $147.6 million if the interests in AMB Partners II, L.P. had been contributed as of January 1, 2008. The increase of $3.6 million, excluding the effect of the contribution of interests in AMB Partners II, L.P., was primarily due to increased real estate taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance expenses and ground rent expenses. The increase in development operating costs of $8.2 million was primarily due to an increase in real estate taxes as well as increased utilities, repairs and maintenance expenses, insurance expenses, roads and grounds expenses and ground rent expenses due to higher occupancy in certain development projects. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to unconsolidated co-investment ventures, which are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation but are not yet part of 68 Table of Contents the same store operating pool of properties. The increase in other industrial operating costs of $7.1 million was primarily due to an increase in real estate taxes as well as increased utilities, repairs and maintenance expenses, insurance expenses, roads and grounds expenses and administrative expenses due to an increase in the number of projects that have reached these levels of operation. The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses of $14.3 million was primarily due to $15.5 million additional depreciation expense recorded upon reclassification of assets from properties held for contribution to investments in real estate in 2009 and asset stabilizations, partially offset by the full depreciation expense taken on an asset demolition in the third quarter of 2008. The decrease in general and administrative expenses of $28.6 million in 2009 was primarily due to a personnel and cost reduction plan implemented in the fourth quarter of 2008. During 2009, the company recorded $6.4 million in restructuring charges, as compared to $12.3 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008, due to the further implementation of the cost reduction plan, which included a reduction in global headcount, office closure costs and the termination of certain contractual obligations. See Part IV, Item 15: Note 2 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a more detailed discussion of the real estate impairment losses recorded in the company’s results of operations during 2009 and 2008. The increase in other expenses of $8.2 million was primarily due to changes in the assets and liabilities associated with the company’s non-qualified deferred compensation plan in 2009 as compared to the same period in the prior year, partially offset by a decrease in dead deal costs from amounts recognized in 2008.

As a result, the company recognized a gain of $20.0 million on the contribution, representing the portion of the company’s interest in the contributed property acquired by the third-party investors for cash. The decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures of $5.8 million for 2009 as compared to 2008, was primarily due to lower occupancy in 2009 and impairment losses recognized on the company’s unconsolidated assets under management, partially offset by the contribution of AMB Partners II, L.P. (previously, 69 Table of Contents a consolidated co-investment venture) to AMB U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P., an unconsolidated co-investment venture, on July 1, 2008. Other income (expense) increased $6.6 million in 2009 from the prior year primarily due to a change in the assets and liabilities associated with the company’s non-qualified deferred compensation plan, partially offset by a decrease in bank interest income due to lower cash balances and interest rates in 2009 and an increase in foreign currency exchange rate losses. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the company recognized a loss on currency remeasurement of approximately $7.2 million, compared to a loss of approximately $5.7 million in the same period of 2008.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the company sold value-added conversion development projects and land parcels aggregating approximately 0.2 million square feet and 21 land acres for a sale price of $143.9 million, with a resulting net gain of $53.0 million.

The parent company’s business is operated primarily through the operating partnership. The parent company issues public equity from time to time, but does not otherwise conduct any business or generate any capital itself. The parent company itself does not hold any indebtedness, and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the operating partnership. The parent company’s principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common and preferred stock. The parent company’s principal source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the operating partnership. As of December 31, 2010, the parent company owned an approximate 98.2% general partnership interest in the operating partnership, excluding preferred units. The remaining approximate 1.8% common limited partnership interests are owned by non-affiliated investors and certain current and former directors and officers of the parent company. As of December 31, 2010, the parent company owned all of the preferred limited partnership units of the operating partnership. As the sole general partner of the operating partnership, the parent company has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for the operating partnership’s day-to-day management and control. The parent company causes the operating partnership to distribute all, or such portion as the parent company may in its discretion determine, of its available cash in the manner provided in the operating partnership’s partnership agreement. Generally, if distributions are made, distributions are paid in the following order of priority: first, to satisfy any prior distribution shortfall to the parent company as the holder of preferred units; second, to the parent company as the holder of preferred units; and third, to the holders of common units of the operating partnership, including the parent company, in accordance with the rights of each such class. As general partner with control of the operating partnership, the parent company consolidates the operating partnership for financial reporting purposes, and the parent company does not have significant assets other than its investment in the operating partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of the parent company and the operating partnership are the same on their respective financial statements. However, all debt is held directly or indirectly at the operating partnership level, and the parent company has guaranteed some of the operating partnership’s secured and unsecured debt as discussed below. As the parent company consolidates the operating partnership, the section entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership” should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the company on a consolidated basis and how the company is operated as a whole. Capital Resources of the Parent Company Distributions from the operating partnership are the parent company’s principal source of capital. The parent company receives proceeds from equity issuances from time to time, but is required by the operating partnership’s partnership agreement to contribute the proceeds from its equity issuances to the operating partnership in exchange for partnership units of the operating partnership. As circumstances warrant, the parent company may issue equity from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. The operating partnership may use the proceeds to repay debt, including borrowings under its lines of credit, to make acquisitions of properties, portfolios of properties or U.S. or foreign property-owning or real estate-related entities, to invest in existing or newly created joint ventures or for general corporate purposes. Common and Preferred Equity The parent company has authorized for issuance 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which the following series were designated as of December 31, 2010: 2,300,000 shares of series L cumulative redeemable preferred stock, of which 2,000,000 are outstanding; 2,300,000 shares of series M cumulative redeemable preferred stock, all of which are outstanding; 3,000,000 shares of series O cumulative redeemable preferred stock, all of which are outstanding; and 2,000,000 shares of series P cumulative redeemable preferred stock, all of which are outstanding. 71 Table of Contents In September 2010, the parent company’s board of directors approved a two-year common stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of the parent company’s common stock. The parent company has not repurchased any shares of its common stock under this program.

Such joint ventures held approximately 20.9 million square feet as of December 31, 2010, and are consolidated for financial reporting purposes. Please see “Explanatory Note” on page 1 and Part I, Item 1, Note 10 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a discussion of the noncontrolling interests of the parent company. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, the parent company presently intends over the long term to operate with a parent company’s share of total debt-to-parent company’s share of total market capitalization ratio or parent company’s share of total debt-to-parent company’s share of total assets of approximately 45% or less. In order to operate at this targeted ratio over the long term, the parent company is currently exploring various options to monetize its development assets through possible contribution to funds where capacity is available, the formation of joint ventures and the sale to third parties. It is also exploring the potential sale of industrial operating assets to further enhance liquidity. As of December 31, 2010, the parent company’s share of total debt-to-parent company’s share of total assets ratio was 43.0%. (See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for the definitions of “parent company’s share of total market capitalization,” “market equity,” “parent company’s share of total debt” and “parent company’s share of total assets.”) The parent company typically finances its co-investment ventures with secured debt at a loan-to-value ratio of 50-65% pursuant to its co-investment venture agreements. Additionally, the operating partnership currently intends to manage its capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on its senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, the parent company’s and operating partnership’s 72 Table of Contents organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that either entity may incur. Accordingly, management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder or unitholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render the parent company or the operating partnership unable to comply with these policies. For example, decreases in the market price of the parent company’s common stock have caused an increase in the ratio of parent company’s share of total debt-to-parent company’s share of total market capitalization. Capitalization Ratios as of December 31, 2010 Parent company’s share of total debt-to-parent company’s share of total market capitalization(1) 41.3% Parent company’s share of total debt plus preferred-to-parent company’s share of total market capitalization(1) 43.7% Parent company’s share of total debt-to-parent company’s share of total assets(1) 43.0% Parent company’s share of total debt plus preferred-to-parent company’s share of total assets(1) 45.5% (1) Although the parent company does not hold any indebtedness itself, the parent company’s total debt reflects the consolidation of the operating partnership’s total debt for financial reporting purposes. The parent company’s definition of “total market capitalization” for the parent company is total debt plus preferred equity liquidation preferences plus market equity. The definition of “parent company’s share of total market capitalization” is the parent company’s share of total debt plus preferred equity liquidation preferences plus market equity. The definition of “market equity” is the total number of outstanding shares of common stock of the parent company and common limited partnership units of the operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. multiplied by the closing price per share of the parent company’s common stock as of December 31, 2010. The definition of “preferred” is preferred equity liquidation preferences. “Parent company’s share of total debt” is the parent company’s pro rata portion of the total debt based on the parent company’s percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures holding the debt. “Parent company’s share of total assets” is the parent company’s pro rata portion of the gross book value of real estate interests plus cash and other assets. As of December 31, 2010, the parent company’s share of total assets was approximately $9.3 billion. The parent company believes that share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze the parent company’s leverage and to compare the parent company’s leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of the parent company’s debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Parent company’s share of total debt is not intended to reflect the parent company’s actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. For a reconciliation of parent company’s share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure, please see the table of debt maturities and capitalization in the section below entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership.” Liquidity of the Parent Company The liquidity of the parent company is dependent on the operating partnership’s ability to make sufficient distributions to the parent company. The primary cash requirement of the parent company is its payment of dividends to its stockholders. The parent company also guarantees some of the operating partnership’s secured and unsecured debt described in the “Debt guarantees” section below. If the operating partnership fails to fulfill its debt requirements, which trigger parent guarantee obligations, then the parent company will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees. The parent company believes the operating partnership’s sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations and borrowings available under its unsecured credit facilities, are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to the parent company and, in turn, for the parent company to make its dividend payments to its stockholders. However, there can be no assurance that the operating partnership’s sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs, including its ability to make distribution payments to the parent company. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect the operating partnership’s ability to pay its distributions to the parent company, which will, in turn, adversely affect the parent company’s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and the market price of the parent company’s stock. 73 Table of Contents Should the parent company face a situation in which the operating partnership does not have sufficient cash available through its operations to continue operating its business as usual (including making its distributions to the parent company), the operating partnership may need to find alternative ways to increase the operating partnership’s liquidity. Such alternatives, which would be done through the operating partnership, may include, without limitation, divesting itself of properties and decreasing the operating partnership’s cash distribution to the parent company. Other alternatives are for the parent company to pay some or all of its dividends in stock rather than cash or issuing its equity in public or private transactions whether or not at favorable pricing or on favorable terms. If the operating partnership is unable to obtain new financing or refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then its cash flow may be insufficient to pay its distributions to the parent company, which will have, as a result, insufficient funds to pay cash dividends to the parent company’s stockholders. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the operating partnership’s interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense of the operating partnership would adversely affect the parent company’s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders and the market price of its stock. The operating partnership may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for the parent company’s equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, the parent company’s liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. For the parent company to maintain its qualification as a real estate investment trust, it must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income. While historically the parent company has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its stockholders, it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, the parent company’s own stock. As a result of this distribution requirement, the operating partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its on-going operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not real estate investment trusts can. The parent company may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the operating partnership’s working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. As circumstances warrant, the parent company may issue equity securities from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. The parent company would contribute any such proceeds to the operating partnership, which would then use the proceeds to repay debt, including borrowings under its lines of credit, to make acquisitions of properties, portfolios of properties or U.S. or foreign property-owning or real estate-related entities or platforms, to invest in existing or newly created joint ventures or for general corporate purposes. Dividends. The following table sets forth the parent company’s dividends paid or payable per share for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: Paying Entity Security 2010 2009 2008 AMB Property Corporation Common stock $ 1.12 $ 1.12 $ 1.56 AMB Property Corporation Series L preferred stock $ 1.63 $ 1.63 $ 1.63 AMB Property Corporation Series M preferred stock $ 1.69 $ 1.69 $ 1.69 AMB Property Corporation Series O preferred stock $ 1.75 $ 1.75 $ 1.75 AMB Property Corporation Series P preferred stock $ 1.71 $ 1.71 $ 1.71 The parent company anticipates that the operating partnership will be required to use proceeds from debt and equity financings (including the issuance of equity by the parent company) and the divestiture of properties, in addition to cash from its operations, to make its distribution payments and repay its maturing debt as it comes due. However, the parent company and the operating partnership may not be able to issue such securities on favorable terms or at all. The parent company’s or the operating partnership’s inability to issue securities on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect the operating partnership’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flow and its ability to pay distributions to the parent company, which will, in turn, adversely affect the market price of the parent company’s stock and the parent company’s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders. 74 Table of Contents Cash flows generated by the operating partnership were sufficient to cover the operating partnership’s distributions for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, including its distributions to the parent company, which were, in turn, paid to the parent company’s stockholders as dividends. Cash flows from the operating partnership’s real estate operations and private capital businesses, which are included in “Net cash provided by operating activities” in the parent company’s Cash Flows from Operating Activities and cash flows from the operating partnership’s real estate development and operations businesses which are included in “Net proceeds from divestiture of real estate and securities” in the parent company’s Cash Flows from Investing Activities in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, were sufficient to pay dividends on the parent company’s common stock and preferred stock, distributions on common and preferred limited partnership units of the operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. and distributions to noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. The parent company uses proceeds from the operating partnership included in Cash Flows from Investing Activities (specifically, the proceeds from sales and contributions of properties as part of its real estate development and operations businesses) to fund dividends and distributions not covered by Cash Flows from Operating Activities, if any. The following table sets forth the summary of the parent company’s dividends and the operating partnership’s distributions paid or payable for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: For the Years Ended December 31, Summary of Dividends and Distributions Paid 2010 2009 2008 (dollars in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 252,760 $ 243,113 $ 302,614 Dividends paid to common and preferred stockholders(1) (193,428 ) (137,108 ) (220,476 ) Distributions to noncontrolling interests, including preferred units (13,374 ) (21,178 ) (66,007 ) Excess of net cash provided by operating activities over dividends and distributions paid $ 45,958 $ 84,827 $ 16,131 Net proceeds from divestiture of real estate and securities $ 101,660 $ 482,515 $ 421,647 Excess of net cash provided by operating activities and net proceeds from divestiture of real estate over dividends and distributions paid $ 147,618 $ 567,342 $ 437,778 (1) Partnership unit distributions paid to the parent company by the operating partnership are, in turn, paid by the parent company as dividends to its stockholders. Debt guarantees. The parent company is the guarantor of the operating partnership’s obligations with respect to its unsecured senior debt securities. As of December 31, 2010, the operating partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $1.7 billion in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and had an average term of 6.1 years. The indenture for the senior debt securities contains limitations on mergers or consolidations of the parent company. The parent company guarantees the operating partnership’s obligations with respect to certain of its other debt obligations related to the following two facilities. In November 2010, the operating partnership paid off the outstanding Euro tranche balance of its original $425.0 million multi-currency term loan, which has a maturity of October 2012. As of December 31, 2010, only the Japanese Yen tranche of the term loan had an outstanding balance, which was approximately $153.9 million in U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect on that date, and bore a weighted average interest rate of 3.4%. Additionally, in November 2010, the operating partnership entered into a 153.7 million Euro senior unsecured term loan, maturing in November 2015. Using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2010, the term loan had an outstanding balance of approximately $205.8 million in U.S. dollars, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 2.8%. These term loans contain limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations of the parent company. The parent company is a guarantor of the operating partnership’s obligations under its $600.0 million (includes Euro, Yen, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollar or U.S. dollar denominated borrowings) unsecured revolving credit facility. In November 2010, the operating partnership refinanced its $550.0 million multi-currency facility, 75 Table of Contents which was set to mature in June 2011, increasing the facility by $50.0 million and extending the maturity to March 2014. This facility had no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2010. The parent company, along with the operating partnership, guarantees the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, under its credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the credit agreement. This credit facility has an initial borrowing limit of 45.0 billion Yen, previously 55.0 billion prior to the operating partnership’s early renewal in December 2010, which, using the exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2010, equaled approximately $554.5 million U.S. dollars. Additionally, upon renewal, the credit facility maturity was extended from June 2011 to March 2014. As of December 31, 2010, this facility had a balance of $139.5 million, using the exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2010, and bore a weighted average interest rate of 1.97%. The parent company and the operating partnership guarantee the obligations for such subsidiaries and other entities controlled by the operating partnership that are selected by the operating partnership from time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant to a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The operating partnership and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries, each acting as a borrower, with the parent company and the operating partnership as guarantors, entered into this credit facility, which has an option to extend the maturity date to July 2012. As of December 31, 2010, this facility, maturing in July 2011, had a balance of $129.4 million, using the exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2010, and bore a weighted average interest rate of 1.31%. The credit agreements related to the above facilities contain limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations of the parent company. Potential Contingent and Unknown Liabilities. Contingent and unknown liabilities may include claims for indemnification by officers and directors and tax, legal and regulatory liabilities. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, the operating partnership uses unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, common and preferred equity (issued by the parent company, the operating partnership and their subsidiaries, as applicable) to capitalize its wholly owned assets. Over time, the operating partnership plans to retire non-recourse, secured debt encumbering its wholly owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes where practicable. In managing the co-investment ventures, in general, the operating partnership uses non-recourse, secured debt to capitalize its co-investment ventures. The operating partnership currently expects that its principal sources of working capital and funding for debt service, development, acquisitions, expansion and renovation of properties will include: • cash on hand and cash flow from operations; • borrowings under its unsecured credit facilities; • other forms of secured or unsecured financing; • assumption of debt related to acquired properties; • proceeds from limited partnership unit offerings (including issuances of limited partnership units by the operating partnership’s subsidiaries); • proceeds from debt securities offerings by the operating partnership; • proceeds from equity offerings by the parent company; • net proceeds from divestitures of properties; • private capital from co-investment partners; 76 Table of Contents • net proceeds from contributions of properties and completed development projects to its co-investment ventures; and • net proceeds from the sales of development projects, value-added conversion projects and land to third parties. The operating partnership currently expects that its principal funding requirements will include: • debt service; • distributions on outstanding common, preferred and general partnership units; • working capital; • acquisitions of properties, portfolios of properties, interests in real-estate related entities or platforms; • investments in existing or newly formed joint ventures; and • development, expansion and renovation of properties. Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership The operating partnership believes its sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations, and borrowings available under its unsecured credit facilities, are adequate for it to meet its current liquidity requirements. However, there can be no assurance that the operating partnership’s sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect the operating partnership’s financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and the ability to pay cash distributions to its unitholders and make payments to its noteholders. For the parent company to maintain its qualification as a real estate investment trust, it must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its taxable income. As a result of this distribution requirement, the operating partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its on-going operations to the same extent that other corporations whose parent companies are not real estate investment trusts can. The operating partnership may need to continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund its working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. Cash Flows. For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash provided by operating activities was $252.8 million as compared to $243.1 million for the same period in 2009. This change is primarily due to changes in the operating partnership’s accounts receivable and other assets and accounts payable and other liabilities. Cash used in investing activities was $586.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to cash provided by investing activities of $84.1 million for the same period in 2009. This change is primarily due to a decrease in net proceeds from divestiture of real estate and securities and an increase in additions to interests in unconsolidated joint ventures, partially offset by a decrease in additions to land, buildings, development costs, building improvements and lease costs. Cash provided by financing activities was $329.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to cash used in financing activities of $298.4 million for the same period in 2009. This change is due primarily to a decrease in net payments on unsecured credit facilities and an increase in net proceeds from issuance of senior debt, net of payments. This activity was partially offset by a decrease in the issuance of common units, an increase in distributions paid and an increase in net payments on other debt. Partners’ Capital. As of December 31, 2010, the operating partnership had outstanding 168,506,670 common general partnership units; 2,058,730 common limited partnership units; 2,000,000 6.50% series L cumulative redeemable preferred units; 2,300,000 6.75% series M cumulative redeemable preferred units; 3,000,000 7.00% series O cumulative redeemable preferred units; and 2,000,000 6.85% series P cumulative redeemable preferred units. Development Completions. Development completions are generally defined as properties that are 90% occupied or pre-leased, or that have been substantially complete for at least 12 months. Development completions 77 Table of Contents on a consolidated basis, during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows, excluding value-added acquisitions (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Placed in Operations: Number of projects — 11 Square feet — 3,685,677 Estimated investment(1) $ — $ 264,697 Sold: Number of projects — 3 Square feet — 774,663 Estimated investment(1) $ — $ 62,695 Available for Sale or Contribution: Number of projects 13 24 Square feet 4,504,551 6,669,855 Estimated investment(1) $ 376,890 $ 567,634 Total: Number of projects 13 38 Square feet 4,504,551 11,130,195 Estimated investment(1) $ 376,890 $ 895,026 (1) Estimated investment is before the impact of cumulative real estate impairment losses.

During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the operating partnership did not contribute any industrial operating properties to unconsolidated co-investment ventures. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the operating partnership contributed one industrial operating property for approximately $66.2 million, aggregating approximately 0.8 million square feet, to AMB U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P. As a result, the operating partnership recognized a gain of $20.0 million on the contribution, representing the portion of its interest in the contributed property acquired by third-party investors for cash. These gains are presented in gains from sale or contribution of real estate interests, net, in the consolidated statements of operations. Properties Held for Sale or Contribution, Net. As of December 31, 2010, the operating partnership held for sale ten properties with an aggregate net book value of $55.9 million. These properties either are not in the operating partnership’s core markets, do not meet its current investment objectives, or are included as part of its development-for-sale or value-added conversion programs. The sales of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. Properties held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less costs to sell. As of December 31, 2009, the operating partnership held for sale three properties with an aggregate net book value of $13.9 million. As of December 31, 2010, the operating partnership held for contribution to co-investment ventures eight properties with an aggregate net book value of $186.2 million, which, when contributed, will reduce its average ownership interest in these projects from approximately 90% to an expected range of less than 40%. As of December 31, 2009, the operating partnership held for contribution to co-investment ventures 11 properties with an aggregate net book value of $200.5 million. As of December 31, 2010, no properties were reclassified from held for sale or held for contribution to investments in real estate as a result of the change in management’s intent to hold these assets. In accordance with the operating partnership’s policies of accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, during the year ended December 31, 2010, the operating partnership recognized $1.2 million of additional depreciation expense and related accumulated depreciation from the reclassification of assets from properties held for sale and contribution to investments in real estate. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the operating partnership recognized additional depreciation expense and related accumulated depreciation of $15.5 million as a result of similar reclassifications, as well as impairment charges of $55.8 million on real estate assets held for sale or contribution for which it was determined that the carrying value was greater than the estimated fair value. 79 Table of Contents Gains from Sale of Real Estate Interests, Net of Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the operating partnership sold approximately 1.0 million square feet of industrial operating properties for an aggregate sales price of $58.1 million, with a resulting gain of $19.8 million. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2010, the company recognized a deferred gain of $0.4 million on the divestiture of industrial operating properties, aggregating approximately 0.7 million square feet, for an aggregate sales price of $36.4 million, which was deferred as part of the contribution of AMB Partners II, L.P. to AMB U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P. in July 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the operating partnership sold approximately 2.3 million square feet of industrial operating properties for an aggregate sales price of $151.6 million, with a resulting gain of $37.2 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the operating partnership sold approximately 0.1 million square feet of industrial operating properties for an aggregate sales price of $3.6 million, with a resulting gain of $1.0 million, and it recognized a deferred gain of approximately $1.4 million on the sale of industrial operating properties, aggregating approximately 0.1 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $3.5 million, which were disposed of on December 31, 2007. These gains are presented in gains from sale of real estate interests, net of taxes, as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations. Co-investment Ventures. The operating partnership enters into co-investment ventures with institutional investors, which are managed by the operating partnership’s private capital group and provide it with an additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. The operating partnership holds interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures. Third-party equity interests in the consolidated co-investment ventures are reflected as noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2010, the operating partnership owned approximately 80.8 million square feet of its properties (50.7% of the total operating and development portfolio) through its consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures. The operating partnership may make additional investments through these co-investment ventures or new co-investment ventures in the future and presently plans to do so. On December 22, 2010, the company announced the formation of AMB Brazil Logistics Partners Fund I, L.P., a single-investor co-investment venture whose strategy is to develop, acquire, own, operate, manage and dispose of logistics properties primarily within the company’s target markets in Brazil, namely São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. This venture will invest through an equity interest in the joint venture previously established between the company and its local Brazil partner, Cyrela Commercial Properties. The initial third-party equity investment will be approximately 360.0 million Brazilian Reais (approximately $216.9 million in U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2010) and the joint venture’s overall equity commitment is 720.0 million Brazilian Reais (approximately $433.8 million in U.S. dollars using the same exchange rate), including the company’s 50 percent co-investment. On August 2, 2010, the company announced the formation of AMB Mexico Fondo Logistico, a publicly traded co-investment venture with a 10-year term whose investment strategy is to develop, acquire, own, operate and manage industrial distribution facilities primarily within the company’s target markets in Mexico. Approximately 3.3 billion Pesos was raised from the third party investors in the venture, comprised of institutional investors in Mexico, primarily private pension plans. These contributions, net of offering costs, held partially in Pesos and U.S. dollars, totaled approximately $252.2 million using the exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2010. The company will contribute 20% of the total equity, or approximately $63.1 million, at full deployment, for total equity of $315.3 million available for future investments. Estimated investment capacity in AMB Mexico Fondo Logistico, including the total equity contributions of $315.3 million, is $600 million. 80 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the operating partnership’s significant consolidated co-investment ventures at December 31, 2010 (dollars in thousands): Approximate Original Ownership Planned Consolidated Co-investment Venture Co-investment Venture Partner Percentage Capitalization(1) AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P.

In addition to the equity investments shown above, the operating partnership, through its investment in AMB Property Mexico, held equity interests in various other unconsolidated ventures totaling approximately $13.3 million as of December 31, 2010. Additionally, in December 2010, the company entered into a mortgage debt investment joint venture with a third-party partner and held an equity interest of $86.2 million as of December 31, 2010. Please see Part I, Item 1, Note 12 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a discussion of the operating partnership’s significant unconsolidated co-investment ventures. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, the operating partnership presently intends over the long term to operate with an operating partnership’s share of total debt-to-operating partnership’s share of total market capitalization ratio or operating partnership’s share of total debt-to-operating partnership’s share of total assets of approximately 45% or less. In order to operate at this targeted ratio over the long term, the operating partnership is currently exploring various options to monetize 81 Table of Contents its development assets through possible contribution to funds where capacity is available, the formation of joint ventures and the sale to third parties. The operating partnership is also exploring the potential sale of operating assets to further enhance liquidity. As of December 31, 2010, the operating partnership’s share of total debt-to-operating partnership’s share of total assets ratio was 43.0%. (See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for the definitions of “operating partnership’s share of total market capitalization,” “market capital,” “operating partnership’s share of total debt” and “operating partnership’s share of total assets.”) The operating partnership typically finances its co-investment ventures with secured debt at a loan-to-value ratio of 50-65% per its co-investment venture agreements. Additionally, the operating partnership currently intends to manage its capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on its senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, the operating partnership’s organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that it may incur. Accordingly, management could alter or eliminate these policies without unitholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render it unable to comply with these policies. For example, decreases in the market price of the parent company’s common stock have caused an increase in the ratio of operating partnership’s share of total debt-to-operating partnership’s share of total market capitalization. As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate principal amount of the operating partnership’s secured debt was $1.0 billion, excluding $0.1 million of unamortized net premiums. Of the $1.0 billion of secured debt, $731.2 million, excluding unamortized discounts, is secured by properties in the operating partnership’s joint ventures. Such secured debt is generally non-recourse and, as of December 31, 2010, bore interest at rates varying from 1.0% to 8.3% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 4.3%) and had final maturity dates ranging from July 2011 to November 2022. As of December 31, 2010, $695.7 million of the secured debt obligations bore interest at fixed rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 5.1%), while the remaining $266.6 million bore interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 2.3%). As of December 31, 2010, $586.8 million of the secured debt before unamortized premiums was held by co-investment ventures, including the AMB-SGP, L.P. loan agreement discussed below. On February 14, 2007, seven subsidiaries of AMB-SGP, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, which is a subsidiary of the operating partnership, entered into a loan agreement for a $305.0 million secured financing. On the same day, pursuant to the loan agreement, the same seven subsidiaries delivered four promissory notes to the two lenders, each of which mature in March 2012. One note has a principal of $160.0 million and an interest rate that is fixed at 5.29%. The second note has an initial principal borrowing of $40.0 million with a variable interest rate of 81.0 basis points above the one-month LIBOR rate. The third note has an initial principal borrowing of $84.0 million and a fixed interest rate of 5.90%. The fourth note has an initial principal borrowing of $21.0 million and bears interest at a variable rate of 135.0 basis points above the one-month LIBOR rate. The aggregate principal amount outstanding under this loan agreement as of December 31, 2010 was $289.1 million. As of December 31, 2010, the operating partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $1.7 billion in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% and had an average term of 6.1 years. In August 2010 and November 2010, the operating partnership issued senior unsecured notes of $300.0 million at 4.50% due 2017 and $175.0 million at 4.00% due 2018, respectively. The unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various covenants. The covenants contain affirmative covenants, including compliance with financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. As of December 31, 2010, the operating partnership had $414.0 million outstanding in other debt which bore a weighted average interest rate of 3.3% and had an average term of 3.3 years. Other debt includes a $70.0 million credit facility obtained on August 24, 2007 by AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, which had a $54.3 million balance outstanding as of December 31, 2010. The remaining $359.7 million outstanding in other debt, using the exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2010, is related to the term loans discussed below. In November 2010, the operating partnership paid off the outstanding Euro tranche balance of its original $425.0 million multi-currency term loan, which has a maturity of October 2012. As of December 31, 2010, only the Japanese Yen tranche of the term loan had an outstanding balance, which was approximately $153.9 million in U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate in effect on that date, and bore a weighted average interest rate of 3.4%. Additionally, 82 Table of Contents in November 2010, the operating partnership entered into a 153.7 million Euro senior unsecured term loan, maturing in November 2015. Using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2010, the term loan had an outstanding balance of approximately $205.8 million in U.S. dollars, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 2.8%. The parent company guarantees the operating partnership’s obligations with respect to certain of its unsecured debt. These unsecured credit facilities contain affirmative covenants, including compliance with financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. The operating partnership was in compliance with its financial covenants under its unsecured credit facilities at December 31, 2010. If the operating partnership is unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then its cash flow may be insufficient to pay cash distributions to the operating partnership’s unitholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay cash distributions to its unitholders and make payments to its noteholders. The operating partnership may from time to time seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, its liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. A downgrade in the operating partnership’s credit ratings on its long term debt could adversely affect its business and financial condition. A decrease in the operating partnership’s credit ratings could cause a negative reaction in the public and private markets for the parent company’s and the operating partnership’s securities, increase difficulty in accessing optimally priced financing and damage public perception of the company’s business. Also, if the long-term debt ratings of the operating partnership fall below current levels, the borrowing cost of debt under the operating partnership’s unsecured credit facilities and certain term loans will increase. In addition, if the long-term debt ratings of the operating partnership fall below investment grade, the operating partnership may be unable to request borrowings in currencies other than U.S. dollars or Japanese Yen, as applicable. However, the lack of other currency borrowings does not affect the operating partnership’s ability to fully draw down under the credit facilities or term loans. Also, the operating partnership’s lenders will not be able to terminate its credit facilities or certain term loans in the event that its credit rating falls below investment grade status. None of the operating partnership’s credit facilities contain covenants regarding the parent company’s stock price or market capitalization, thus a decrease in the parent company’s stock price is not expected to impact the operating partnership’s ability to borrow under its existing lines of credit. While the operating partnership currently does not expect its long-term debt ratings to fall below investment grade, in the event that the ratings do fall below those levels, it may be unable to exercise its options to extend the term of its credit facilities and the loss of the operating partnership’s ability to borrow in foreign currencies could affect its ability to optimally hedge its borrowings against foreign currency exchange rate changes. In addition, based on publicly available information regarding its lenders, the operating partnership currently does not expect to lose borrowing capacity under its existing lines of credit as a result of a dissolution, bankruptcy, consolidation, merger or other business combination among its lenders. The operating partnership’s access to funds under its credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the lenders that are parties to such facilities to meet their funding commitments to the operating partnership. If the operating partnership does not have sufficient cash flows and income from its operations to meet its financial commitments and lenders are not able to meet their funding commitments to the operating partnership, the operating partnership’s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. The operating partnership’s primary financial covenants with respect to its credit facilities generally relate to fixed charge or debt service coverage, liabilities to asset value, debt to asset value and unencumbered cash flow. As of December 31, 2010, the operating partnership was in compliance with its financial covenants under its credit 83 Table of Contents facilities. There can be no assurance, however, that if the financial markets and economic conditions worsen, the operating partnership will be able to continue to comply with its financial covenants. Certain of the operating partnership’s third party indebtedness is held by its consolidated or unconsolidated joint ventures. In the event that a joint venture partner is unable to meet its obligations under the operating partnership’s joint venture agreements or the third party debt agreements, the operating partnership may elect to pay its joint venture partner’s portion of debt to avoid foreclosure on the mortgaged property or permit the lender to foreclose on the mortgaged property to meet the joint venture’s debt obligations. In either case, the operating partnership would lose income and asset value on the property. In addition, increases in the cost of credit and difficulty in accessing the capital and credit markets may adversely impact the occupancy of the operating partnership’s properties, the disposition of its properties, private capital raising and contribution of properties to its co-investment ventures. If it is unable to contribute completed development properties to its co-investment ventures or sell its completed development projects to third parties, the operating partnership will not be able to recognize gains from the contribution or sale of such properties and, as a result, the net income available to its common unitholders and its funds from operations will decrease. Additionally, business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns and other similar factors that affect the operating partnership’s customers may adversely impact the operating partnership’s business and financial condition such as occupancy levels of its properties. Furthermore, general uncertainty in the real estate markets has resulted in conditions where the pricing of certain real estate assets may be difficult due to uncertainty with respect to capitalization rates and valuations, among other things, which may add to the difficulty of buyers or the operating partnership’s co-investment ventures to obtain financing on favorable terms to acquire such properties or cause potential buyers to not complete acquisitions of such properties. The market uncertainty with respect to capitalization rates and real estate valuations also adversely impacts the operating partnership’s net asset value. While the operating partnership believes that it has sufficient working capital and capacity under its credit facilities to continue its business operations as usual in the near term, turbulence in the global markets and economies and prolonged declines in business and consumer spending may adversely affect its liquidity and financial condition, as well as the liquidity and financial condition of its customers. If these market conditions persist, recur or worsen in the long term, they may limit the operating partnership’s ability, and the ability of its customers, to timely replace maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs. In the event that it does not have sufficient cash available to it through its operations to continue operating its business as usual, the operating partnership may need to find alternative ways to increase its liquidity. Such alternatives may include, without limitation, divesting the operating partnership of properties, whether or not they otherwise meet its strategic objectives in the long term, at less than optimal terms; issuing and selling the operating partnership’s debt and equity in public or private transactions under less than optimal conditions; entering into leases with the operating partnership’s customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms; entering into lease renewals with the operating partnership’s existing customers with a decrease in rental rates at turnover or on suboptimal terms; or paying a portion of the parent company’s dividends in stock rather than cash. There can be no assurance, however, that such alternative ways to increase its liquidity will be available to the operating partnership. Additionally, taking such measures to increase its liquidity may adversely affect the operating partnership’s business, results of operations and financial condition. As circumstances warrant, the operating partnership may issue debt securities from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. The operating partnership would use the proceeds to repay debt, including borrowings under its lines of credit, to make acquisitions of properties, portfolios of properties or U.S. or foreign property-owning or real estate-related entities or platforms, to invest in newly formed or existing joint ventures, or for general corporate purposes. Credit Facilities. The operating partnership has a $600.0 million (includes Euro, Yen, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollar or U.S. dollar denominated borrowings) unsecured revolving credit facility. In November 2010, the operating partnership refinanced its $550.0 million multi-currency facility, which was set to mature in June 2011, increasing the facility by $50.0 million and extending the maturity to March 2014. The parent company is a guarantor of the operating partnership’s obligations under the credit facility. The facility can be increased to up to $800.0 million upon certain conditions. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, which was 84 Table of Contents 185.0 basis points as of December 31, 2010, based on the operating partnership’s long-term debt rating, with an annual facility fee of 35.0 basis points. If the operating partnership’s long-term debt ratings fall below investment grade, it will be unable to request money market loans and borrowings in Euros, Yen or British pounds sterling. The four-year credit facility includes a multi-currency component, under which up to $600.0 million can be drawn in Euros, Yen, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars or U.S. dollars. The operating partnership uses the credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2010, there was no outstanding balance on this credit facility, and the remaining amount available was $589.6 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $10.4 million, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2010. AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, has a Yen-denominated unsecured revolving credit facility with an initial borrowing limit of 45.0 billion Yen, previously 55.0 billion prior to the operating partnership’s early renewal in December 2010, which, using the exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2010, equaled approximately $554.5 million U.S. dollars and bore a weighted average interest rate of 1.97%. The parent company, along with the operating partnership, guarantees the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan, China and South Korea. Generally, borrowers under the credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. Additionally, upon renewal, the credit facility maturity was extended from June 2011 to March 2014. The rate on the borrowings is generally Yen LIBOR plus a margin, which was 185.0 basis points as of December 31, 2010, based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s long-term debt. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s long-term debt, and was 35.0 basis points as of December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2010, was $139.5 million, and the remaining amount available was $415.0 million. The operating partnership and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries, each acting as a borrower, with the parent company and the operating partnership as guarantors, have a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The parent company, along with the operating partnership, guarantees the obligations for such subsidiaries and other entities controlled by the operating partnership that are selected by the operating partnership from time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant to this credit facility. Generally, borrowers under the credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility. The credit facility includes a multi-currency component under which up to $500.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Singapore dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling and Euros. The line, which matures in July 2011, carries a one-year extension option, which the operating partnership may exercise at its sole option so long as the operating partnership’s long-term debt rating is investment grade, among other things. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, which was 60.0 basis points as of December 31, 2010, based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt, with an annual facility fee based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt. If the operating partnership’s long-term debt ratings fall below investment grade, it will be unable to request borrowings in any currency other than U.S. dollars. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2010, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rates in effect at December 31, 2010, was approximately $129.4 million with a weighted average interest rate of 1.31%, and the remaining amount available was $370.6 million. The above credit facilities contain affirmative covenants, including compliance with financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants of the operating partnership, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. The operating partnership was in compliance with its financial covenants under each of these credit agreements as of December 31, 2010. 85 Table of Contents The tables below summarize the operating partnership’s debt maturities, principal payments and capitalization and reconcile operating partnership’s share of total debt to total consolidated debt as of December 31, 2010 (dollars in thousands): Wholly Owned Unsecured Total Consolidated Total Unconsolidated AMB’s Share of Senior Credit Other Secured Wholly Owned Joint Consolidated Joint Total Total Debt Facilities(1) Debt Debt Debt Venture Debt Debt Venture Debt Debt Debt 2011 $ 69,000 $ 129,443 $ — $ 15,499 $ 213,942 $ 139,410 $ 353,352 $ 414,907 $ 768,259 $ 395,844 2012 — — 153,903 29,636 183,539 468,361 651,900 434,468 1,086,368 478,649 2013 293,897 — — 23,366 317,263 103,568 420,831 732,130 1,152,961 547,092 2014 — 139,490 — 4,904 144,394 8,809 153,203 556,096 709,299 357,254 2015 112,491 — 205,773 7,908 326,172 16,943 343,115 464,706 807,821 504,984 2016 250,000 — — 81,936 331,936 15,499 347,435 170,709 518,144 397,384 2017 300,000 — — 67,913 367,913 490 368,403 92,414 460,817 388,927 2018 300,000 — — — 300,000 595 300,595 96,694 397,289 334,094 2019 250,000 — — — 250,000 28,713 278,713 11,778 290,491 270,707 2020 123,213 — — — 123,213 645 123,858 211,643 335,501 197,459 Thereafter — — — — — 2,450 2,450 377,455 379,905 133,164 Subtotal $ 1,698,601 $ 268,933 $ 359,676 $ 231,162 $ 2,558,372 $ 785,483 $ 3,343,855 $ 3,563,000 $ 6,906,855 $ 4,005,558 Unamortized net (discounts) premiums (12,645 ) — — 43 (12,602 ) 46 (12,556 ) (4,580 ) (17,136 ) (15,995 ) Subtotal $ 1,685,956 $ 268,933 $ 359,676 $ 231,205 $ 2,545,770 $ 785,529 $ 3,331,299 $ 3,558,420 $ 6,889,719 $ 3,989,563 Joint venture partners’ share of debt — — — — — (451,335 ) (451,335 ) (2,448,821 ) (2,900,156 ) — Operating partnership’s share of total debt(2) $ 1,685,956 $ 268,933 $ 359,676 $ 231,205 $ 2,545,770 $ 334,194 $ 2,879,964 $ 1,109,599 $ 3,989,563 $ 3,989,563 Weighted average interest rate 5.6 % 1.7 % 3.0 % 2.9 % 4.6 % 4.8 % 4.6 % 4.6 % 4.6 % 4.6 % Weighted average maturity (years) 6.1 1.9 3.6 4.9 5.2 1.9 4.4 4.4 4.4 4.8 (1) Represents three credit facilities with total capacity of approximately $1.7 billion.

(2) Operating partnership’s share of total debt represents the operating partnership’s pro rata portion of the total debt based on the operating partnership’s percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated or unconsolidated joint ventures holding the debt. The operating partnership believes that operating partnership’s share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze its leverage and to compare its leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of the operating partnership’s debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Operating partnership’s share of total debt is not intended to reflect the operating partnership’s actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the co-investment ventures. The above table reconciles operating partnership’s share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure. 86 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2010, the operating partnership had debt maturing in 2011 through 2014, assuming extension options are exercised, as follows (dollars in thousands): After Extension Options(1)(2) 2011 2012 2013 2014 Wholly owned debt Unsecured Senior Debt $ 69,000 $ — $ 293,897 $ — Credit Facilities — 129,443 — — Other Debt — 153,903 — — Operating Partnership Secured Debt 14,300 28,068 22,090 — Subtotal 83,300 311,414 315,987 — Consolidated Joint Ventures AMB-AMS, L.P. — — 39,273 — AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P. — 3,850 199,972 4,590 AMB-SGP, L.P. 38,176 289,125 — — Other Industrial Operating Joint Ventures 53,311 30,972 20,355 4,344 Subtotal 91,487 323,947 259,600 8,934 Unconsolidated Joint Ventures AMB-SGP Mexico 58,825 163,769 — — AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. 151,511 212,617 493,566 — AMB-Europe Logistics Fund, FCP-FIS — — — 412,234 AMB U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P. 30,310 29,397 181,457 117,995 Other Industrial Operating Joint Ventures 31,081 — 57,299 30,861 Subtotal 271,727 405,783 732,322 561,090 Total Consolidated 174,787 635,361 575,587 8,934 Total Unconsolidated 271,727 405,783 732,322 561,090 Total $ 446,514 $ 1,041,144 $ 1,307,909 $ 570,024 Total Operating Partnership’s Share(3) $ 201,771 $ 563,687 $ 580,546 $ 215,449 (1) Excludes scheduled principal amortization of debt maturing in years subsequent to 2014, as well as debt premiums and discounts.

The definition of “operating partnership’s share of total market capitalization” is the operating partnership’s share of total debt plus preferred equity liquidation preferences plus market capital. The operating partnership’s definition of “market capital” is the total number of outstanding common general partnership units of the operating partnership and common limited partnership units of AMB Property II, L.P. multiplied by the closing price per share of the parent company’s common stock as of December 31, 2010. The definition of “preferred” is preferred equity liquidation preferences. “Operating partnership’s share of total debt” is the operating partnership’s pro rata portion of the total debt based on its percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures holding the debt. “Operating partnership’s share of total assets” is the operating partnership’s pro rata portion of the gross book value of real estate interests plus cash and other assets. As of December 31, 2010, the operating partnership’s share of total assets was $9.3 billion. The operating partnership believes that operating partnership’s share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze its leverage and to compare its leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of the operating partnership’s debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Operating partnership’s share of total debt is not intended to reflect the operating partnership’s actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. For a reconciliation of operating partnership’s share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure, please see the table of debt maturities and capitalization above. 88 Table of Contents Liquidity of the Operating Partnership As of December 31, 2010, the operating partnership had $198.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $30.0 million in restricted cash. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the operating partnership increased the availability under its lines of credit by approximately $224 million while increasing its share of outstanding debt by approximately $409 million. As of December 31, 2010, the operating partnership had $1.4 billion available for future borrowings under its three multi-currency lines of credit, representing line utilization of 17%. The operating partnership’s available cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in its operating accounts. The invested cash is invested in money market funds that invest solely in direct obligations of the government of the United States or in time deposits with certain financial institutions. To date, the operating partnership has experienced no loss or lack of access to its invested cash or cash equivalents; however, the operating partnership can provide no assurances that access to its invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. At any point in time, the operating partnership also has a significant amount of cash deposits in its operating accounts that are with third party financial institutions, which was, as of December 31, 2010, approximately $171.3 million on a consolidated basis. These balances exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. While the operating partnership monitors daily the cash balances in its operating accounts and adjusts the cash balances as appropriate, these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets. To date, the operating partnership has experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in its operating accounts. The following table sets forth the operating partnership’s distributions paid or payable per unit for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: Paying Entity Security 2010 2009 2008 AMB Property, L.P.

Series D preferred units(1) $ — $ 2.69 $ 3.59 (1) On November 10, 2009, the parent company purchased all 1,595,337 outstanding series D preferred units of AMB Property II, L.P. in exchange for 2,880,281 shares of its common stock at a discount of $9.8 million. The operating partnership issued 2,880,281 general partnership units to the parent company in exchange for the 1,595,337 series D preferred units the parent company purchased. The operating partnership anticipates that it will be required to use proceeds from debt and equity financings and the divestitures of properties, in addition to cash from its operations, to make its distribution payments and repay its maturing debt as it comes due. However, the operating partnership may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. The operating partnership’s inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay cash distributions to its unitholders and make payments to its noteholders. The operating partnership is currently exploring various options to monetize its development assets including contribution to funds where investment capacity is available, the formation of joint ventures and the sale of assets to third parties. The operating partnership is also exploring the potential sale of operating assets to further enhance liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that the operating partnership will choose to or be able to monetize any of its assets. Cash flows generated by the operating partnership’s business were sufficient to cover its distributions for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, including its distributions to the parent company, which are, in turn, paid to the parent company’s stockholders as dividends and distributions. Cash flows from the operating partnership’s real estate operations and private capital businesses, which are included in “Net cash provided by 89 Table of Contents operating activities” in its Cash Flows from Operating Activities and cash flows from its real estate development and operations businesses which are included in “Net proceeds from divestiture of real estate and securities” in its Cash Flows from Investing Activities in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, were sufficient to pay distributions on common and preferred limited partnership units of the operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. and distributions to noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. The operating partnership uses proceeds from its businesses included in Cash Flows from Investing Activities (specifically, the proceeds from sales and contributions of properties as part of its real estate development and operations businesses) to fund distributions not covered by Cash Flows from Operating Activities. The following table sets forth the summary of the operating partnership’s distributions paid or payable for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: For the Years Ended December 31, Summary of Distributions Paid 2010 2009 2008 (dollars in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 252,760 $ 243,113 $ 302,614 Distributions paid to partners (195,755 ) (139,515 ) (224,549 ) Distributions to noncontrolling interests, including preferred units (11,047 ) (18,771 ) (61,934 ) Excess of net cash provided by operating activities over distributions paid $ 45,958 $ 84,827 $ 16,131 Net proceeds from divestiture of real estate $ 101,660 $ 482,515 $ 421,647 Excess of net cash provided by operating activities and net proceeds from divestiture of real estate over distributions paid $ 147,618 $ 567,342 $ 437,778 Capital Commitments of the Operating Partnership Development starts, generally defined as projects where the operating partnership has obtained building permits and has begun physical construction, during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 on an owned and managed basis were as follows, excluding value-added acquisitions (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 The Americas: Number of new development projects 4 — Square feet 860,497 — Estimated total investment(1) $ 68,146 $ — Asia: Number of new development projects 3 — Square feet 755,752 — Estimated total investment(1) $ 34,718 $ — Total: Number of new development projects 7 — Square feet 1,616,249 — Estimated total investment(1) $ 102,864 $ — Total construction-in-progress estimated investment(1)(2) $ 170,751 $ — Total construction-in-progress invested to date(3) $ 107,274 $ — Total construction-in-progress remaining to invest(3)(4) $ 63,477 $ — (1) Includes total estimated cost of development, renovation, or expansion, including initial acquisition costs, prepaid ground leases, buildings, and associated carry costs.

(4) Calculated using estimated total investment before the impact of real estate impairment losses. Development Portfolio. As of December 31, 2010, the operating partnership had eight construction-in-progress development projects, on an owned and managed basis, which are expected to total approximately 2.2 million square feet and have an aggregate estimated investment of $169.8 million upon completion, net of $1.0 million of cumulative real estate impairment losses to date. Four of these projects totaling approximately 1.2 million square feet with an aggregate estimated investment of $124.2 million were held in an unconsolidated co-investment venture. Construction-in-progress, at December 31, 2010, included projects expected to be completed through the third quarter of 2012. On an owned and managed basis, the operating partnership had an additional 25 development projects available for sale or contribution totaling approximately 6.8 million square feet, with an aggregate estimated investment of $700.0 million, net of $67.6 million of cumulative real estate impairment losses to date, and an aggregate net book value of $680.6 million. As of December 31, 2010, on an owned and managed basis, the operating partnership and its development joint venture partners have funded an aggregate of $855.5 million, or 91%, of the total estimated investment before the impact of real estate investment losses and will need to fund an estimated additional $82.9 million, or 9%, in order to complete its development portfolio. In addition to its committed development pipeline, the operating partnership held a total of 2,641 acres of land for future development or sale, on an owned and managed basis, approximately 87% of which was located in the Americas. This included 254 acres that were held in unconsolidated joint ventures. The operating partnership currently estimates that these 2,641 acres of land could support approximately 47.4 million square feet of future development. Lease Commitments. The operating partnership has entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on-tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from 1 to 79 years. These buildings and improvements subject to ground leases are amortized ratably over the lesser of the terms of the related leases or 40 years. Future minimum rental payments required under non-cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2010 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2011 $ 36,278 2012 33,412 2013 30,387 2014 28,724 2015 27,357 Thereafter 414,203 Total $ 570,361 Co-Investment Ventures. The operating partnership enters into co-investment ventures with institutional investors, acting as the general partner or manager of such ventures. These co-investment ventures are managed by the operating partnership’s private capital group and provide the company with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2010, the operating partnership had investments in co-investment ventures with a gross book value of approximately $1.1 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and net equity investments in unconsolidated co-investment ventures of $732.7 million and a gross book value of approximately $7.1 billion. In the year ended December 31, 2010, the operating partnership made a $200.0 million investment in AMB U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P. and a $100.0 million investment in AMB Europe Logistics Fund, FCP-FIS. Additionally, third party investors contributed $257.0 million to AMB U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P. and $55.3 million in AMB 91 Table of Contents Europe Logistics Fund, FCP-FIS during the year ended December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, the operating partnership may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co-investment ventures of up to $286.4 million pursuant to the terms of the co-investment venture agreements. From time to time, the operating partnership may raise additional equity commitments for AMB U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P., an open-ended unconsolidated co-investment venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, most of whom invest through a private real estate investment trust, and for AMB Europe Logistics Fund, FCP-FIS, an open-ended unconsolidated co-investment venture formed in 2007 with institutional investors. This could increase the operating partnership’s obligation to make additional capital commitments to these ventures. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of AMB U.S. Logistics Fund, L.P., and the management regulations of AMB Europe Logistics Fund, FCP-FIS, the operating partnership is obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments until such time when its total equity commitment is greater than $150.0 million or 150.0 million Euros, respectively, at which time, its obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. The operating partnership expects to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under its credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely affect its cash flow. On December 22, 2010, the company announced the formation of AMB Brazil Logistics Partners Fund I, L.P., a single-investor co-investment venture whose strategy is to develop, acquire, own, operate, manage and dispose of logistics properties primarily within the company’s target markets in Brazil, namely São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. This venture will invest through an equity interest in the joint venture previously established between the company and its local Brazil partner, Cyrela Commercial Properties. The initial third-party equity investment will be approximately 360.0 million Brazilian Reais (approximately $216.9 million in U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2010) and the joint venture’s overall equity commitment is 720.0 million Brazilian Reais (approximately $433.8 million in U.S. dollars using the same exchange rate), including the company’s 50 percent co-investment. In addition, on August 2, 2010, the company announced the formation of AMB Mexico Fondo Logistico, a publicly traded co-investment venture with a 10-year term whose investment strategy is to develop, acquire, own, operate and manage industrial distribution facilities primarily within the company’s target markets in Mexico. Approximately 3.3 billion Pesos was raised from the third party investors in the venture, comprised of institutional investors in Mexico, primarily private pension plans. These contributions, net of offering costs, held partially in Pesos and U.S. dollars, totaled approximately $252.2 million using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2010. The company will contribute 20% of the total equity, or approximately $63.1 million, at full deployment, for total equity of $315.3 million available for future investments. As of December 31, 2010, no investments had been made in real estate properties within this co-investment venture. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, the operating partnership formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd. (Arcata), which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the attachment point of the operating partnership’s third-party insurance policies. The captive insurance company is one element of the operating partnership’s overall risk management program. The company capitalized Arcata in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata establishes annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of the operating partnership’s properties. Like premiums paid to third-party insurance companies, premiums paid to Arcata may be reimbursed by customers pursuant to specific lease terms. Through this structure, the operating partnership believes that it has more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Contingent and Unknown Liabilities. Contingent and unknown liabilities may include the following: • liabilities for environmental conditions; • losses in excess of insured coverage; • claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with the company’s predecessors prior to the company’s formation or acquisition transactions that had not been asserted or were unknown prior to the operating partnership’s formation or acquisition transactions; 92 Table of Contents • claims for indemnification by the general partners, officers and directors and others indemnified by the former owners of the operating partnership’s properties; • accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and • tax, legal and regulatory liabilities.

As of December 31, 2010, the company had provided approximately $12.9 million in letters of credit, of which $10.4 million were provided under the operating partnership’s $600.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees and Contribution Obligations. Excluding parent guarantees associated with debt or contribution obligations as discussed in Part I, Item 1, Notes 5, 6 and 12 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” as of December 31, 2010, the company had outstanding guarantees and contribution obligations in the aggregate amount of $403.0 million as described below. As of December 31, 2010, the company had outstanding bank guarantees in the amount of $0.3 million used to secure contingent obligations, primarily obligations under development and purchase agreements. As of December 31, 2010, the company also guaranteed $58.6 million and $83.5 million on outstanding loans on five of its consolidated joint ventures and three of its unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively. Also, the company has entered into contribution agreements with certain of its unconsolidated co-investment ventures. These contribution agreements require the company to make additional capital contributions to the applicable co-investment venture fund upon certain defaults by the co-investment venture of certain of its debt obligations to the lenders. Such additional capital contributions will cover all or part of the applicable co-investment venture’s debt obligation and may be greater than the company’s share of the co-investment venture’s debt obligation or the value of the company’s share of any property securing such debt. The company’s contribution obligations under these agreements will be reduced by the amounts recovered by the lender and the fair market value of the property, if any, used to secure the debt and obtained by the lender upon default. The company’s potential obligations under these contribution agreements totaled $260.6 million as of December 31, 2010. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2010, the company had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $3.8 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of the company’s development projects and were posted to guarantee certain property tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the property taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promote Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, the company may be obligated to make payments to certain of its joint venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with the company. From time to time in the normal course of its business, the company enters into various contracts with third parties that may obligate the company to make payments, pay promotes, or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES Funds From Operations, as adjusted (“FFO, as adjusted”) and Funds From Operations Per Share and Unit, as adjusted (“FFOPS, as adjusted”) The company believes that net income, as defined by U.S. GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, the company considers funds from operations, as adjusted (or FFO, as adjusted), FFO per share and unit, as adjusted (or FFOPS, as adjusted), Core FFO, as adjusted and Core FFO per share and unit, as adjusted (or Core FFOPS, as adjusted) to be useful supplemental measures of its operating performance. The company defines FFOPS, as adjusted, as FFO, as adjusted, per fully diluted weighted average share of the parent company’s common stock and operating partnership units. The company calculates FFO, as adjusted, as net income (or loss) available to common stockholders, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate-related depreciation, and adjustments to derive the company’s pro rata share of FFO, as adjusted of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. The company defines Core FFOPS, as adjusted as Core FFO, as adjusted per fully diluted weighted share of the parent company’s common stock and operating partnership units. The company calculates Core FFO, as adjusted as FFO, as adjusted excluding 95 Table of Contents the company’s share of development profits. These calculations also include adjustments for items as described below. Unless stated otherwise, the company includes the gains from development, including those from value-added conversion projects, before depreciation recapture, as a component of FFO, as adjusted. The company believes gains from development should be included in FFO, as adjusted, to more completely reflect the performance of one of its lines of business. The company believes that value-added conversion dispositions are in substance land sales and as such should be included in FFO, as adjusted, consistent with the real estate investment trust industry’s long standing practice to include gains on the sale of land in funds from operations. However, the company’s interpretation of FFO, as adjusted, or FFOPS, as adjusted, may not be consistent with the views of others in the real estate investment trust industry, who may consider it to be a divergence from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) definition, and may not be comparable to funds from operations or funds from operations per share and unit reported by other real estate investment trusts that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than the company does. In connection with the formation of a joint venture, the company may warehouse assets that are acquired with the intent to contribute these assets to the newly formed venture. Some of the properties held for contribution may, under certain circumstances, be required to be depreciated under U.S. GAAP. If this circumstance arises, the company intends to include in its calculation of FFO, as adjusted, gains or losses related to the contribution of previously depreciated real estate to joint ventures. Although such a change, if instituted, will be a departure from the current NAREIT definition, the company believes such calculation of FFO, as adjusted, will better reflect the value created as a result of the contributions. To date, the company has not included gains or losses from the contribution of previously depreciated warehoused assets in FFO, as adjusted. In addition, the company calculates FFO, as adjusted, to exclude impairment and restructuring charges, debt extinguishment losses and the Series D preferred unit redemption discount. The impairment charges were principally a result of increases in estimated capitalization rates and deterioration in market conditions that adversely impacted values. The restructuring charges reflected costs associated with the company’s reduction in global headcount and cost structure. Debt extinguishment losses generally included the costs of repurchasing debt securities. The company repurchased certain tranches of senior unsecured debt to manage its debt maturities in response to the current financing environment, resulting in greater debt extinguishment costs. The Series D preferred unit redemption discount reflects the gain associated with the discount to liquidation preference in the Series D preferred unit redemption price less costs incurred as a result of the redemption. In 2008, the company also recognized charges to write-off pursuit costs related to development projects it no longer planned to commence and to establish a reserve against tax assets associated with the reduction of its development activities. Although difficult to predict, these items may be recurring given the uncertainty of the current economic climate and its adverse effects on the real estate and financial markets. While not infrequent or unusual in nature, these items result from market fluctuations that can have inconsistent effects on the company’s results of operations. The economics underlying these items reflect market and financing conditions in the short-term but can obscure the company’s performance and the value of the company’s long-term investment decisions and strategies. Management believes FFO, as adjusted, is significant and useful to both it and its investors. FFO, as adjusted, more appropriately reflects the value and strength of the company’s business model and its potential performance isolated from the volatility of the current economic environment and unobscured by costs (or gains) resulting from the company’s management of its financing profile in response to the tightening of the capital markets. However, in addition to the limitations of FFO Measures, as adjusted, generally discussed below, FFO, as adjusted, does not present a comprehensive measure of the company’s financial condition and operating performance. This measure is a modification of the NAREIT definition of funds from operations and should not be used as an alternative to net income or cash as defined by U.S. GAAP. The company believes that the FFO Measures, as adjusted, are meaningful supplemental measures of its operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, the FFO Measures, as adjusted, 96 Table of Contents are supplemental measures of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that exclude historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income available to common stockholders, as defined by U.S. GAAP. The company believes that the use of the FFO Measures, as adjusted, combined with the required U.S. GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. The company considers the FFO Measures, as adjusted, to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, the FFO Measures, as adjusted, can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While funds from operations and funds from operations per share are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, the FFO Measures, as adjusted, do not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating the company’s liquidity or operating performance. The FFO Measures, as adjusted, also do not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to the company’s real estate assets nor are the FFO Measures, as adjusted, necessarily indicative of cash available to fund the company’s future cash requirements. Management compensates for the limitations of the FFO Measures, as adjusted, by providing investors with financial statements prepared according to U.S. GAAP, along with this detailed discussion of the FFO Measures, as adjusted, and a reconciliation of the FFO Measures, as adjusted, to net income available to common stockholders, a U.S. GAAP measurement. 97 Table of Contents The following table reflects the calculation of FFO, as adjusted, reconciled from net income (loss) available to common unitholders of the operating partnership and common stockholders of the parent company for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts): For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Net income (loss) available to common unitholders of the operating partnership $ 10,122 $ (50,866 ) $ (67,233 ) Net income (loss) available to common unitholders of the operating partnership attributable to limited partners of the operating partnership (155 ) 789 782 Net income (loss) available to common stockholders of the parent company 9,967 (50,077 ) (66,451 ) Gains from sale or contribution of real estate interests, net (20,248 ) (38,718 ) (22,561 ) Depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 196,636 175,334 161,000 Discontinued operations’ depreciation 3,447 6,602 8,199 Non-real estate depreciation (8,432 ) (8,593 ) (7,270 ) Adjustment for depreciation on development profits (1,546 ) — — Adjustments to derive FFO, as adjusted, from consolidated joint ventures: Joint venture partners’ noncontrolling interests (Net loss) 6,278 11,063 32,855 Limited partnership unitholders’ noncontrolling interests (Net loss (income)) 88 (3,625 ) (5,063 ) Limited partnership unitholders’ noncontrolling interests (Development profits) 133 2,377 2,822 FFO, as adjusted, attributable to noncontrolling interests (28,251 ) (31,571 ) (50,381 ) Adjustments to derive FFO, as adjusted, from unconsolidated joint ventures: The company’s share of net (income) loss (17,372 ) (11,331 ) (17,121 ) The company’s share of FFO, as adjusted 61,903 47,549 44,589 Adjustments for impairments, restructuring charges and debt extinguishment: Real estate impairment losses — 172,059 182,866 Discontinued operations’ real estate impairment losses — 9,794 11,052 Pursuit costs and tax reserve — — 11,834 Restructuring charges 4,874 6,368 12,306 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 2,892 12,267 786 Preferred unit redemption discount — (9,759 ) — Allocation to participating securities(1) (182 ) (898 ) (1,186 ) Funds from operations, as adjusted $ 210,187 $ 288,841 $ 298,276 Basic FFO, as adjusted, per common share and unit $ 1.27 $ 2.10 $ 2.95 Diluted FFO, as adjusted, per common share and unit $ 1.27 $ 2.09 $ 2.90 Weighted average common shares and units: Basic 165,273,488 137,740,825 101,253,972 Diluted 166,126,934 137,903,929 102,734,827 Core Funds From Operations, as adjusted Funds from operations, as adjusted $ 210,187 $ 288,841 $ 298,276 Development profits, net of taxes (6,739 ) (88,876 ) (81,084 ) Joint venture partners’ and limited partnership unitholders’ share of development profits, net of taxes 61 3,308 9,041 Limited partnership unitholders’ noncontrolling interests (Development profits) (133 ) (2,377 ) (2,822 ) AMB’s share of development profits from unconsolidated joint ventures (9 ) (271 ) (2,071 ) Allocation to participating securities(1) 49 585 645 Core Funds From Operations, as adjusted(1) $ 203,416 $ 201,210 $ 221,985 Basic Core FFO, as adjusted per common share and unit (diluted) $ 1.23 $ 1.46 $ 2.19 Diluted Core FFO, as adjusted per common share and unit (diluted) $ 1.22 $ 1.46 $ 2.16 Weighted average common shares and units: Basic 165,273,488 137,740,825 101,253,972 Diluted 166,126,934 137,903,929 102,734,827 (1) To be consistent with the company’s policies of determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities and accounting for earnings per share, the FFO, as adjusted, per common share and unit is adjusted for FFO, as adjusted, distributed through declared dividends and 98 Table of Contents allocated to all participating securities (weighted average common shares and units outstanding and unvested restricted shares outstanding) under the two-class method. Under this method, allocations were made to 1,202,122, 918,753 and 855,919 unvested restricted shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Same Store Net Operating Income (“SS NOI”) The company defines NOI as rental revenues, including reimbursements, less property operating expenses. NOI excludes depreciation, amortization, general and administrative expenses, restructuring charges, real estate impairment losses, development profits (losses), gains (losses) from sale or contribution of real estate interests, and interest expense. The company believes that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, NOI is a useful supplemental measure calculated to help investors understand the company’s operating performance, excluding the effects of gains (losses), costs and expenses which are not related to the performance of the assets. NOI is widely used by the real estate industry as a useful supplemental measure, which helps investors compare the company’s operating performance with that of other companies. Real estate impairment losses have been excluded in deriving NOI because the company does not consider its impairment losses to be a property operating expense. The company believes that the exclusion of impairment losses from NOI is a common methodology used in the real estate industry. Real estate impairment losses relate to the changing values of the company’s assets but do not reflect the current operating performance of the assets with respect to their revenues or expenses. The company’s real estate impairment losses are non-cash charges which represent the write down in the value of assets when estimated fair value over the holding period is lower than current carrying value. The impairment charges were principally a result of increases in estimated capitalization rates and deterioration in market conditions that adversely impacted underlying real estate values. Therefore, the impairment charges are not related to the current performance of the company’s real estate operations and should be excluded from its calculation of NOI. The company considers SS NOI to be a useful supplemental measure of its operating performance for properties that are considered part of the same store pool. The company defines Cash-basis SS NOI as NOI on a same store basis excluding straight line rents and amortization of lease intangibles. The same store pool includes all properties that are owned as of the end of both the current and prior year reporting periods and excludes development properties for both the current and prior reporting periods. The same store pool is set annually and excludes properties purchased and development stabilized after December 31, 2008. The company considers SS NOI to be an appropriate and useful supplemental performance measure because it reflects the operating performance of the real estate portfolio excluding effects of non-cash adjustments and provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year-over-year comparison. In addition, the company believes that SS NOI helps investors compare the operating performance of its real estate as compared to other companies. While SS NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating the company’s liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI also does not reflect general and administrative expenses, interest expenses, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact the company’s results from operations. Further, the company’s computation of SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating SS NOI. 99 Table of Contents The following table reconciles SS NOI, cash-basis SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI, excluding lease termination fees from net loss for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Net income (loss) $ 33,594 $ (27,960 ) $ (6,750 ) Private capital revenues (30,860 ) (38,013 ) (68,472 ) Depreciation and amortization 196,636 175,334 161,000 Real estate impairment losses — 172,059 182,866 General and administrative and fund costs 125,155 116,404 145,040 Restructuring charges 4,874 6,368 12,306 Total other income and expenses 108,773 89,170 20,509 Total discontinued operations (24,242 ) (96,222 ) (11,169 ) Net operating income 413,930 397,140 435,330 Less non same-store NOI (73,535 ) (47,582 ) (26,626 ) Less non-cash adjustments(1) (9,045 ) (2,803 ) (5,457 ) Cash-basis same-store NOI $ 331,350 $ 346,755 $ 403,247 Less lease termination fees (3,059 ) (2,692 ) (5,518 ) Cash-basis same-store NOI, excluding lease termination fees $ 328,291 $ 344,063 $ 397,729 (1) Non-cash adjustments include straight-line rents and amortization of lease intangibles for the same store pool only. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. The company’s future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, the company manages its market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, payments to noteholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of the company’s outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimize the risk of fluctuating interest rates. The company’s exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with its credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and its ability to incur more debt without stockholder and unitholder approval, thereby increasing its debt service obligations, which could adversely affect its cash flows. The table below summarizes the maturities and interest rates associated with the company’s fixed and variable rate debt outstanding at book value and estimated fair value before unamortized net discounts of $12.6 million as of December 31, 2010 (dollars in thousands): 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Fair Value Fixed rate debt(1) $ 143,598 $ 544,574 $ 365,635 $ 13,713 $ 137,342 $ 1,393,341 $ 2,598,203 $ 2,672,107 Average interest rate 6.5 % 5.1 % 6.1 % 5.3 % 5.1 % 5.1 % 5.3 % n/a Variable rate debt(2) $ 209,754 $ 107,326 $ 55,196 $ 139,490 $ 205,773 $ 28,113 $ 745,652 $ 742,076 Average interest rate 2.1 % 1.8 % 2.9 % 1.7 % 2.8 % 2.0 % 2.2 % n/a Interest payments(3) $ 13,630 $ 29,611 $ 23,763 $ 3,037 $ 12,661 $ 71,778 $ 154,480 n/a (1) Represents 77.7% of all outstanding debt at December 31, 2010. (2) Represents 22.3% of all outstanding debt at December 31, 2010. (3) Represents interest expense related only to the debt balances maturing in each respective year, based upon interest rates at the balance sheet date. 100 Table of Contents If market rates of interest on the company’s variable rate debt increased or decreased by 10%, then the increase or decrease in interest cost on the company’s variable rate debt would be $1.6 million (net of the swap) annually. As of December 31, 2010, the book value and the estimated fair value of the company’s total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) were $3.3 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, based on the company’s estimate of current market interest rates. As of December 31, 2009, the book value and the estimated fair value of the company’s total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) both were $3.2 billion, based on our estimate of current market interest rates. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, variable rate debt comprised 22.3% and 38.8%, respectively, of all the company’s outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $0.7 billion and $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. Financial Instruments. The company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability. For derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges, the offset to this entry is to accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders’ equity for the parent company, partners’ capital for the operating partnership or income for any ineffectiveness. For derivatives which do not qualify as cash flow hedges, the offset to the change in fair value on the derivative asset or liability is recorded directly in earnings as gains or losses through other income (expenses). For revenues or expenses denominated in non-functional currencies, the company may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. The company’s derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2010 were 24 interest rate swaps and one interest rate cap hedging cash flows of variable rate borrowings based on U.S. LIBOR and four foreign exchange forward contracts hedging intercompany loans. The company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.

The company’s exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the company’s subsidiaries operating in the United States, Mexico and certain subsidiaries in Europe. The functional currency for the company’s subsidiaries operating outside the United States, other than Mexico and certain subsidiaries in Europe, is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity or property is located, mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses. The company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. The company translates income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The gains (losses) resulting from the translation are 102 Table of Contents included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders’ equity for the parent company or partners’ capital for the operating partnership and totaled $36.7 million and $(22.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The company’s international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non-monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. The company also records gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, total unrealized and realized gains (losses) from remeasurement and translation included in the company’s results of operations were $1.4 million, $(7.2) million and $(5.7) million, respectively.",2023-12-30 18:37:14.416678
1045609,PLD,"Prologis, Inc.",2006,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements. We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company effective with the completion of our initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with our initial tax return for the year ended December 31, 1997. AMB Property Corporation and AMB Property, L.P. were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering. Management’s Overview The primary source of our revenue and earnings is rent received from customers under long-term (generally three to ten years) operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs, and from partnership distributions and fees from our private capital business. We also produce earnings from the strategic disposition of operating assets, from the disposition of projects in our development-for-sale or contribution program and from contributions of properties to our co-investment joint ventures. Our long-term growth is driven by our ability to maintain and increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties, and by our ability to continue to acquire and develop new properties. National industrial markets improved during 2005 when compared with market conditions in 2004. According to Torto Wheaton Research, the positive trend in demand began in the second quarter of 2004 and reversed 14 prior quarters of negatively trending, or rising, space availability. We believe the protracted period of rising availability created a difficult national leasing environment which is now improving, particularly in large industrial property markets tied to global trade. During the three-and-a-half year period of negatively trending industrial space availability, investor demand for industrial property (as supported by our observation of strong national sales volumes and declining acquisition capitalization rates) remained consistently strong. We believe we capitalized on the demand for acquisition property by accelerating the repositioning of our portfolio through the disposition of non-core properties. We plan to continue selling selected assets on an opportunistic basis but believe we have substantially achieved our repositioning goals. U.S. Hub and Total Other Total/Weighted Property Data Gateway Markets(1) Markets(2) Average For the year ended December 31, 2005: % of total rentable square feet 74.9 % 25.1 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 96.2 % 94.6 % 95.8 % Same space square footage leased 11,032,482 2,574,944 13,607,426 Rent decreases on renewals and rollovers (10.8 )% (4.3 )% (9.7 )% For the year ended December 31, 2004: % of total rentable square feet 74.1 % 25.9 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 95.0 % 94.2 % 94.8 % Same space square footage leased 13,932,213 3,553,563 17,485,776 Rent decreases on renewals and rollovers (15.3 )% (3.6 )% (13.2 )% (1) Our U.S. hub and gateway markets include on-tarmac and Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas/ Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/ New York City, the San Francisco Bay Area, Miami and Seattle. (2) Our total other markets include other domestic target markets, other non-target markets, international target markets and retail. We observed two positive trends nationally for industrial real estate during the year ended December 31, 2005, supported by data provided by Torto Wheaton Research. First, national industrial space availability 39 Table of Contents declined 130 basis points during the year from 10.9% to 9.6%. The availability rate has fallen for seven consecutive quarters, reversing the trend of the prior 14 quarters in which national industrial space availability increased on average 36 basis points per quarter. Second, national absorption of industrial space, defined as the net change in occupied stock as measured by square feet of completions less the change in available square feet, totaled approximately 281 million square feet in the year ended December 31, 2005, substantially exceeding the 183 million square feet of space absorbed in 2004 and well above the previous ten-year historical average of 139 million square feet of space absorbed annually. In this improved environment, our industrial portfolio’s occupancy levels increased to 95.8% at December 31, 2005 from 94.8% at December 31, 2004, which we believe reflects higher levels of demand for industrial space generally and in our portfolio specifically. During the year ended December 31, 2005, our lease expirations totaled approximately 17.6 million square feet while commencements of new or renewed leases totaled approximately 21.3 million square feet, resulting in an increase in our occupancy level of approximately 100 basis points. Rental rates on industrial renewals and rollovers in our portfolio decreased 9.7% during the year ended December 31, 2005 as leases were entered into or renewed at rates consistent with what we believe to be current market levels. We believe this decline in rents on lease renewals and rollovers reflects trends in national industrial space availability. We believe that relatively high levels of national industrial space availability have caused market rents for industrial properties to decline between 10% and 20% from their peak levels in 2001 based on our research data; 42.5% of the space that rolled over in our portfolio in 2005 had commenced between 1999 and 2001. Rental rates in our portfolio declined at successively lower rates in each of the last three quarters during 2005, which we believe indicates a stabilization of market rental rate levels. While the level of rental rate reduction varied by market, we achieved occupancy levels in our portfolio 540 basis points in excess of the national industrial market, as determined by Torto Wheaton Research, by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions. During periods of decreasing or stabilizing rental rates, we strove to sign leases with shorter terms to prevent locking in lower rent levels for long periods and to be prepared to sign new, longer-term leases during periods of growing rental rates. When we sign leases of shorter duration, we attempt to limit overall leasing costs and capital expenditures by offering different grades of tenant improvement packages, appropriate to the lease term. We expect development to be a significant driver of our earnings growth as we expand our land and development pipeline, and contribute completed development projects into our co-investment program and recognize development profits. We believe that development, renovation and expansion of well-located, high-quality industrial properties should generally continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of existing properties. We believe that our development opportunities in Mexico and Japan are particularly attractive given the current lack of supply of modern industrial distribution facilities in the major metropolitan markets of these countries. Globally, we have increased our development pipeline from $106.8 million at the end of 2002 to approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2005. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 1,307 acres for future development or sale. We believe these 1,307 acres of land could support approximately 24.3 million square feet of future development. Going forward, we believe that our co-investment program with private-capital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for acquisitions. Through these co-investment joint ventures, we typically earn acquisition and development fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, as well as promoted interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the co-investment joint ventures; however, we can not assure you that we will continue to do so. Through contribution of development properties to our co-investment joint ventures, we expect to recognize value creation from our development pipeline. As of December 31, 2005, we owned approximately 54.8 million square feet of our properties (47.7% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these co-investment joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. 40 Table of Contents By the end of 2007, we plan to have approximately 15% of our operating portfolio (based on both consolidated and unconsolidated annualized base rent) invested in international markets. Our North American target markets outside of the United States currently include Guadalajara, Mexico City, Monterrey and Toronto. Our European target markets currently include Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, Hamburg, London, Lyon, Madrid, Milan and Paris. Our Asian target markets currently include Beijing, Busan, Nagoya, Osaka, the Pearl River Delta, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo. It is possible that our target markets will change over time to reflect experience, market opportunities, customer needs and changes in global distribution patterns. As of December 31, 2005, our international operating properties comprised 7.1% of our annualized base rents, including properties owned by our unconsolidated joint ventures. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our on-going operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can. We must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital. Summary of Key Transactions in 2005 During the year ended December 31, 2005, we completed the following significant capital deployment transactions: • Acquired 41 buildings in North America, Europe and Asia, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet, for $555.0 million, including two buildings that were acquired by two of our unconsolidated co-investment joint ventures; • Acquired an approximate 43% unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, one of Mexico’s largest real estate companies for $46.1 million; • Committed to 30 development projects in North America, Europe and Asia totaling 7.0 million square feet with an estimated total investment of approximately $522.4 million; • Acquired 341 acres of land for industrial warehouse development in North America, Europe and Asia for approximately $193.9 million; • Sold five land parcels and five development projects available for sale, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet, for an aggregate price of approximately $155.2 million; and • Divested ourselves of 142 industrial buildings and one retail center aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of approximately $926.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi-investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on-tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. We also received a net incentive distribution of approximately $26.4 million in cash. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 3 and 4 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a more detailed discussion of our acquisition, development and disposition activity. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we completed the following significant capital markets and other financing transactions: • Formed an unconsolidated co-investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., with planned investment of capacity of approximately 247.3 billion Yen ($2.1 billion U.S. dollars, using exchange rate at December 31, 2005). We contributed $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) of operating properties to the fund; • Contributed an industrial property for $23.6 million to AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, an unconsolidated co-investment joint venture; 41 Table of Contents • Obtained $69.7 million of debt (using exchange rates in effect at applicable quarter end dates) with a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% for international acquisitions; • Assumed $62.8 million of debt for our consolidated co-investment joint ventures at a weighted average interest rate of 7.4%; • Obtained long-term secured debt financings for our co-investment joint ventures of $139.7 million with a weighted average rate of 5.4%; • Exchanged $100.0 million of 6.9% Reset Put Securities for approximately $112.5 million of 5.094% Notes due 2015; • Raised $72.3 million in net proceeds from the issuance of $75.0 million of our 7.0% Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock; and • Issued $175.0 million of unsecured senior debt securities due 2010. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 6, 9 and 11 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. We also record at acquisition an intangible asset or liability for the value attributable to above or below-market leases, in-place leases and lease origination costs for all acquisitions. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property-by-property basis quarterly and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying amount of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future market conditions and the availability of capital. Examples of certain situations that could affect future cash flows of a property may include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in occupancy; unforeseen bankruptcy, lease termination and move-out of a major customer; or a significant decrease in annual base rents of that property. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying amount of our long-lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. Revenue Recognition. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an on-going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight-line rents, for doubtful accounts and 42 Table of Contents provide allowances as needed. We also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customer’s occupancy. Property Dispositions. We report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by third-party investors for cash. Second, we dispose of value-added conversion projects and build-to-suit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable. Lastly, beginning in 2002, SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, required us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met. Joint Ventures. We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We determine consolidation based on standards set forth in EITF 96-16, Investor’s Accounting for an Investee When the Investor Has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholder or Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto Rights, Statement of Position 78-9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures and FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities “FIN 46”. Based on the guidance set forth in these pronouncements, we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. For joint ventures that are variable interest entities as defined under FIN 46 where we are not the primary beneficiaries, we do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, but where we exercise significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. In June 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) issued EITF 04-5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights. Under this consensus, a sole general partner is presumed to control a limited partnership (or similar entity) and should consolidate that entity unless the limited partners possess kick-out rights or other substantive participating rights as described in EITF 96-16, Investor’s Accounting for an Investee When the Investor has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholder or Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto rights. As of June 29, 2005, this consensus was effective immediately for all new or modified agreements, and effective beginning in the first reporting period that ends after December 15, 2005 for all existing agreements. We adopted the consolidation requirements of this consensus in the third quarter 2005 for all new or modified agreements and will adopt the consensus for existing agreements in the first quarter of 2006. There was not a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon the adoption of the consolidation requirements of this consensus for all new or modified agreements. We do not believe that there will be a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, upon adopting the consensus for existing agreements. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the U.S. if we meet minimum distribution, income, asset and shareholder tests. However, some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable REIT subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as 43 Table of Contents depreciation and gain recognition. However, we believe deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. Same store properties are those that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development properties stabilized after December 31, 2003 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties for which we have held a certificate of occupancy or where building has been substantially complete for at least 12 months). As of December 31, 2005, same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 72.5 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. During 2005, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 150 buildings, aggregating approximately 10.6 million square feet. In 2004, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 29 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office, aggregating approximately 4.4 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results.

These decreases were partially offset by increased occupancy. Industrial same store occupancy was 95.6% at December 31, 2005 and 95.2% at December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, rents in the same store portfolio decreased 9.8% on industrial renewals and rollovers (cash basis) on 13.0 million square feet leased due to decreases in market rates. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The increase in private capital income of $31.0 million was primarily due to incentive distributions for 2005 of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, asset 44 Table of Contents management priority distributions from AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., and acquisition fees from AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.

The 2004 acquisitions consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The 2005 acquisitions consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial operating costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of $17.0 million in personnel costs related to additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions, and an increase of $1.5 million due to the expansion of satellite offices. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our consolidated co-investment joint ventures.

The increase in interest and other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income and a $1.0 million other fee. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our newly-formed unconsolidated co-investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. The 2004 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted from our contribution of $71.5 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co-investment joint venture, AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC. Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development-for-sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased volume in 2005. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after-tax gain of $1.9 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third-party co-investor for cash. During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our development-for-sale program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after-tax gain of $2.0 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third-party co-investor for cash.

Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi-investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on-tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. During 2004, we divested ourselves of 21 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office building, aggregating approximately 3.1 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $200.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.0 million.

The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares. 46 Table of Contents For the Years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 (dollars in millions) Revenues 2004 2003 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 514.1 $ 485.4 $ 28.7 5.9 % 2004 acquisitions 25.2 — 25.2 — % Development 6.2 6.9 (0.7 ) (10.1 )% Other industrial 7.7 4.4 3.3 75.0 % International industrial 25.2 6.1 19.1 313.1 % Retail 1.1 0.9 0.2 22.2 % Total rental revenues 579.5 503.7 75.8 15.0 % Private capital income 12.9 13.3 (0.4 ) (3.0 )% Total revenues $ 592.4 $ 517.0 $ 75.4 14.6 % The increase in U.S. industrial same store rental revenues was primarily driven by increased lease termination fees. Industrial same store occupancy was 95.2% at December 31, 2004 and 93.0% at December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, rents in the same store portfolio decreased 14.7% on industrial renewals and rollovers (cash basis) on 16.2 million square feet leased due to decreases in market rates. The properties acquired during 2003 consisted of 82 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2003 and 2004, we continued to acquire properties in France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The decrease in private capital income was due to greater incentive fees earned in the prior year.

The 2004 acquisitions consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2003 and 2004, we continued to acquire properties in France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial property operating costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The 2003 impairment loss was on investments in real estate and leasehold interests. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock-based compensation expense of $2.3 million and additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co-investment joint ventures. The increase in fund costs was due to additional formation of co-investment joint ventures in 2004.

This decrease was offset by the receipt of a lease termination fee at a property in Chicago in the first quarter of 2004. The gains from dispositions of real estate (not classified as discontinued operations) in 2004, resulted from our contribution of $71.5 million in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated co-investment joint venture, AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC. The gains from disposition of real estate (not classified as discontinued operations) in 2003, resulted from our contribution of $94.0 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co-investment joint venture, Industrial Fund I, LLC. Development profits represent gains from sales from our development-for-sale and contribution program. During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our development-for-sale program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also contributed one completed development project into a newly-formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after-tax gain of $2.0 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third-party co-investor for cash. During 2003, we sold seven development-for-sale and other projects, for an aggregate price of $74.8 million, with a resulting gain of $14.4 million, net of taxes. The increase in interest expense, including amortization, was due to the issuance of additional unsecured debt under our 2002 medium-term note program, increased borrowings on the unsecured credit facilities and additional secured debt borrowings in our co-investment joint ventures.

In addition, on November 26, 2003, the operating partnership redeemed all 1,300,000 of its outstanding 85/8% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Partnership Units and we recognized a reduction of income available to common stockholders of $1.7 million for the original issuance costs. In June and November 2003, we issued 2,000,000 shares of 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and 2,300,000 shares of 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, respectively. The timing of the newly issued shares contributed to the increase in preferred stock dividends. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, we use unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and common equity (issued by us and/or the operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our 100%-owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non-recourse, secured debt encumbering our 100%-owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes. In managing our co-investment joint ventures, in general, we use non-recourse, secured debt to capitalize our co-investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: • retained earnings and cash flow from operations; • borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities; • other forms of secured or unsecured financing; • proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries); • net proceeds from divestitures of properties; • private capital contributions from co-investment partners; and • net proceeds from contribution of properties and completed development projects to our co-investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will include: • working capital; • development, expansion and renovation of properties; • acquisitions, including our global expansion; • debt service; and • dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred stock and limited partnership units. 49 Table of Contents We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facilities and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Resources Dispositions of Real Estate Interests. During 2005, we recognized a gain of $1.3 million from disposition of real estate interests, representing the additional value received from the contribution of properties in 2004 to AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC. During 2005, we contributed $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties, consisting of six industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet, to our newly formed unconsolidated co-investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. We recognized a total gain of $17.8 million on the contribution, representing the partial sale of our interests in the contributed properties acquired by the third-party investors for cash. Property Divestitures. During 2005, we divested ourselves of 142 industrial buildings and one retail center, aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $926.6 million, with a resulting net gain of $113.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi-investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on-tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. We also received a net incentive distribution of approximately $26.4 million in cash which is classified under private capital income on the consolidated statement of operations. Development Sales and Contributions. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after-tax gain of $1.9 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third-party co-investor for cash. Properties Held for Contribution. As of December 31, 2005, we held for contribution to a co-investment joint venture one industrial building with an aggregate net book value of $32.8 million, which, when contributed to the joint venture, will reduce our current ownership interest from approximately 98% to an expected range of 20-50%. This asset is not being held for divestiture under SFAS No. 144. Properties Held for Divestiture. As of December 31, 2005, we held for divestiture five industrial buildings and one undeveloped land parcel, which are not in our core markets, do not meet our current strategic objectives or which we have included as part of our development-for-sale program. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. As of December 31, 2005, the net carrying value of the properties held for divestiture was $17.9 million. Expected net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the properties. Co-investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co-investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co-investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. We generally consolidate these joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because they are not variable interest entities and because we are the sole managing general partner and control all major operating decisions. However, in certain cases, our co-investment joint ventures are unconsolidated because we do not control all major operating decisions. Third-party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2005, we owned approximately 54.8 million square feet of our 50 Table of Contents properties (47.7% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so.

We have authorized for issuance 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which the following series were designated as of December 31, 2005: 1,595,337 shares of series D preferred; 220,440 shares of series E cumulative redeemable preferred; 267,439 shares of series F cumulative redeemable preferred of which 201,139 are outstanding; 840,000 shares of series H cumulative redeemable preferred; 510,000 shares of series I cumulative redeemable preferred; 800,000 shares of series J cumulative redeemable preferred; 800,000 shares of series K cumulative redeemable preferred; 2,300,000 shares of series L cumulative redeemable preferred, of which 2,000,000 are outstanding; 2,300,000 shares of series M cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding and 3,000,000 shares of series O cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding. 51 Table of Contents On December 13, 2005, we issued and sold 3,000,000 shares of 7.00% Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at $25.00 per share. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears at a rate per share equal to $1.75 per annum. The series O preferred stock is redeemable by us on or after December 13, 2010, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, if any, to the redemption date. We contributed the net proceeds of $72.3 million to the operating partnership, and in exchange, the operating partnership issued to us 3,000,000 7.00% Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. On June 23, 2003, we issued and sold 2,000,000 shares of 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at a price of $25.00 per share. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears at a rate per share equal to $1.625 per annum. The series L preferred stock is redeemable by us on or after June 23, 2008, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, if any, to the redemption date. We contributed the net proceeds of approximately $48.0 million to the operating partnership, and in exchange, the operating partnership issued to us 2,000,000 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. The operating partnership used the proceeds, in addition to proceeds previously contributed to the operating partnership from other equity issuances, to redeem all 3,995,800 of its 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units from us on July 28, 2003. We, in turn, used those proceeds to redeem all 3,995,800 of our 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $100.2 million, including all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, to the redemption date. On November 25, 2003, we issued and sold 2,300,000 shares of 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at $25.00 per share. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears at a rate per share equal to $1.6875 per annum. The series M preferred stock is redeemable by us on or after November 25, 2008, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends theron, if any, to the redemption date. We contributed the net proceeds of $55.4 million to the operating partnership, and in exchange, the operating partnership issued to us 2,300,000 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. On September 24, 2004, AMB Property II, L.P., a partnership in which Texas AMB I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and our indirect subsidiary, owns an approximate 1.0% general partnership interest and the operating partnership owns an approximate 99% common limited partnership interest, issued 729,582 5.0% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a price of $50.00 per unit. The series N preferred units were issued to Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. in exchange for the contribution of certain parcels of land that are located in multiple markets to AMB Property II, L.P. Effective January 27, 2006, Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. exercised its rights under its Put Agreement, dated September 24, 2004, with the operating partnership, and sold all of its series N preferred units to the operating partnership at a price equal to $50.00 per unit, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of such sale. Also on January 27, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of the series N preferred units from the operating partnership at a price equal to $50.00 per unit, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of such sale and cancelled all of the outstanding series N preferred units as of such date. As of December 31, 2005, $142.8 million in preferred units with a weighted average rate of 7.87%, issued by the operating partnership, were callable under the terms of the partnership agreement and $102.0 million in preferred units with a weighted average rate of 6.9% become callable in 2006. In December 2005, our board of directors approved a new two-year common stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. We did not repurchase or retire any shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2005. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend to operate with an our share of total debt-to-our share of total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2005, our share of total debt-to-our share of total market capitalization ratio was 34.7%. (See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for our definitions of “our share of total market capitalization,” “market equity” and “our share of total debt.”) However, we typically finance our consolidated co-investment joint ventures with secured debt at a loan-to- 52 Table of Contents value ratio of 50-65% per our joint venture partnership agreements. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2005, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.9 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $12.0 million. Of the $1.9 billion of secured debt, $1.4 billion is secured by properties in our joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non-recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 0.6% to 10.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 5.7%) and final maturity dates ranging from January 2006 to January 2025. As of December 31, 2005, $1.6 billion of the secured debt obligations bears interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3% while the remaining $291.7 million bears interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 2.1%). As of December 31, 2005, the operating partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $975.0 million in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.2% and had an average term of 5.2 years. These unsecured senior debt securities include $300.0 million in notes issued in June 1998, $250.0 million of medium-term notes, which were issued under the operating partnership’s 2000 medium-term note program, $325.0 million of medium-term notes, which were issued under the operating partnership’s 2002 medium-term note program, and approximately $112.5 million of 5.094% Notes Due 2015, which were issued to Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America on July 11, 2005 in a private placement, in exchange for the cancellation of $100 million of notes that were issued in June 1998 resulting in a discount of approximately $12.5 million. The unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various covenants. We guarantee the operating partnership’s obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. On June 1, 2004, the operating partnership completed the early renewal of its senior unsecured revolving line of credit in the amount of $500.0 million. We remain a guarantor of the operating partnership’s obligations under the credit facility. The three-year credit facility includes a multi-currency component under which up to $250.0 million can be drawn in Yen, Euros or British Pounds Sterling. The line, which matures in June 2007 and carries a one-year extension option, can be increased up to $700.0 million upon certain conditions, and replaces the operating partnership’s previous $500.0 million credit facility that was to mature in December 2005. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the operating partnership’s long-term debt rating, which is currently 60 basis points with an annual facility fee of 20 basis points, based on the current credit rating of the operating partnership’s long-term debt. The operating partnership uses its unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital requirements. The total amount available under the credit facility fluctuates based upon the borrowing base, as defined in the agreement governing the credit facility, which is generally based upon the value of our unencumbered properties. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on the credit facility was $216.8 million and the remaining amount available was $244.8 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $38.4 million (excluding the additional $200.0 million of potential additional capacity). The outstanding balance included borrowings denominated in Euros and Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, would equal approximately $173.1 million and $43.7 million in U.S. dollars, respectively. On June 29, 2004, AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement providing for loans or letters of credit. On December 8, 2005, the unsecured revolving credit agreement was amended to increase the maximum principal amount outstanding at 53 Table of Contents any time to up to 35.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, equaled approximately $297.2 million U.S. dollars, and can be increased to up to 40.0 billion Yen upon certain conditions. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the revolving credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest, and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the revolving credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan. Generally, borrowers under the revolving credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the revolving credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. The revolving credit facility matures in June 2007 and has a one-year extension option, which is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.25% of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the current credit rating of the operating partnership’s long-term debt and is currently 60 basis points. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s long-term debt, and is currently 20 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, was $205.8 million in U.S. dollars. On November 24, 2004, AMB Tokai TMK, a Japanese subsidiary of the operating partnership, entered into a secured multi-advance project financing, providing for loans in a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of up to 20.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, would equal approximately $169.9 million U.S. dollars. The financing agreement is among AMB Tokai TMK, us, the operating partnership, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and a syndicate of banks. We, along with the operating partnership, jointly and severally guarantee AMB Tokai TMK’s obligations under the financing agreement, pursuant to a guaranty of payment executed in connection with the project financing. The financing is secured by a mortgage on certain real property located in Tokai, Tokyo, Japan, and matures on October 31, 2006 with a one-year extension option. The rate on the borrowings will generally be TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s long-term debt and is currently 60 basis points per annum, except that AMB Tokai TMK has purchased from Sumitomo an interest rate swap, which has fixed the interest rate payable on a principal amount equal to 13.0 billion Yen at 1.32% per annum plus the applicable margin. In addition, there is an annual commitment fee based on unused commitments, payable quarterly, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s long-term debt, and is currently 20 basis points of the amount of unused commitments. The financing agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. In addition, Sumitomo, AMB Tokai TMK and the operating partnership signed a commitment letter on November 24, 2004, pursuant to which Sumitomo committed to purchase bonds that may be issued by AMB Tokai TMK in an amount between 10.0 billion Yen and 15.0 billion Yen (such amount to be determined by AMB Tokai TMK). The bonds would be secured by the AMB Ohta Distribution Center and would generally accrue interest at a rate of TIBOR plus 1.10% per annum; because the swap purchased by AMB Tokai TMK from Sumitomo is coterminous with the maturity date of the proposed bonds, AMB Tokai TMK will have fixed the interest rate payable on, in general, a principal amount equal to 13.0 billion Yen at 2.42% per annum. The bonds, if issued, would mature on October 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on this financing agreement was 19.5 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2005, equaled approximately $165.6 million U.S. dollars and is accounted for as wholly-owned secured debt. On February 16, 2006, the operating partnership and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement for a $250 million unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility with a maturity date of February 2010, that replaced the then-existing $100 million unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility that was to mature in June 2008. As of December 31, 2005, we had an additional outstanding balance of $67.5 million under the then-existing facility. 54 Table of Contents Mortgages Receivable. Through a wholly-owned subsidiary, we hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2005, the outstanding balance on the note was $12.8 million. We also hold a loan receivable on G. Accion, an unconsolidated joint venture totaling $8.8 million with an interest rate of 10.0%. The loan matures in November 2006. The tables below summarize our debt maturities, capitalization and reconcile our share of total debt to total consolidated debt as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): Debt Our Joint Unsecured Secured Venture Senior Debt Unsecured Credit Debt(4) Debt Securities Debt Facilities(1) Total Debt 2006 $ 65,369 $ 79,262 $ 75,000 $ 16,280 $ — $ 235,911 2007 12,680 58,124 75,000 752 422,602 569,158 2008 40,705 178,795 175,000 810 67,470 462,780 2009 5,264 120,551 100,000 873 — 226,688 2010 71,078 116,927 250,000 941 — 438,946 2011 21,573 357,207 75,000 1,014 — 454,794 2012 254,996 171,442 — 1,093 — 427,531 2013 14,773 196,894 — 920 — 212,587 2014 15,066 4,684 — 616 — 20,366 2015 1,951 61,653 100,000 664 — 164,268 Thereafter 19,004 32,544 125,000 — — 176,548 Subtotal 522,459 1,378,083 975,000 23,963 490,072 3,389,577 Unamortized premiums 2,577 9,407 — — — 11,984 Total consolidated debt 525,036 1,387,490 975,000 23,963 490,072 3,401,561 Our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt(2) — 161,120 — — — 161,120 Total debt 525,036 1,548,610 975,000 23,963 490,072 3,562,681 Joint venture partners’ share of consolidated joint venture debt — (960,803 ) — — — (960,803 ) Our share of total debt(3) $ 525,036 $ 587,807 $ 975,000 $ 23,963 $ 490,072 $ 2,601,878 Weighted average interest rate 4.1 % 6.3 % 6.2 % 8.2 % 2.2 % 5.3 % Weighted average maturity (in years) 5.8 5.7 5.2 3.1 1.6 4.9 (1) Includes $173.1 million, $249.5 million and $67.5 million in Euro, Yen and Canadian dollar based borrowings, respectively, translated to U.S. dollars using the functional exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2005. (2) The weighted average interest and maturity for the unconsolidated joint venture debt were 5.3% and 3.7 years, respectively. (3) Our share of total debt is the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated or unconsolidated ventures holding the debt. We believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. The above table reconciles our share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure. 55 Table of Contents (4) Our secured debt and joint venture debt include debt related to international assets in the amount of $383.0 million. Of this, $250.5 million is associated with assets located in Asia and the remaining $132.5 million is related to assets located in Europe.

Our definition of “market equity” is the total number of outstanding shares of our common stock and common limited partnership units multiplied by the closing price per share of our common stock as of December 31, 2005. Our definition of “preferred” is preferred equity liquidation preferences. Our share of total book capitalization is defined as our share of total debt plus minority interests to preferred unitholders and limited partnership unitholders plus stockholders’ equity. Our share of total debt is the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated or unconsolidated ventures holding the debt. We 56 Table of Contents believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. For a reconciliation of our share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure, please see the table of debt maturities and capitalization above. Liquidity As of December 31, 2005, we had $232.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $368.8 million of additional available borrowings under our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2005, we had $34.4 million in restricted cash. Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 of $0.44 per share of common stock, and the operating partnership announced its intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 of $0.44 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on January 6, 2006 to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 22, 2005. The series L and M preferred stock dividends were payable on January 16, 2006 to stockholders of record on January 6, 2006. The series E, F, J and K preferred unit quarterly distributions were payable on January 15, 2006. The series O preferred stock dividends are payable on April 15, 2006. The series D, H, I and N preferred unit quarterly distributions were paid on December 25, 2005. The following table sets forth the dividends and distributions paid or payable per share or unit for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003: Paying Entity Security 2005 2004 2003 AMB Property Corporation Common stock $ 1.76 $ 1.70 $ 1.66 AMB Property Corporation Series A preferred stock n/a n/a $ 1.15 AMB Property Corporation Series L preferred stock $ 1.63 $ 1.63 $ 0.85 AMB Property Corporation Series M preferred stock $ 1.69 $ 1.69 $ 0.17 AMB Property Corporation Series O preferred stock $ 0.09 n/a n/a Operating Partnership Common limited partnership units $ 1.76 $ 1.70 $ 1.66 Operating Partnership Series B preferred units n/a n/a $ 3.71 Operating Partnership Series J preferred units $ 3.98 $ 3.98 $ 3.98 Operating Partnership Series K preferred units $ 3.98 $ 3.98 $ 3.98 AMB Property II, L.P.

The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would 57 Table of Contents adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Commitments Developments. In addition to recurring capital expenditures, which consist of building improvements and leasing costs incurred to renew or re-tenant space, during 2005, we initiated 30 new industrial development projects in North America, Europe and Asia with a total estimated investment of $522.4 million, aggregating an estimated 7.0 million square feet. As of December 31, 2005, we had 47 projects in our development pipeline representing a total estimated investment of $1.1 billion upon completion, of which two industrial projects with a total of 0.3 million square feet and an aggregate estimated investment of $24.5 million upon completion are held in unconsolidated joint ventures. In addition, we held one development project available for sale or contribution, representing a total estimated investment of $32.8 million upon completion. Of the total development pipeline, $681.4 million had been funded as of December 31, 2005 and an estimated $405.2 million was required to complete current and planned projects. We expect to fund these expenditures with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances, net proceeds from property divestitures and private capital from co-investment partners, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. Acquisitions. During 2005, we acquired 41 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet for a total expected investment of $555.0 million, including two buildings that were acquired by two of our unconsolidated co-investment joint ventures. Additional acquisition activity in 2005 included the purchase of an approximate 43% unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, one of Mexico’s largest real estate companies, for $46.1 million. We generally fund our acquisitions through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facility, cash, debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on-tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from one to 57 years. These operating lease payments are amortized ratably over the terms of the related leases. Future minimum rental payments required under non-cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2005 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2006 $ 20,894 2007 21,036 2008 20,617 2009 20,327 2010 19,997 Thereafter 278,759 Total $ 381,630 Co-investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co-investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co-investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2005, we had investments in co-investment joint ventures with a gross book value of $2.5 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and net equity investments in two unconsolidated co-investment joint ventures of $26.3 million. As of December 31, 2005, we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co-investment joint ventures of up to $133.7 million (using the exchange rates at December 31, 2005). From time to time, we may raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open-ended consolidated co-investment joint venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, which invest through a private real estate investment trust. This would increase our obligation to make additional capital commitments. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of this fund, we are obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments to the fund until such time our total equity commitment is greater than 58 Table of Contents $150.0 million, at which time, our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely effect our cash flow. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, we formed a wholly-owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our third-party policies. We capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. have a retrospective component, so that if expenses, including losses, deductibles and reserves, are less than premiums collected, the excess may be returned to the property owners (and, in turn, as appropriate, to the customers) and, conversely, subject to certain limitations, if expenses, including losses, deductibles and reserves, are greater than premiums collected, an additional premium will be charged. As with all recoverable expenses, differences between estimated and actual insurance premiums are recognized in the subsequent year. Through this structure, we believe that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Unknown Liabilities. Unknown liabilities may include the following: • liabilities for clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; • claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation transactions; • accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; • tax liabilities; and • claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. Overview of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our debt, interest and lease payments due by period as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): Less than More than Contractual Obligations 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years Total Debt $ 235,911 $ 1,031,938 $ 665,634 $ 1,456,094 $ 3,389,577 Debt interest payments 14,459 46,749 37,056 83,106 181,370 Operating lease commitments 20,894 41,653 49,324 278,759 381,630 Construction commitments — 136,600 — — 136,600 Total $ 271,264 $ 1,256,940 $ 743,014 $ 1,817,959 $ 4,089,177 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Standby Letters of Credit. As of December 31, 2005, we had provided approximately $48.7 million in letters of credit, of which $38.4 million was provided under the operating partnership’s $500.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees. As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding guarantees in the aggregate amount of $128.2 million in connection with certain acquisitions. As of December 31, 2005, we guaranteed $23.4 million 59 Table of Contents and $2.3 million on outstanding loans on two of our consolidated joint ventures and one of our unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2005, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $0.9 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of its development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure, such as grading, sewers and streets. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promoted Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain of joint venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us. From time to time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES FFO. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. FFO is defined as net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate-related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non-recurring charges. We believe that FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. 60 Table of Contents The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 Net income(1) $ 257,807 $ 125,471 $ 129,128 $ 121,119 $ 136,200 Gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests(2) (132,652 ) (47,224 ) (50,325 ) (19,383 ) (41,859 ) Real estate, related depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 165,438 141,120 116,067 107,097 90,527 Discontinued operations’ depreciation 14,866 26,230 26,270 29,406 23,016 Non-real estate depreciation (3,388 ) (871 ) (720 ) (712 ) (731 ) Ground lease amortization — — — (2,301 ) (1,232 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from consolidated joint ventures: Joint venture partners’ minority interests (Net income) 36,398 29,544 21,015 15,112 11,288 Limited partnership unitholders’ minority interests (Net income) 3,681 2,615 2,378 3,572 4,836 Limited partnership unitholders’ minority interests (Development profits) 2,262 435 344 57 764 Discontinued operations’ minority interests (Net income) 8,502 13,549 16,214 17,745 17,595 FFO attributable to minority interests (100,275 ) (80,192 ) (65,603 ) (52,051 ) (40,144 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures: Our share of net income (10,770 ) (3,781 ) (5,445 ) (5,674 ) (5,467 ) Our share of FFO 14,441 7,549 9,755 9,291 8,014 Our share of development profits, net of taxes 5,441 — — — — Preferred stock dividends (7,388 ) (7,131 ) (6,999 ) (8,496 ) (8,500 ) Preferred stock and unit redemption discount (issuance costs) — — (5,413 ) 412 (7,600 ) Funds from operations $ 254,363 $ 207,314 $ 186,666 $ 215,194 $ 186,707 Basic FFO per common share and unit $ 2.87 $ 2.39 $ 2.17 $ 2.44 $ 2.09 Diluted FFO per common share and unit $ 2.75 $ 2.30 $ 2.13 $ 2.40 $ 2.07 Weighted average common shares and units: Basic 88,684,262 86,885,250 85,859,899 88,204,208 89,286,379 Diluted 92,508,725 90,120,250 87,616,365 89,689,310 90,325,801 61 Table of Contents (1) Includes gains from undepreciated land sales of $25.0 million, $3.7 million and $1.2 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (2) 2005 includes accumulated depreciation re-capture of approximately $1.1 million associated with the sale of the Interstate Crossdock redevelopment project. SS NOI. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider same store net operating income (SS NOI) to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. For properties that are considered part of the same store pool, see Part I, Item 2: “Properties — Industrial Properties — Industrial Market Operating Statistics”, Note 5, and “Operating and Leasing Statistics — Industrial Same Store Operating Statistics”, Note 1. In deriving SS NOI, we define NOI as rental revenues (as calculated in accordance with GAAP), including reimbursements, less straight-line rents, property operating expenses and real estate taxes. We exclude straight-line rents in calculating SS NOI because we believe it provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year-over-year comparison. In addition, we believe that SS NOI helps the investing public compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate as compared to other companies. While SS NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI also does not reflect general and administrative expenses, interest expenses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating SS NOI. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2005, we had two outstanding interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amount of $119.5 million (in U.S. dollars). See “Financial Instruments” below. The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before unamortized debt premiums of $12.0 million as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt(1) $ 165,953 $ 129,214 $ 374,174 $ 190,548 $ 437,934 $ 1,260,015 $ 2,557,838 Average interest rate 6.9 % 7.2 % 6.9 % 5.0 % 6.1 % 6.3 % 6.3 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 69,958 $ 439,944 $ 88,606 $ 36,140 $ 1,012 $ 196,079 $ 831,739 Average interest rate 4.3 % 2.2 % 2.2 % 2.2 % 2.0 % 1.9 % 2.3 % Interest Payments $ 14,459 $ 18,982 $ 27,767 $ 10,322 $ 26,734 $ 83,106 $ 181,370 (1) Represents 75.5% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 24.5% of all outstanding debt. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased or decreased by 10%, then the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $1.9 million annually. As of December 31, 2005, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.4 billion based on our estimate of current market interest rates. 62 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, variable rate debt comprised 24.5% and 15.3%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $831.7 million and $498.3 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non-functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2005 were two interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of our variable rate borrowings based on Euribor (Europe) and Japanese TIBOR (Japan) and two put options hedging against adverse foreign fluctuations of the Mexican Peso and the Euro against the U.S. dollar.

Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside North America is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity is located, mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement 63 Table of Contents date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The losses resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders’ equity and totaled $1.8 million for year ended December 31, 2005. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non-monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2005, gains from remeasurement and the sale of one foreign exchange agreement included in our results of operations totaled $0.6 million. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. We believe that these gains or losses are immaterial.",2023-12-30 18:36:15.525186
1045609,PLD,"Prologis, Inc.",2007,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements. We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company effective with the completion of our initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, with our initial tax return for the year ended December 31, 1997. AMB Property Corporation and AMB Property, L.P. were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering. Management’s Overview The primary source of our revenue and earnings is rent received from customers under long-term (generally three to ten years) operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs, and from partnership distributions and fees from our private capital business. We also produce earnings from the disposition of operating assets that no longer fit our strategy, from the disposition of projects in our development-for-sale program and from the contributions of properties to our co-investment joint ventures. Our long-term growth is driven by our ability to maintain and increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties, and by our ability to continue to acquire and develop new properties. National industrial markets continued to improve during 2006 when compared with market conditions in 2005. According to Torto Wheaton Research, availability dropped 10 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2006 to 9.4%, and availability for the year dropped 50 basis points. We believe the strongest industrial markets in the U.S. are the coastal gateway markets tied to global trade, including Los Angeles, our largest market, Miami, the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle, and to a lesser degree Northern New Jersey/New York (with the exception of the Exit 8A submarket). While we believe that the broader Chicago market is showing signs of stabilization, certain submarkets, like the O’Hare submarket, are relatively strong. We believe Dallas continues to recover, and Atlanta continues to suffer from a large increase in supply. We believe the operating environment in our U.S. on-tarmac business remains good with improving cargo volumes and essentially no new supply. Investor demand for industrial property (as supported by our observation of strong national sales volumes and declining acquisition capitalization rates) has remained consistently strong over the past several years. We believe we capitalized on this demand for industrial property by accelerating the repositioning of our portfolio, through the disposition of non-core properties, which was effectively completed in 2006 with our exit from the Charlotte and Memphis markets. We plan to continue selling selected assets on an opportunistic basis or that no longer fit our strategic investment objectives, but we believe we have substantially achieved our repositioning goals. Occupancy levels in our portfolio continue to outperform the national industrial market, as determined by Torto Wheaton Research, by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions. During the prior periods of decreasing or stabilizing rental rates, we strove to sign leases with shorter terms to prevent locking in lower rent levels for long periods and to be prepared to sign new, longer-term leases during periods of growing rental rates. When we sign leases of shorter duration, we attempt to limit overall leasing costs and capital expenditures by offering different grades of tenant improvement packages, appropriate to the lease term. In our stronger markets, we are increasing rents as opposed to occupancy. 40 The table below summarizes key operating and leasing statistics for our owned and managed operating properties for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: U.S. Hub and Total Other Total/Weighted Owned and Managed Property Data(1) Gateway Markets(2) Markets(3) Average For the year ended December 31, 2006: % of total rentable square feet 72.0 % 28.0 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 96.5 % 95.0 % 96.1 % Same space square footage leased 13,016,726 3,186,854 16,203,580 Rent (decreases) increases on renewals and rollovers(4) (0.4 )% 1.6 % (0.1 )% For the year ended December 31, 2005:(5) % of total rentable square feet 74.9 % 25.1 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 96.2 % 94.6 % 95.8 % Same space square footage leased 11,032,482 2,574,944 13,607,426 Rent decreases on renewals and rollovers (10.8 )% (4.3 )% (9.7 )% (1) Schedule includes owned and managed operating properties which we define as properties in which we have at least a 10% ownership interest, for which we are the property or asset manager, and which we intend to hold for the long-term. (2) Our U.S. hub and gateway markets include on-tarmac and Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, Northern New Jersey/New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, and Seattle. (3) Our total markets include other U.S. target markets, other non-target markets, and non-U.S. target markets. (4) On a consolidated basis, rent increases on renewals and rollovers were 4.4% and 3.0%, respectively, for U.S. hub and gateway markets and total other markets. (5) The information for 2005 is presented on a consolidated basis while the information for 2006 is presented on an owned and managed basis. Management believes that the difference in comparability between the information for 2006 and 2005 is not significant. At December 31, 2006, our operating portfolio’s occupancy rate was 96.1%, on an owned and managed basis (97.0% on a consolidated basis), an increase from both the prior quarter and December 31, 2005. Rental rates on lease renewals and rollovers in our portfolio increased 4.1% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and decreased 0.1% for the full year. Cash basis same store net operating income (rental revenues less property operating expenses and real estate taxes for properties included in the same store pool, which is set annually and excludes properties purchased or developments stabilized after December 31, 2004) grew by 1.3% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 2.6% for the full-year 2006, on an owned and managed basis. Excluding lease termination fees, same store net operating income grew 3.0% and 3.2% in the quarter and for the full year (decreased 0.5% and increased 1.6%, respectively, on a consolidated basis), respectively, on an owned and managed basis. See Part II, Item 7: “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Supplemental Earnings Measures” for a discussion of same store net operating income and a reconciliation of same store net operating income and net income. We currently expect that same store growth in our operating portfolio, excluding lease termination fees, will be about 3% to 4% for 2007, on an owned and managed basis. Market rents continue to rebound from their lows and in many of our hub and gateway markets are back to or above their prior peak levels of 2001. We believe that industrial market rents in the San Francisco Bay Area are improving. While market rents in the San Francisco Bay Area were up 10% to 15% in 2006, rents still have not yet fully recovered to normal levels. Rents on lease renewals and rollovers in the San Francisco Bay Area declined 21.0% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and 13.2% for the full-year 2006, on an owned and managed basis. Without the effect of the San Francisco Bay Area, rents on renewals and rollovers for the full-year 2006 would have been 2.0%, on an owned and managed basis, which we believe reflects the generally positive trends in U.S. industrial space availability. We expect development to be a significant driver of our earnings growth as we expand our land and development pipeline, and contribute completed development projects into our co-investment program and recognize development profits. We believe that development, renovation and expansion of well-located, high- 41 quality industrial properties should generally continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of existing properties. We believe that our development opportunities in Mexico, Japan and China are particularly attractive given the current lack of supply of modern industrial distribution facilities in the major metropolitan markets of these countries. Prior to our global expansion, our development pipeline was $106.8 million at the end of 2002. As a result of our global expansion and increased development capabilities, we have increased our development pipeline to approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2006. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 1,735 acres for future development or sale, of which 92% is in North America. We believe these 1,735 acres of land could support approximately 30.5 million square feet of future development. Going forward, we believe that our co-investment program with private-capital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for new investments. Through these co-investment joint ventures, we typically earn acquisition fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, as well as promoted interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the co-investment joint ventures; however, we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so. Through contribution of development properties to our co-investment joint ventures, we expect to recognize value creation from our development pipeline. As of December 31, 2006, we owned approximately 64.3 million square feet of our properties (51.6% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these co-investment joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. By the end of 2010, we expect to have approximately 50% of our owned and managed operating portfolio invested in non-U.S. markets (based on owned and managed annualized base rent). As of December 31, 2006, our non-U.S. operating properties comprised 14.1% of our owned and managed operating portfolio (based on annualized base rent) and 7.4% of our consolidated operating portfolio (based on annualized base rent). Our North American target countries outside of the United States currently comprise Canada and Mexico. Our European target countries currently comprise Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. Our Asian target countries currently comprise China, India, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. We expect to add additional target countries outside the United States in the future. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our on-going operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can. We must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital. Summary of Key Transactions in 2006 During the year ended December 31, 2006, we completed the following significant capital deployment and other transactions: • Acquired, on an owned and managed basis, 106 buildings in North America and Europe, aggregating approximately 9.8 million square feet, for $834.2 million; • Committed to 30 development projects in North America, Asia and Europe totaling 10.4 million square feet with an estimated total investment of approximately $914.3 million; • Acquired 835 acres of land for development in North America and Asia for approximately $293.2 million; • Sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million; • Contributed four completed development projects for $486.2 million to AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., two completed development projects for $56.4 million to AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, three completed development projects for $64.8 million to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. and one land parcel for $77.5 million to AMB DFS Fund I, LLC, all of which entities are unconsolidated co-investment joint ventures.

See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 6, 9 and 11 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. We also regularly review the impact of above or below-market leases, in-place leases and lease origination costs for all new acquisitions, and record an intangible asset or liability accordingly. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property-by-property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economics and market conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying value of our long-lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. As a result of leasing activity and the economic environment, we re-evaluated the carrying value of our investments and recorded impairment charges of $6.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 on certain of our investments. Revenue Recognition. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an on-going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight-line rents, for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed. We also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customer’s occupancy. Property Dispositions. We report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by third-party investors for cash and are included in gains from disposition of real estate interests in the statement of operations. Second, we dispose of value-added conversion projects and build-to-suit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable, and are included in development profits, net of taxes, in the statement of operations. Lastly, 44 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, requires us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties, which is included in gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests, in the statement of operations. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met. Joint Ventures. We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We determine consolidation based on standards set forth in EITF 04-5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights or FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities “FIN 46”. Based on the guidance set forth in EITF 04-5, we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. For joint ventures that are variable interest entities as defined under FIN 46 where we are not the primary beneficiaries, we do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. For joint ventures under EITF 04-5, where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, but where we exercise significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the U.S. if we meet minimum distribution, income, asset and shareholder tests. However, some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable real estate investment trust subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as depreciation and gain recognition. However, we believe deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on a prospective basis, due to the re-evaluation of the accounting for our investment in the fund in light of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the general partner’s rights effective October 1, 2006. As a result, our results of operations presented below are not comparable between years presented. The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. Same store properties are those that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development properties stabilized after December 31, 2004 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties for which we have held a certificate of occupancy or where building has been substantially complete for at least 12 months). As of December 31, 2006, same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 71.2 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. During 2006, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 50 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.5 million square feet. In 2005, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 150 buildings, aggregating approximately 10.6 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results. 45 For the Years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (dollars in millions) Revenues 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 514.9 $ 501.5 $ 13.4 2.7 % 2006 acquisitions 4.4 — 4.4 — % 2005 acquisitions 19.4 11.4 8.0 70.2 % Development 8.3 7.4 0.9 12.2 % Other industrial 74.3 63.6 10.7 16.8 % Non U.S. industrial 62.5 33.1 29.4 88.8 % Total rental revenues 683.8 617.0 66.8 10.8 % Private capital income 46.1 43.9 2.2 5.0 % Total revenues $ 729.9 $ 660.9 $ 69.0 10.4 % U.S. industrial same store revenues increased $13.4 million from the prior year despite the decrease of $12.8 million in same store revenues due to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., effective October 1, 2006, attributable primarily to improved occupancy and increased rental rates in various markets. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. Non-U.S. industrial revenues increased approximately $29.4 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of three properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties in France, Germany and Mexico. The increase in private capital income was primarily due to increased asset management and acquisition fees from additional assets held in co-investment joint ventures, which were partially offset by a decrease in incentive distributions of approximately $3.9 million. During 2006, we received 46 incentive distributions of $22.5 million, of which $19.8 million was from AMB Partners II, L.P., as compared to incentive distribution of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., during 2005.

The 2005 acquisitions consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The 2006 acquisitions consisted of 73 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. Non-U.S. industrial revenues increased approximately $6.0 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of three properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties in France, Germany and Mexico. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The 2006 impairment loss was taken on several non-core assets as a result of leasing activities and changes in the economic environment and the holding period of certain assets. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock-based compensation expense as a result of higher values assigned to option and stock awards and executive departures, additional staffing and expenses for our international expansion, and the acquisition of AMB Blackpine. Other expenses decreased approximately $2.4 million from the prior year due primarily to a decrease in losses associated with our deferred compensation plan and a decrease in certain deal costs. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co-investment joint ventures. 47 Other Income and (Expenses) 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures, net $ 23.2 $ 10.8 $ 12.4 114.8 % Other income 9.4 5.6 3.8 67.9 % Gains from dispositions of real estate interests, net — 19.1 (19.1 ) (100.0 )% Development profits, net of taxes 106.4 54.8 51.6 94.2 % Interest expense, including amortization (165.2 ) (147.3 ) 17.9 12.2 % Total other income and (expenses), net $ (26.2 ) $ (57.0 ) $ (30.8 ) (54.0 )% The $12.4 million increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was primarily due to gains of $17.5 million from the disposition of real estate by our unconsolidated co-investment joint ventures during 2006 as opposed to $5.5 million of such gains during 2005 and, effective October 1, 2006, the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., which resulted in an increase of approximately $5.1 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase in expenses by our unconsolidated joint ventures. The increase in other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income and an increase in property management income due to the expansion of our property management business. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using the exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our then newly formed unconsolidated co-investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development-for-sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased disposition and contribution volume during 2006. During 2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the joint venture partner’s share. During 2006, we also contributed a total of ten completed development projects into unconsolidated co-investment joint ventures. Four projects totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, three projects totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and one land parcel into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after-tax gain of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third-party investors for cash. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after-tax gain of $1.9 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third-party co-investor for cash. The increase in interest expense, including amortization, was due primarily to increased borrowings on unsecured credit facilities and other debt. Discontinued Operations 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Income attributable to discontinued operations, net of minority interests $ 9.3 $ 13.9 $ (4.6 ) (33.1 )% Gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests 42.6 113.6 (71.0 ) (62.5 )% Total discontinued operations $ 51.9 $ 127.5 $ (75.6 ) (59.3 )% During 2006, we divested ourselves of 39 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 3.5 million square feet, for an aggregate price of approximately $175.3 million, with a resulting net gain of approximately $42.6 million. During 2005, we divested ourselves of 142 industrial buildings and one retail center, aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $926.6 million, with a resulting net gain of $113.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., for $618.5 million. The multi-investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We 48 received cash and a distribution of an on-tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. Preferred Stock 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Preferred stock dividends $ (13.6 ) $ (7.4 ) $ 6.2 83.8 % Preferred unit redemption issuance costs (1.1 ) — 1.1 — % Total preferred stock dividends $ (14.7 ) $ (7.4 ) $ 7.3 98.6 % In December 2005, we issued 3,000,000 shares of 7.0% Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. In August 2006, we issued 2,000,000 shares of 6.85% Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all 840,000 of its outstanding 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 220,440 of its outstanding 7.75% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 201,139 of its outstanding 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 729,582 of its outstanding 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. As a result, we recognized a decrease in income available to common stockholders of $1.1 million for the original issuance costs, net of discount on repurchase. For the Years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 (dollars in millions) Revenues 2005 2004 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 501.5 $ 489.9 $ 11.6 2.4 % 2005 acquisitions 11.4 3.2 8.2 256.3 % Development 7.4 8.6 (1.2 ) (14.0 )% Other industrial 63.6 34.6 29.0 83.8 % Non U.S. industrial 33.1 27.2 5.9 21.7 % Total rental revenues 617.0 563.5 53.5 9.5 % Private capital income 43.9 12.9 31.0 240.3 % Total revenues $ 660.9 $ 576.4 $ 84.5 14.7 % U.S. industrial same store revenues increased $11.6 million from 2004 to 2005 on a year-to-date basis attributable primarily to improved occupancy and increased rental rates in various markets. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The increase in private capital income was primarily due to increased asset management fees from additional assets held in co-investment joint ventures and incentive distributions for 2005 of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, asset 49 management priority distributions from AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., and acquisition fees from AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.

The 2004 acquisitions consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The 2005 acquisitions consisted of 41 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2004 and 2005, we continued to acquire properties in China, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial property operating costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate during the year. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions and the expansion of satellite offices. Other expenses increased approximately $2.4 million from the prior year due primarily to greater losses on our non-qualified deferred compensation plan in 2005 and an increase in certain deal costs. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co-investment joint ventures.

The increase in other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated co-investment joint venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. The 2004 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted from our contribution of $71.5 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co-investment joint venture, AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC. Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development-for-sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased volume in 2005. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated joint venture, AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after-tax gain of $1.9 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third-party co-investor for cash. During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our development-for-sale program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after-tax gain of $2.0 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third-party co-investor for cash.

Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Alliance Fund I for $618.5 million. The multi-investor fund owned 100 buildings totaling approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on-tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. During 2004, we divested ourselves of 21 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office building, aggregating approximately 3.1 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $200.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.0 million.

The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, we use unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and common equity (issued by us and/or the operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our 100%-owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non-recourse, secured debt encumbering our 100%-owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes. In managing our co-investment joint ventures, in general, we use non-recourse, secured debt to capitalize our co-investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: • retained earnings and cash flow from operations; 51 • private capital from co-investment partners; • net proceeds from contribution of properties and completed development projects to our co-investment joint ventures; • borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities; • other forms of secured or unsecured financing; • proceeds from equity (common and preferred) or debt securities offerings; • proceeds from limited partnership unit offerings (including issuances of limited partnership units by our subsidiaries); and • net proceeds from divestitures of properties. We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will include: • working capital; • development, expansion and renovation of properties; • acquisitions, including our global expansion; • debt service; and • dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred stock and limited partnership units. Cash flows. As of December 31, 2006, cash provided by operating activities was $335.9 million as compared to $295.8 million for the same period in 2005. This change is primarily due to increases in rental rates, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses primarily due to additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions and increased occupancy costs related to the expansion of regional offices. Cash used for investing activities was $880.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to cash used for investing activities of $60.4 million for the same period in 2005. This change is primarily due to an increase in funds used for property acquisitions and capital expenditures, and a decrease in proceeds from property divestitures (mainly due to the divesture of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., portfolio in 2005), offset by less funds used for additions to interests in unconsolidated joint ventures and an increase in capital distributions received from unconsolidated joint ventures. Cash provided by financing activities was $483.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to cash used in financing activities of $101.9 million for the same period in 2005. This change is due primarily to an increase in borrowings, net of repayments, issuance of common stock upon the exercise of options and issuances of preferred stock, offset by the cost of the repurchase of preferred units for the year ended December 31, 2006. We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facilities and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Resources Property Divestitures. During 2006, we divested ourselves of 39 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 3.5 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $175.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.6 million. Development Sales. During 2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the joint venture partner’s share. 52 Development Contributions. During 2006, we contributed a total of nine completed development projects and one land parcel into unconsolidated co-investment joint ventures. Four projects totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, and three projects totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. In addition, one land parcel was contributed into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after-tax gain of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third-party investors for cash. These gains are included in development profits, net of taxes, in the statement of operations. Properties Held for Contribution. As of December 31, 2006, we held for contribution to co-investment joint ventures, nine industrial projects with an aggregate net book value of $154.0 million, which, when contributed to a joint venture, will reduce our current ownership interest from approximately 100% to an expected range of 15-50%. Properties Held for Divestiture. As of December 31, 2006, we held for divestiture four industrial projects, which are not in our core markets, do not meet our current strategic objectives or which we have included as part of our development-for-sale program. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. As of December 31, 2006, the net carrying value of the properties held for divestiture was $20.9 million. Expected net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the properties. Co-investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co-investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co-investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. We generally consolidate these joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because they are not variable interest entities and because we are the sole managing general partner and control all major operating decisions. However, in certain cases, our co-investment joint ventures are unconsolidated because we do not control all major operating decisions and the general partners do not have significant rights under EITF 04-5. Third-party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2006, we owned approximately 64.3 million square feet of our properties (51.6% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so.

(7) AMB DFS Fund I, LLC is a co-investment partnership formed in 2006 with a subsidiary of GE Real Estate to build and sell properties.

The investment is not consolidated because we do not exercise control over major operating decisions such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, investment activity and changes in financing. We have an option to purchase the remaining equity interest beginning January 1, 2007 and expiring December 31, 2009, based on the fair market value as stipulated in the joint venture agreement. As of December 31, 2006, we also had an approximate 39.0% unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, a Mexican real estate company. G.Accion provides management and development services for industrial, retail, residential and office properties in Mexico. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, one of our subsidiaries also had an approximate 5% interest in IAT Air Cargo Facilities Income Fund (IAT), a Canadian income trust specializing in aviation-related real estate at Canada’s leading international airports. This equity investment is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Common and Preferred Equity. We have authorized for issuance 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which the following series were designated as of December 31, 2006: 1,595,337 shares of series D preferred; 510,000 shares of series I cumulative redeemable preferred; 800,000 shares of series J cumulative redeemable preferred; 800,000 shares of series K cumulative redeemable preferred; 2,300,000 shares of series L cumulative redeemable preferred, of which 2,000,000 are outstanding; 2,300,000 shares of series M cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding; 3,000,000 shares of series O cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding; and 2,000,000 shares of series P cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding.

On September 24, 2004, AMB Property II, L.P., a partnership in which Texas AMB I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and our indirect subsidiary, owns an approximate 8.0% general partnership interest and the operating partnership owns an approximate 92% common limited partnership interest, issued 729,582 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a price of $50.00 per unit. The series N preferred units were issued to Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. in exchange for the contribution to AMB Property II, L.P of certain parcels of land that are located in multiple markets. Effective January 27, 2006, Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. exercised its rights under its Put Agreement, dated September 24, 2004, with the operating partnership, and sold all of the series N preferred units to the operating partnership for an aggregate price of $36.6 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions.

The operating partnership used the proceeds, in addition to proceeds previously contributed to the operating partnership from other equity issuances, to redeem all 3,995,800 of its 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units from us on July 28, 2003. We, in turn, used those proceeds to redeem all 3,995,800 of our 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $100.2 million, including all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, to the redemption date. In December 2005, our board of directors approved a new two-year common stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. We did not repurchase or retire any shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2006. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend to operate with an our share of total debt-to-our share of total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2006, our share of total debt-to-our share of total market capitalization ratio was 34.2%. (See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for our definitions of “our share of total market capitalization,” “market equity” and “our share of total debt.”) However, we typically finance our co-investment joint ventures with secured debt at a loan-to-value ratio of 50-65% per our joint venture agreements. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2006, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.4 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $6.3 million. Of the $1.4 billion of secured debt, $1.0 billion is secured by properties in our joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non-recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 2.9% to 10.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 6.2%) and final maturity dates ranging from February 2007 to January 2025. As of December 31, 2006, $1.0 billion of the secured debt obligations bear interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 6.1%, while the remaining $386.1 million bear interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 4.7%). As of December 31, 2006, the operating partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $1.1 billion in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.2% and had a weighted average term of 4.8 years. These unsecured senior debt securities include $300.0 million in notes issued in June 1998, $225.0 million of medium-term notes, which were issued under the operating partnership’s 2000 medium-term note program, $275.0 million of medium-term notes, which were issued under the operating partnership’s 2002 medium-term note program, $175.0 million of medium-term notes, which were issued under the operating partnership’s 2006 medium term-note program and approximately $112.5 million of 5.094% Notes Due 2015, which were issued to Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America on July 11, 2005 in a private placement, in exchange for the cancellation of $100.0 million of notes that were issued in June 1998 resulting in a discount of approximately $12.5 million. The unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various covenants. Also included is a $25.0 million promissory note which matures in January 2007. We guarantee the operating partnership’s obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. On June 1, 2006, the operating partnership entered into a third amended and restated $550.0 million unsecured revolving credit agreement that replaced its then-existing $500.0 million credit facility, which was to mature on June 1, 2007. We are a guarantor of the operating partnership’s obligations under the credit facility. The line, which matures on June 1, 2010, carries a one-year extension option and can be increased to up to 56 $700.0 million upon certain conditions. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the operating partnership’s long-term debt rating, which was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2006, with an annual facility fee of 15 basis points. The four-year credit facility includes a multi-currency component, under which up to $550.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Euros, Yen or British Pounds Sterling. The operating partnership uses its unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on the credit facility was $303.7 million and the remaining amount available was $234.6 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $11.7 million. The outstanding balance included borrowings denominated in Euros, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $303.7 million U.S. dollars. On June 23, 2006, AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership and as the initial borrower, entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement for a 45.0 billion Yen unsecured revolving credit facility, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $377.9 million U.S. dollars. This replaced the 35.0 billion Yen unsecured revolving credit facility executed on June 29, 2004, as previously amended, which using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $293.9 million U.S. dollars. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan, China and South Korea. Generally, borrowers under the credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. The credit facility matures in June 2010 and has a one-year extension option. The credit facility can be increased to up to 55.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, equaled approximately $461.9 million U.S. dollars. The extension option is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s long-term debt and was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2006. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s long-term debt, and was 15 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility as of December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2006, was $320.9 million in U.S. dollars. On June 13, 2006, the operating partnership and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries entered into a fourth amended and restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which replaced the third amended and restated credit agreement for a $250.0 million unsecured credit facility. On February 16, 2006, the third amended and restated credit agreement replaced the then-existing $100.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that was to mature in June 2008. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations for such subsidiaries and other entities controlled by us or the operating partnership that are selected by the operating partnership from time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant to the credit facility. The four-year credit facility includes a multi-currency component under which up to $250.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Singapore dollars, Canadian dollars and Euros. The line, which matures in February 2010 and carries a one-year extension option, can be increased to up to $350.0 million upon certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt, which was 60 basis points as of December 31, 2006, with an annual facility fee based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on this facility was approximately $227.4 million. The credit agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios by the operating partnership, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. 57 Mortgages Receivable. Through a wholly owned subsidiary, we hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2006, the outstanding balance on the note was $12.7 million. We also hold a loan receivable on G. Accion, an unconsolidated joint venture totaling $6.1 million with an interest rate of 10.0%. The loan matures in March 2010.

As of December 31, 2006, we had $21.1 million in restricted cash. Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 of $0.46 per share of common stock, and the operating partnership announced its intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 of $0.46 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on January 5, 2007 to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 22, 2006. The series L, M, O and P preferred stock dividends were payable on January 16, 2007 to stockholders of record on January 5, 2007. The series J and K preferred unit quarterly distributions were payable on January 16, 2007. The series D and I preferred unit quarterly distributions were paid on December 25, 2006. The following table sets forth the dividends and distributions paid or payable per share or unit for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: Paying Entity Security 2006 2005 2004 AMB Property Corporation Common stock $ 1.84 $ 1.76 $ 1.70 AMB Property Corporation Series L preferred stock $ 1.63 $ 1.63 $ 1.63 AMB Property Corporation Series M preferred stock $ 1.69 $ 1.69 $ 1.69 AMB Property Corporation Series O preferred stock $ 1.75 $ 0.09 n/a AMB Property Corporation Series P preferred stock $ 0.60 n/a n/a Operating Partnership Common limited partnership units $ 1.84 $ 1.76 $ 1.70 Operating Partnership Series J preferred units $ 3.98 $ 3.98 $ 3.98 Operating Partnership Series K preferred units $ 3.98 $ 3.98 $ 3.98 AMB Property II, L.P.

(2) In September 2006, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of its outstanding series F preferred units. (3) In March 2006, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of its outstanding series H preferred units. (4) The holder of the series N preferred units exercised its put option in January 2006 and sold all of its series N preferred units to the operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of such units from the operating partnership. The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Commitments Development Starts. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we initiated 30 new industrial development projects in North America, Europe and Asia with a total expected investment of $914.3 million, aggregating approximately 10.4 million square feet. During 2005, we initiated 30 new industrial development projects in North America, Europe and Asia with a total expected investment of $522.4 million, aggregating approximately 7.0 million square feet. 60 Development Pipeline. As of December 31, 2006, we had 45 industrial projects in our development pipeline, which will total approximately 13.7 million square feet, and will have an aggregate estimated investment of $1.3 billion upon completion. We have an additional ten development projects available for sale or contribution totaling approximately 3.0 million square feet, with an aggregate estimated investment of $199.2 million. One of these ten projects totaling $13.0 million and approximately 0.2 million square feet is held in an unconsolidated joint venture. As of December 31, 2006, we and our joint venture partners had funded an aggregate of $814.5 million and needed to fund an estimated additional $481.0 million in order to complete our development pipeline which includes projects expected to be completed through the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we acquired 835 acres of land for industrial warehouse development in North America and Asia for approximately $293.2 million. Acquisitions. During 2006, we acquired 106 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 9.8 million square feet for a total expected investment of $834.2 million (includes acquisition costs of $814.1 million and estimated acquisition capital of $20.1 million), of which we acquired 70 buildings through one of our unconsolidated co-investment joint ventures. We generally fund our acquisitions through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facilities, cash, debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on-tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from one to 55 years. These buildings and improvements are amortized ratably over the lesser of the terms of the related leases or 40 years. Future minimum rental payments required under non-cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2006 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2007 $ 21,636 2008 22,186 2009 21,506 2010 20,667 2011 20,668 Thereafter 272,483 Total $ 379,146 Co-investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co-investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co-investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2006, we had investments in co-investment joint ventures with a gross book value of $1.9 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and net equity investments in four unconsolidated co-investment joint ventures of $236.0 million and a gross book value of $2.5 billion. As of December 31, 2006, we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co-investment joint ventures of up to $168.2 million (using the exchange rates at December 31, 2006) pursuant to the terms of the joint venture agreements. From time to time, we may raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open-ended unconsolidated co-investment joint venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, which invests through a private real estate investment trust. This would increase our obligation to make additional capital commitments. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of this fund, we are obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments to the fund until such time our total equity commitment is greater than $150.0 million, at which time, our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely effect our cash flow. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., (Arcata), which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our third-party policies. The captive insurance company is one element of our overall risk management program. We capitalized Arcata in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, 61 we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata may be adjusted based on this estimate. Like premiums paid to third-party insurance companies, premiums paid to Arcata may be reimbursed by customers pursuant to specific lease terms. Through this structure, we believe that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Contingent and Unknown Liabilities. Contingent and unknown liabilities may include the following: • liabilities for environmental conditions; • claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation or acquisition transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation or acquisition transactions; • accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; • tax liabilities; and • claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. Overview of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our debt, interest and lease payments due by period as of December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands): Less than More than Contractual Obligations 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years Total Debt $ 213,869 $ 592,085 $ 1,593,035 $ 1,042,699 $ 3,441,688 Debt interest payments 13,861 38,126 74,416 58,775 185,178 Operating lease commitments 21,636 43,692 41,335 272,483 379,146 Construction commitments 31,713 57,042 — — 88,755 Total $ 281,079 $ 730,945 $ 1,708,786 $ 1,373,957 $ 4,094,767 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Standby Letters of Credit. As of December 31, 2006, we had provided approximately $22.1 million in letters of credit, of which $11.7 million was provided under the operating partnership’s $550.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees. Other than parent guarantees associated with the unsecured debt, as of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding guarantees in the aggregate amount of $48.2 million in connection with certain acquisitions. As of December 31, 2006, we guaranteed $26.8 million and $83.2 million on outstanding loans on two of our consolidated joint ventures and two of our unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2006, we guaranteed $87.3 million on outstanding property debt related to one of our unconsolidated joint ventures. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $11.4 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of our development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure, such as grading, sewers and streets. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promoted Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain of our joint venture partners 62 pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us. From time to time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments, pay promotes, or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES FFO. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. FFO is defined as net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate-related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non-recurring charges. We believe that FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do.

(2) The information for 2005 includes accumulated depreciation re-capture of approximately $1.1 million associated with the sale of the Interstate Crossdock redevelopment project. SS NOI. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider same store net operating income, or SS NOI, to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. For properties that are considered part of the same store pool, see Part I, Item 2: “Properties — Industrial Properties — Owned and Managed Market Operating Statistics”, Note 6, and “Owned and Managed Operating and Leasing Statistics — Owned and Managed Same Store Operating Statistics”, Note 2. In deriving SS NOI, we define NOI as rental revenues (as calculated in accordance with GAAP), including reimbursements, less straight-line rents, property operating expenses and real estate taxes. We exclude straight-line rents in calculating SS NOI because we believe it provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year-over-year comparison. In addition, we believe that SS NOI helps the investing public compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate as compared to other companies. While SS NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI also does not reflect general and administrative expense, interest expenses, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating SS NOI. 64 The following table reconciles SS NOI from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2006 2005 2004 Net income $ 224,072 $ 257,807 $ 125,471 Private capital income (46,102 ) (43,942 ) (12,895 ) Depreciation and amortization 177,824 161,732 136,610 Impairment losses 6,312 — — General and administrative 104,262 71,564 57,181 Other expenses 2,620 5,038 2,554 Fund costs 2,091 1,482 1,741 Total other income and expenses 26,178 57,044 119,727 Total minority interests’ share of income 62,855 74,777 52,863 Total discontinued operations (51,949 ) (127,498 ) (63,888 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (193 ) — — Net Operating Income (NOI) 507,970 458,004 419,364 Less non same store NOI (116,030 ) (70,782 ) (19,990 ) Less non-cash adjustments(1) (8,426 ) (9,861 ) (8,249 ) Cash basis same store NOI $ 383,514 $ 377,361 $ 391,125 (1) Non-cash adjustments include straight line rents and amortization of lease intangibles for the same store pool only. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimize the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2006, we had three outstanding interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $38.1 million (in U.S. dollars). See “Financial Instruments” below. The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before net unamortized debt discounts of $4.3 million as of December 31, 2006 (dollars in thousands): 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt(1) $ 155,384 $ 368,141 $ 152,151 $ 430,676 $ 288,835 $ 768,320 $ 2,163,507 Average interest rate 6.7 % 7.1 % 4.7 % 6.4 % 6.8 % 5.9 % 6.3 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 58,485 $ 22,604 $ 49,189 $ 854,543 $ 18,981 $ 274,379 $ 1,278,181 Average interest rate 5.9 % 6.6 % 6.8 % 3.1 % 3.8 % 4.9 % 3.8 % Interest Payments $ 13,861 $ 27,630 $ 10,496 $ 54,054 $ 20,362 $ 58,775 $ 185,178 (1) Represents 62.9% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 37.1% of all outstanding debt. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased or decreased by 10%, then the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $4.9 million (net of swaps) annually. As of December 31, 65 2006, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.4 and $3.5 billion, respectively, based on our estimate of current market interest rates. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, variable rate debt comprised 37.1% and 24.5%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $1.3 billion and $831.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non-functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2006 were three interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of our variable rate borrowings based on U.S. Libor (USD) and Euribor (Europe). The following table summarizes our financial instruments as of December 31, 2006 (in thousands): Maturity Dates Related Derivatives (in thousands) December 8, 2008 June 8, 2010 November 1, 2014 Notional Amount Fair Value Interest Rate Swaps: Plain Interest Rate Swap, Europe Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 9,655 $ 9,655 Receive Floating(%) 3MEURIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 3.72 % Fair Market Value $ 54 Plain Interest Rate Swap, USD Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 25,000 25,000 Receive Floating(%) 3MLIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 5.17 % Fair Market Value (130 ) Plain Interest Rate Swap, Europe Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 3,471 3,471 Receive Floating(%) 3MEURIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 4.26 % Fair Market Value (45 ) Total $ 38,126 $ (121 ) International Operations. Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside the United States is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity is located, mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The losses resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders’ equity and totaled $0.2 million for year ended December 31, 2006. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non-monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2006, losses from remeasurement and the sale of four foreign exchange agreements included in our results of operations totaled $0.8 million. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. 66",2023-12-30 18:36:08.913084
1045609,PLD,"Prologis, Inc.",2008,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements. We are a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust and expect that we have qualified, and will continue to qualify, as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes beginning with the year ended December 31, 1997. As a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, our own employees perform our corporate administrative and management functions, rather than our relying on an outside manager for these services. We manage our portfolio of properties generally through direct property management performed by our own employees. Additionally, within our flexible operating model, we may from time to time establish relationships with third-party real estate management firms, brokers and developers that provide some property-level administrative and management services under our direction. Management’s Overview The primary source of our revenue and earnings is rent received from customers under long-term (generally three to ten years) operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs. We also generate earnings from our private capital business, which consists of acquisition and development fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, and promoted interests and incentive distributions from our co-investment ventures. Additionally, we generate earnings from the disposition of projects in our development-for-sale and value- 37 Table of Contents added conversion programs, from the contributions of development properties to our co-investment ventures and from land sales. Our long-term growth is driven by our ability to: • maintain and increase occupancy rates and/or increase rental rates at our properties; • continue to develop properties profitably and sell to third parties or contribute to our co-investment ventures; and • continue to grow our earnings from our private capital business through the contribution of properties or from the acquisition of new properties. Real Estate Operations Real estate fundamentals in the United States industrial markets held steady during 2007 due to balanced supply and demand. According to data provided by Torto-Wheaton Research, availability was 9.4% for the quarter ended December 31, 2007, up 20 basis points from the prior quarter and unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2006. Activity levels were lower than the prior year. According to Torto-Wheaton Research, absorption was 21.4 million square feet for the fourth quarter and 120.2 million square feet for the full year, down from 209.3 million square feet in 2006, whereas construction completions were 40.3 million square feet in the quarter and 126.8 million square feet for the full year, down from 175.1 million square feet in 2006. While absorption in 2007 was 17.5% below the 19-year quarter average, construction completions were 22.6% below the average for the same period, which we believe indicates a market in equilibrium with a moderating supply of new industrial space entering the market. Reflecting the slowdown in the U.S. economy, we believe that net absorption for the first quarter of 2008 will be at or slightly below the fourth quarter 2007 level and similar in the second quarter of 2008. We presently expect pick-up in the second half of 2008 to a full year absorption level approximating that of 2007. With a similar moderation in deliveries, we believe that year-end vacancy will also approximate that of 2007. We think the strongest industrial markets in the United States are the major coastal markets tied to global trade, including Southern California — which is our largest market — Seattle, the San Francisco Bay Area, Northern New Jersey/New York and Miami. While we expect demand to moderate in the first half of 2008, due primarily to the slower growth rate in import volumes and the uncertainty in the economy, we believe our coastal markets will outperform other U.S. industrial markets. These markets have some of the highest occupancy rates in the country and we, therefore, expect to see some further rate growth in 2008, even as the national economic picture plays out. The table below summarizes key operating and leasing statistics for our owned and managed operating properties for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Total/Weighted Owned and Managed Property Data(1) The Americas Europe Asia Average For the year ended December 31, 2007: Rentable square feet 101,627,803 8,500,962 8,051,530 118,180,295 Occupancy percentage at period end(3) 96.0 % 96.1 % 96.6 % 96.0 % Same space square footage leased 18,144,411 405,912 690,569 19,240,892 Trailing four quarter rent change on renewals and rollovers(2)(3) 4.1 % 7.6 % 19.5 % 4.9 % For the year ended December 31, 2006: Rentable square feet 92,498,200 4,238,193 3,966,522 100,702,915 Occupancy percentage at period end(3) 96.3 % 98.1 % 89.6 % 96.3 % Same space square footage leased 15,968,855 42,334 192,391 16,203,580 Trailing four quarter rent change on renewals and rollovers(2)(3) (0.1 )% (0.1 )% 1.0 % (0.1 )% (1) Schedule includes owned and managed operating properties which we define as properties in which we have at least a 10% ownership interest, for which we are the property or asset manager, and which we intend to hold for the long-term. This excludes development and renovation projects and recently completed development projects available for sale or contribution. 38 Table of Contents (2) Rent changes on renewals and rollovers are calculated as the difference, weighted by square feet, of the net ABR due the first month of a term commencement and the net ABR due the last month of the former tenant’s term. If free rent is granted, then the first positive full rent value is used as a point of comparison. The rental amounts exclude base stop amounts, holdover rent and premium rent charges. If either the previous or current lease terms are under 12 months, then they are excluded from this calculation. If the lease is first generation or there is no prior lease for comparison, then it is excluded from this calculation. (3) On a consolidated basis for the Americas, Europe and Asia, occupancy percentage at period end for 2007 was 96.6%, 100.0% and 100.0%, and rent change on renewals and rollovers at period end for 2007 was 4.2%, 0.0% and 48.7%, respectively. On a consolidated basis, for the Americas, Europe and Asia, occupancy percentage at period end for 2006 was 97.0%, 98.1% and 100.0%, and rent change on renewals and rollovers at period end for 2006 was 4.2%, 0.0% and 0.0%, respectively. We believe that higher occupancy levels in our portfolio, driven in part by strengthening fundamentals in our markets tied to global trade, are contributing to rental rate growth in our portfolio. Our operating portfolio’s average occupancy rate in the fourth quarter of 2007 was 95.6%, on an owned and managed basis, an increase of 20 basis points from the prior quarter and 30 basis points from December 31, 2006. Rental rates on lease renewals and rollovers in our portfolio increased 4.9% in the fourth quarter of 2007, which we think reflect the generally positive trends in real estate fundamentals in our markets. During the quarter, cash-basis same store net operating income, with and without the effect of lease termination fees, grew by 3.3% and 4.8%, respectively, on an owned and managed basis. See “Supplemental Earnings Measures” below for a discussion of cash-basis same store net operating income and a reconciliation of cash-basis same store net operating income and net income. We believe that market rents have generally recovered from their lows and, in many of our markets, are back to or above their prior peak levels of 2001. Private Capital Business In June 2007, we announced the formation of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, our eleventh co-investment fund since our initial public offering in 1997. This Euro-denominated, open-end commingled fund is our tenth active fund. The fund’s investment strategy focuses on acquiring stabilized industrial distribution properties, including those developed by us, near high-volume airports, seaports and transportation networks, and in the major metropolitan areas of Europe, with initial target markets in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom and Central/Eastern Europe. The gross asset value of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS was approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2007. Going forward, we believe that our co-investment program with private-capital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for new investments. Through these co-investment ventures, we typically earn acquisition fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, as well as promoted interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the co-investment ventures; however, we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so. Through contribution of development properties to our co-investment ventures, we expect to recognize value creation from our development pipeline. In anticipation of the formation of future co-investment ventures, we may also hold acquired and newly developed properties for later contribution to future funds. As of December 31, 2007, we owned approximately 83.4 million square feet of our properties (56.5% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We may make additional investments through these co-investment ventures or new co-investment ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. Development Business Our development business consists of ground-up development, redevelopment, renovations, land sales, and value-added conversions. We generate earnings from our development business through the disposition or contribution of projects from these activities. We expect our development business to be a significant driver of our earnings growth as we expand the pipeline across each category. We believe that customer demand for new industrial space in strategic markets tied to global trade will continue to outpace supply. To capitalize on this demand, we intend to continue to expand our development business 39 Table of Contents in our existing markets and into new markets around the world that are essential to global trade. We also will continue to redevelop existing industrial buildings opportunistically by investing significant amounts of capital to enhance the functionality of the properties to meet current industrial market demands. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 2,535 acres of land for future development or sale, 91% of which is located in the Americas. We currently estimate that these 2,535 acres of land could support approximately 44.0 million square feet of future development. We believe that our historical investment focus on industrial real estate in some of the world’s most strategic infill markets positions us to create value through the select conversion of industrial properties to higher and better uses (value-added conversions). Generally, we expect to sell to third parties our value-added conversion projects at some point in the re-entitlement/conversion process, thus recognizing the enhanced value of the underlying land that supports the property’s repurposed use. Value-added conversions involve the repurposing of industrial properties to a higher and better use, including office, residential, retail, research & development or manufacturing. Activities required to prepare the property for conversion to a higher and better use may include such activities as rezoning, redesigning, reconstructing and retenanting. The sales price of the value-added conversion project is generally based on the underlying land value based on its ultimate use and as such, little to no residual value is ascribed to the industrial building. Our long-term capital allocation goal is to have approximately 50% of our owned and managed operating portfolio invested in non-U.S. markets based on owned and managed annualized base rent. As of December 31, 2007, our non-U.S. operating properties comprised 23.8% of our owned and managed operating portfolio and 4.5% of our consolidated operating portfolio based on annualized base rent. In addition to the United States, we include Canada and Mexico as target countries in the Americas. In Europe, our target countries currently are Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. In Asia, our target countries currently are China, India, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. We expect to add additional target countries outside the United States in the future, including countries in Central/Eastern Europe. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our on-going operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can. We must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital. Summary of Key Transactions in 2007 During the year ended December 31, 2007, we completed the following significant capital deployment and other transactions: • Acquired, on an owned and managed basis, 53 properties in the Americas, Asia and Europe aggregating approximately 11.9 million square feet for $1.0 billion, including 46 properties aggregating approximately 11.2 million square feet for $979.6 million through unconsolidated co-investment ventures and seven properties aggregating approximately 0.7 million square feet for $62.2 million acquired directly by us; • Committed to 38 new development projects and one value-added conversion project in the Americas, Asia and Europe totaling 12.2 million square feet with an estimated total investment of approximately $1.1 billion; • Acquired 1,441 acres of land for development in the Americas, Europe and Asia for approximately $281.2 million; • Sold seven development projects totaling approximately 0.5 million square feet plus three land parcels for an aggregate sale price of $115.1 million; • Formed an unconsolidated open-end co-investment venture, AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, with the contribution to the co-investment venture of $584.0 million (using the exchange rate on the date of contribution), aggregating approximately 4.7 million square feet of operating properties and completed development projects, and contributed an additional five completed development projects, aggregating 40 Table of Contents approximately 1.4 million square feet, for approximately $215.3 million during the year to this co-investment venture; • Contributed 10 completed development projects totaling 1.8 million square feet and two land parcels into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, AMB DFS Fund I, LLC, and AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., four of our unconsolidated co-investment ventures; • Divested three operating properties aggregating 0.3 million square feet and two value-added conversion projects for approximately $120.0 million; and • Exercised the purchase option for the remaining equity interest held by an unrelated third party member of AMB Pier One, LLC, which held the location of our global headquarters.

See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 5, 8 and 10 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. We also regularly review the impact of above or below-market leases, in-place leases and lease origination costs for acquisitions, and record an intangible asset or liability accordingly. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property-by-property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying value of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economics and market conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying value of our long-lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. For properties held for sale, impairment is recognized when the carrying value of the property is less than its estimated fair value net of cost to sell. As a result of leasing activity and the economic environment, we re-evaluated the carrying value of our investments and recorded impairment charges of $1.2 million, $6.3 million and $0.0, during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, on certain of our investments. Revenue Recognition. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an on-going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight-line rents, for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed. We also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customer’s occupancy. Property Dispositions. We report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by third-party investors for cash and are included in gains from disposition of real estate interests in the statement of operations. Second, we dispose of value-added conversion projects and build-to-suit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated 42 Table of Contents taxes, when applicable, and are included in development profits, net of taxes, within continuing operations of the statement of operations. Third, we dispose of value-added conversion and other redevelopment projects for which we may have generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable, in the development gains line within discontinued operations. Lastly, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, requires us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties, which is included in development gains and gains from dispositions of real estate, net of taxes and minority interests, in the statement of operations. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met. Co-investment Ventures. We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We determine consolidation based on standards set forth in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04-5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights, or FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). For co-investment ventures that are variable interest entities as defined under FIN 46 where we are not the primary beneficiary, we do not consolidate the co-investment venture for financial reporting purposes. Based on the guidance set forth in EITF 04-5, we consolidate certain co-investment venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. For co-investment ventures under EITF 04-5, where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, but where we exercise significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the co-investment venture for financial reporting purposes. Capitalized General and Administrative Expenses. We capitalize general and administrative expenses, related to development projects based on time spent on development activities. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the United States if we meet minimum distribution, income, asset and shareholder tests. However, some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable real estate investment trust subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as depreciation and gain recognition. However, we believe deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on a prospective basis, due to the re-evaluation of the accounting for our investment in the fund because of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the general partner’s rights effective October 1, 2006. As a result, our results of operations presented below are not comparable between years presented. The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. Same store pool includes all properties that are owned as of the end of both the current and prior year reporting periods and excludes development properties stabilized after December 31, 2005 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties that have been substantially complete for at least 12 months). As of December 31, 2007, same store industrial pool consisted of properties aggregating approximately 72.9 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2007 consisted of seven properties, aggregating approximately 0.7 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 31 properties, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. During 2007, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 32 43 Table of Contents properties, aggregating approximately 8.6 million square feet. In 2006, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 50 properties, aggregating approximately 7.5 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results. For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 (dollars in millions): For the Years Ended December 31, Revenues 2007 2006 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 553.3 $ 580.0 $ (26.7 ) (4.6 )% 2007 acquisitions 0.5 — 0.5 100.0 % 2006 acquisitions 10.0 10.4 (0.4 ) (3.8 )% Development 10.7 4.7 6.0 127.7 % Other industrial 11.2 7.6 3.6 47.4 % Non U.S. industrial 52.3 62.5 (10.2 ) (16.3 )% Total rental revenues 638.0 665.2 (27.2 ) (4.1 )% Private capital revenues 31.7 46.1 (14.4 ) (31.2 )% Total revenues $ 669.7 $ 711.3 $ (41.6 ) (5.8 )% U.S. industrial same store rental revenues decreased $26.7 million from the prior year due primarily to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on October 1, 2006 partially offset by rent increases on renewals and rollovers. Same store rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been $513.4 million if AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. had been deconsolidated as of January 1, 2006. The 2006 acquisitions consisted of 31 properties, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. The 2007 acquisitions consisted of seven properties, aggregating approximately 0.7 million square feet. The increase in rental revenues from development was primarily due to increased occupancy at several of our development projects where development activities have been substantially completed as well as an increase in the number of development projects. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated co-investment venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. The increase in other industrial revenues was primarily due to an increase in base rents. The decrease in revenues from non-U.S. industrial properties was primarily due to the contribution of 4.2 million square feet of operating properties and approximately 1.8 million square feet of completed development projects into AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS. The decrease in private capital income of 44 Table of Contents $14.4 million was primarily due to a decrease in incentive fees, acquisition fees, and disposition fees offset by an increase in asset management fees as a result of an increase in total assets under management.

Same store operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been $140.3 million if AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. had been deconsolidated as of January 1, 2006. The increase of approximately $12.5 million, had AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. been deconsolidated as of January 1, 2006, was primarily due to increased insurance costs, real estate taxes, roads and grounds expense, and management fees. The 2006 acquisitions consisted of 31 properties, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. The 2007 acquisitions consisted of seven properties, aggregating approximately 0.7 million square feet. The increase in development operating costs was primarily due to increased operations in certain development projects which have been substantially completed. This increase was primarily due to increases in real estate taxes and utilities. The increase in other industrial property operating costs was primarily due to insurance, cleaning and non-reimbursable expenses. The decrease in property operating costs from non-U.S. industrial properties is primarily due to the contribution of 4.2 million square feet of operating properties and approximately 1.8 million square feet of completed development projects into AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional staffing and the opening of new offices both domestically and internationally. The decrease of fund costs from the prior year is due primarily to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. The impairment losses during the year ended December 31, 2007 were taken on non-core assets as a result of leasing activities and changes in the economic environment. The impairment losses during the year ended December 31, 2006 were taken on several non-core assets as a result of leasing activities and changes in the economic environment 45 Table of Contents and the holding period of certain assets. Other expenses increased approximately $2.5 million from the prior year due primarily to an increase in dead deal expenditures. For the Years Ended December 31, Other Income and (Expenses) 2007 2006 $ Change % Change Development gains, net of taxes $ 124.3 $ 106.4 $ 17.9 16.8 % Gains from dispositions of real estate interests, net 73.4 — 73.4 100.0 % Equity in earnings of unconsolidated co-investment ventures, net 7.5 23.2 (15.7 ) (67.7 )% Other income 22.3 11.9 10.4 87.4 % Interest expense, including amortization (126.9 ) (165.1 ) (38.2 ) (23.1 )% Total other income and (expenses), net $ 100.6 $ (23.6 ) $ (124.2 ) (526.3 )% Development gains represent gains from the sale or contribution of development projects including land. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we sold seven completed development projects totaling 0.5 million square feet and three land parcels for approximately $115.1 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of $28.6 million. In addition, we contributed 15 completed development projects totaling 3.6 million square feet and two land parcels into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, AMB DFS Fund I, LLC, and AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., five of our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after-tax gain of $95.7 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed assets acquired by the third-party co-investors for cash. During 2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the co-investment venture partner’s share. During 2006, we also contributed a total of ten completed development projects into unconsolidated co-investment ventures. Four projects totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, three projects totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and one land parcel was contributed into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after-tax gain of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third-party investors for cash. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we contributed 4.2 million square feet in operating properties into AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, contributed a 0.2 million square foot operating property into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and contributed an operating property aggregating approximately 0.1 million square feet into AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, for a total of approximately $524.9 million. As a result of these contributions, we recognized gains from contribution of real estate interests of approximately $73.4 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed properties acquired by the third-party investors for cash. The decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated co-investment ventures of approximately $15.7 million was primarily due to a decrease in gains from the disposition of real estate by our unconsolidated co-investment ventures partially offset by the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. Other income increased approximately $10.4 million from the prior year due primarily to an increase in the gain on currency remeasurement of approximately $3.9 million, an increase in insurance proceeds of approximately $2.9 million related to losses from Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma and an increase in interest income of $2.3 million. The decrease in interest expense, including amortization, was due primarily to decreased borrowings on unsecured credit facilities and the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.

The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the then newly issued shares. On April 17, 2007, the operating partnership redeemed all 800,000 of its outstanding 7.95% Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 800,000 of its outstanding 7.95% Series K Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. In addition, on April 17, 2007, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all 510,000 of its outstanding 8.00% Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. As a result of the redemptions and repurchase, we recognized a reduction of income available to common stockholders of $2.9 million for the original issuance costs during the year ended December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all 840,000 of its outstanding 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 220,440 of its outstanding 7.75% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 201,139 of its outstanding 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 729,582 of its outstanding 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. As a result, we recognized a decrease in income available to common stockholders of $1.1 million for the original issuance costs, net of discount on repurchase.

The properties acquired during 2005 consisted of 29 properties, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2006 consisted of 31 properties, aggregating approximately 7.3 million square feet. The increase in rental revenues from development was primarily due to increased occupancy at several of our development projects where development activities have been substantially completed as well as an increase in the number of development projects. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have 47 Table of Contents been contributed to unconsolidated co-investment ventures, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. Non-U.S. industrial revenues increased approximately $21.1 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties in France, Germany, and Mexico. The increase in private capital income was primarily due to increased asset management and acquisition fees from additional assets held in co-investment ventures, which were partially offset by a decrease in incentive distributions of approximately $3.9 million. During 2006, we received incentive distributions of $22.5 million, of which $19.8 million was from AMB Partners II, L.P., as compared to incentive distribution of $26.4 million for the sale of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., during 2005.

The 2005 acquisitions consisted of 29 properties, aggregating approximately 6.9 million square feet. The 2006 acquisitions consisted of 31 properties, aggregating approximately 6.6 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to unconsolidated co-investment ventures, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. Non-U.S. industrial property operating costs increased approximately $5.7 million from the prior year due primarily to the stabilization of properties in Japan and the continued acquisition of properties in France, Germany, and Mexico. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate during the year. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock-based compensation expense as a result of higher values assigned to option and stock awards and executive departures, additional staffing and expenses for our international expansion, and the acquisition of AMB Blackpine. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co-investment ventures. The 2006 impairment loss was taken on several non-core assets as a result of leasing activities and changes in the economic environment and the holding 48 Table of Contents period of certain assets. Other expenses decreased approximately $2.4 million from the prior year due primarily to a decrease in losses associated with our deferred compensation plan and a decrease in certain deal costs. For the Years Ended December 31, Other Income and (Expenses) 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Development profits, net of taxes $ 106.4 $ 54.8 $ 51.6 94.2 % Gains from dispositions of real estate interests, net — 19.1 (19.1 ) 100.0 % Equity in earnings of unconsolidated co-investment ventures, net 23.2 10.8 12.4 114.8 % Other income 11.9 7.5 4.4 58.7 % Interest expense, including amortization (165.1 ) (147.5 ) 17.6 11.9 % Total other income and (expenses), net $ (23.6 ) $ (55.3 ) $ (31.7 ) (57.3 )% Development profits represent gains from the sale of development projects and land as part of our development-for-sale program. The increase in development profits was due to increased disposition and contribution volume during 2006. During 2006, we sold five land parcels and six development projects totaling approximately 1.3 million square feet for an aggregate sale price of $86.6 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of $13.3 million. In addition, during 2006, we received approximately $0.4 million in connection with the condemnation of a parcel of land resulting in a loss of $1.0 million, $0.8 million of which was the co-investment venture partner’s share. During 2006, we also contributed a total of ten completed development projects into unconsolidated co-investment ventures. Four projects totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Japan Fund I, L.P, two projects totaling approximately 0.8 million square feet were contributed into AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, three projects totaling approximately 0.6 million square feet were contributed into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and one land parcel was contributed into AMB DFS Fund I, LLC. As a result of these contributions, we recognized an aggregate after-tax gain of $94.1 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third-party investors for cash. During 2005, we sold five land parcels and five development projects, aggregating approximately 0.9 million square feet for an aggregate price of $155.2 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of $45.1 million. In addition, during 2005, we received final proceeds of $7.8 million from a land sale that occurred in 2004. During 2005, we also contributed one completed development project into an unconsolidated co-investment venture, AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after-tax gain of $1.9 million representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third-party co-investor for cash. The 2005 gains from disposition of real estate interests resulted primarily from our contribution of $106.9 million (using the exchange rate in effect at contribution) in operating properties to our then newly formed unconsolidated co-investment venture, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. The $12.4 million increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated co-investment ventures was primarily due to gains of $17.5 million from the disposition of real estate by our unconsolidated co-investment ventures during 2006. During 2005, such gains were $5.5 million. In addition, effective October 1, 2006, the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., resulted in an increase of approximately $5.1 million in equity in earnings of unconsolidated co-investment ventures. The increases in 2006 were partially offset by an increase in expenses by our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. The increase in other income was primarily due to increased bank interest income and an increase in property management income due to the expansion of our property management activities. The increase in interest expense, including amortization, was due primarily to increased borrowings on unsecured credit facilities and other debt.

During 2005, we divested ourselves of 18 industrial properties and one retail center, aggregating approximately 9.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $926.6 million, with a resulting net gain of $113.6 million. Included in these divestitures is the sale of the assets of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P., for $618.5 million. The multi-investor fund owned approximately 5.8 million square feet. We received cash and a distribution of an on-tarmac property, AMB DFW Air Cargo Center I, in exchange for our 21% interest in the fund. For the Years Ended December 31, Preferred Stock 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Preferred stock dividends $ (13.6 ) $ (7.4 ) $ 6.2 83.8 % Preferred unit redemption (issuance costs) discount (1.1 ) — 1.1 100.0 % Total preferred stock $ (14.7 ) $ (7.4 ) $ 7.3 98.6 % In December 2005, we issued 3,000,000 shares of 7.00% Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. In August 2006, we issued 2,000,000 shares of 6.85% Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. The increase in preferred stock dividends is due to the newly issued shares. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all 840,000 of its outstanding 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 220,440 of its outstanding 7.75% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units, all 201,139 of its outstanding 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 729,582 of its outstanding 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. As a result, we recognized a decrease in income available to common stockholders of $1.1 million for the original issuance costs, net of discount on repurchase. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, we use unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and common equity (issued by us and/or the operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our wholly-owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non-recourse, secured debt encumbering our wholly-owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes where practicable. In managing the co-investment ventures, in general, we use non-recourse, secured debt to capitalize our co-investment ventures. We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: • retained earnings and cash flow from operations; • private capital from co-investment partners; • net proceeds from contributions of properties and completed development projects to our co-investment ventures; • net proceeds from the sales of development projects, value-added conversion projects and land to third parties; • net proceeds from divestitures of properties; • proceeds from equity (common and preferred) or debt securities offerings; • borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities; • other forms of secured or unsecured financing; and • proceeds from limited partnership unit offerings (including issuances of limited partnership units by our subsidiaries). 50 Table of Contents We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will include: • working capital; • development, expansion and renovation of properties; • acquisitions; • debt service; and • dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred stock and limited partnership units. Cash flows. As of December 31, 2007, cash provided by operating activities was $240.5 million as compared to $335.9 million for the same period in 2006. This change is primarily due to changes in our assets and liabilities offset by gains from sales and contributions of real estate interests, net, and an increase in operating distributions received by unconsolidated co-investment ventures. Cash used in investing activities was $632.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to cash used for investing activities of $880.6 million for the same period in 2006. This change is primarily due to a decrease in cash used for property acquisitions, offset by additions to interests in unconsolidated co-investment ventures and additions to land and buildings. Cash provided by financing activities was $420.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to cash provided by financing activities of $483.6 million for the same period in 2006. This change is due primarily to an increase in payments on other debt, credit facilities, senior debt, the cost of repurchase of preferred units, and a decrease in proceeds from issuances of senior debt, and contributions from co-investment partners. This activity was partially offset by the issuance of common stock and increased borrowings on secured debt and credit facilities. We believe our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facilities and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Resources Development sales activity to third parties during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Number of completed development projects 7 6 5 Number of land parcels 3 5 5 Square feet 498,017 1,323,748 921,740 Gross sales price $ 130,419 $ 86,629 $ 155,206 Development gains, net of taxes $ 28,575 $ 12,440 $ 52,925 51 Table of Contents Development contribution activity during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Number of projects contributed to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. 4 3 — Square feet 1,006,164 554,279 — Number of projects contributed to AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC 2 2 1 Square feet 329,114 843,439 391,457 Number of land parcels contributed to AMB DFS Fund I, LLC 2 1 — Square feet — — — Number of projects contributed to AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS 8 — — Square feet 1,838,011 — — Number of projects contributed to AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. 1 4 — Square feet 469,627 2,644,258 — Total number of contributed development assets 17 10 1 Total square feet 3,642,916 4,041,976 391,457 Development gains, net of taxes $ 95,713 $ 93,949 $ 1,886 Property Divestitures. During 2007, we divested ourselves of three industrial properties, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $120.0 million, with a resulting net gain of approximately $2.0 million and a gain of approximately $60.0 million associated with the sale of two value-added conversion projects. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized development profits of approximately $95.7 million, as a result of the contribution of 15 completed development projects and approximately 82 acres of land to AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., AMB DFS Fund I, LLC, and AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. In addition, we recognized development profits of approximately $28.6 million as a result of the sale of seven development projects and 76 acres of land during the year ended December 31, 2007. Gains from Sale or Contribution of Real Estate Interests. During 2007, we contributed operating properties for approximately $524.9 million, aggregating approximately 4.5 million square feet, into AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. and AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC. We recognized a gain of $73.4 million on the contributions, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed properties acquired by the third-party investors for cash. During 2006, there were no comparable events. Properties Held for Contribution. As of December 31, 2007, we held for contribution to co-investment ventures 17 properties with an aggregate net book value of $488.3 million, which, when contributed, will reduce our average ownership interest in these projects from approximately 90% currently to an expected range of 15-20%. Properties Held for Divestiture. As of December 31, 2007, we held for divestiture five properties with an aggregate net book value of $40.5 million. These properties either are not in our core markets or do not meet our current investment objectives, or are included as part of our development-for-sale or value-added conversion programs. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. Properties held for divestiture are stated at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less costs to sell. Co-investment Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co-investment ventures with institutional investors. These co-investment ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund certain acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. We consolidate these co-investment ventures for financial reporting purposes when they are 52 Table of Contents not variable interest entities and when we are the sole managing general partner and control all major operating decisions. However, in certain cases, our co-investment ventures are unconsolidated because we do not control all major operating decisions and the general partners do not have significant rights under the EITF Issue No. 04-5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights. Third-party equity interests in the co-investment ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2007, we owned approximately 83.4 million square feet of our properties (56.5% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We may make additional investments through these co-investment ventures or new co-investment ventures in the future and presently plan to do so.

On June 30, 2007, we exercised our option to purchase the remaining equity interest held by an unrelated third party, based on the fair market value as stipulated in the co-investment venture agreement, in AMB Pier One, LLC, for a nominal amount. AMB Pier One, LLC, is a co-investment venture related to the 2000 redevelopment of the pier that houses our global headquarters in San Francisco, California. As a result, the investment was consolidated as of June 30, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, we also had an approximate 39.0% unconsolidated equity interest in G.Accion, a Mexican real estate company. G.Accion provides management and development services for industrial, retail, residential and office properties in Mexico. In addition, as of December 31, 2007, one of our subsidiaries also had an approximate 5% interest in IAT Air Cargo Facilities Income Fund (IAT), a Canadian income trust specializing in aviation-related real estate at Canada’s leading international airports. These equity investments of approximately $2.1 million and $2.7 million, respectively, are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. Common and Preferred Equity. We have authorized for issuance 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which the following series were designated as of December 31, 2007: 1,595,337 shares of series D cumulative redeemable preferred, of which none are outstanding; 2,300,000 shares of series L cumulative redeemable preferred, of which 2,000,000 are outstanding; 2,300,000 shares of series M cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding; 3,000,000 shares of series O cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding; and 2,000,000 shares of series P cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding. 54 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2007, $107.5 million in preferred units with a weighted average rate of 6.63% become callable in 2008. On April 17, 2007, AMB Property II, L.P., a partnership in which, as of January 1, 2008, AMB Property Holding Corporation, a Maryland corporation and our direct subsidiary, owns an approximate 1.0% general partnership interest and the operating partnership owns an approximate 92% common limited partnership interest, repurchased all 510,000 of its outstanding 8.00% Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units from a single institutional investor for an aggregate price of $25.6 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions. In connection with this repurchase, we reclassified all 510,000 shares of our 8.00% Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock as preferred stock. On April 17, 2007, the operating partnership redeemed all 800,000 of its outstanding 7.95% Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units from a single institutional investor for an aggregate price of $40.0 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions. In connection with this redemption, we reclassified all 800,000 shares of our 7.95% Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock as preferred stock. On April 17, 2007, the operating partnership redeemed all 800,000 of its outstanding 7.95% Series K Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units from a single institutional investor for an aggregate price of $40.0 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions.

On January 29, 2007, all of the outstanding 7.75% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units of AMB Property II, L.P. were transferred from one institutional investor to another institutional investor. In connection with that transfer, on February 22, 2007, AMB Property II, L.P. amended the terms of the series D preferred units to, among other things, change the rate applicable to the series D preferred units from 7.75% to 7.18% and change the date prior to which the series D preferred units may not be redeemed from May 5, 2004 to February 22, 2012. On November 1, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P., issued 1,130,835 of its class B common limited partnership units in connection with a property acquisition. In March 2007, we issued approximately 8.4 million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately $472.1 million, which were contributed to the operating partnership in exchange for the issuance of approximately 8.4 million general partnership units. As a result of the common stock issuance, there was a significant reallocation of partnership interests due to the difference in our stock price at issuance as compared to the book value per share at the time of issuance. We intend to use the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes and, over the long term, to expand our global development business. On September 21, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P., repurchased all 201,139 of its outstanding 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units from a single institutional investor for an aggregate price of $10.0 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions.

The series P preferred stock is redeemable by us on or after August 25, 2011, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, if any, to the redemption date. We contributed the net proceeds of approximately 55 Table of Contents $48.1 million to the operating partnership, and in exchange, the operating partnership issued to us 2,000,000 6.85% Series P Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. On December 13, 2005, we issued and sold 3,000,000 shares of 7.00% Series O Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at $25.00 per share.

On September 24, 2004, AMB Property II, L.P., issued 729,582 5.00% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a price of $50.00 per unit. The series N preferred units were issued to Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. in exchange for the contribution to AMB Property II, L.P of certain parcels of land that are located in multiple markets. Effective January 27, 2006, Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. exercised its rights under its Put Agreement, dated September 24, 2004, with the operating partnership, and sold all of the series N preferred units to the operating partnership for an aggregate price of $36.6 million, including accrued and unpaid distributions. Also on January 27, 2006, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of the series N preferred units from the operating partnership at an aggregate price of $36.6 million and cancelled all of the outstanding series N preferred units as of such date. On November 25, 2003, we issued and sold 2,300,000 shares of 63/4% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at $25.00 per share. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears at a rate per share equal to $1.6875 per annum. The series M preferred stock is redeemable by us on or after November 25, 2008, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, if any, to the redemption date.

On June 23, 2003, we issued and sold 2,000,000 shares of 61/2% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at a price of $25.00 per share. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears at a rate per share equal to $1.625 per annum.

We contributed the net proceeds of approximately $48.0 million to the operating partnership, and in exchange, the operating partnership issued to us 2,000,000 61/2% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. The operating partnership used the proceeds, in addition to proceeds previously contributed to the operating partnership from other equity issuances, to redeem all 3,995,800 of its 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units from us on July 28, 2003. We, in turn, used those proceeds to redeem all 3,995,800 of our 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $100.2 million, including all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, to the redemption date. In December 2005, our board of directors approved a two-year common stock repurchase program for the discretionary repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of $53.4 million at a weighted average price of $49.87 per share. We have the authorization to repurchase up to an additional $146.6 million of our common stock under this program. On December 18, 2007, we extended this program through December 31, 2009. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend over the long term to operate with an our share of total debt-to-our share of total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2007, our share of total debt-to-our share of total market capitalization ratio was 34.4%. (See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for our definitions of “our share of total market capitalization,” “market equity” and “our share of total debt.”) However, we typically finance our co-investment ventures with secured debt at a loan-to-value ratio of 50-65% per our co-investment venture agreements. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, our organizational 56 Table of Contents documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2007, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.5 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $4.2 million. Of the $1.5 billion of secured debt, $1.1 billion is secured by properties in our co-investment ventures. The secured debt is generally non-recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 1.1% to 9.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 5.6%) and final maturity dates ranging from January 2008 to February 2024. As of December 31, 2007, $1.0 billion of the secured debt obligations bear interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 6.3%, while the remaining $426.0 million bear interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 3.8%). On February 14, 2007, seven subsidiaries of AMB-SGP, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, which is one of our subsidiaries, entered into a loan agreement for a $305 million secured financing. On the same day, pursuant to the loan agreement, the same seven subsidiaries delivered four promissory notes to the two lenders, each of which matures on March 5, 2012. One note has a principal of $160 million and an interest rate that is fixed at 5.29%. The second is a $40 million note with an interest rate of 81 basis points above the one-month LIBOR rate. The third note has a principal of $84 million and a fixed interest rate of 5.90%. The fourth note has a principal of $21 million and bears interest at a rate of 135 basis points above the one-month LIBOR rate. As of December 31, 2007, the operating partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $1.0 billion in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.1% and had an average term of 4.2 years. The unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various covenants. The covenants contain affirmative covenants, including compliance with financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. We guarantee the operating partnership’s obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. The operating partnership has a $550.0 million (includes Euros, Yen, British pounds sterling or U.S. dollar denominated borrowings) unsecured revolving credit facility, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% at December 31, 2007. This facility matures on June 1, 2010. We are a guarantor of the operating partnership’s obligations under the credit facility. The line carries a one-year extension option and can be increased to up to $700.0 million upon certain conditions. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the operating partnership’s long-term debt rating, which was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2007, with an annual facility fee of 15 basis points. The four-year credit facility includes a multi-currency component, under which up to $550.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Euros, Yen or British pounds sterling. The operating partnership uses the credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2007, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2007, was $259.4 million and the remaining amount available was $273.8 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $16.8 million. AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, has a Yen-denominated unsecured revolving credit facility with an initial borrowing limit of 55.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect at December 31, 2007, equaled approximately $492.4 million U.S. dollars and bore a weighted average interest rate of 1.2%. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan, China and South Korea. Generally, borrowers under the credit 57 Table of Contents facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. The credit facility matures in June 2010 and has a one-year extension option. The extension option is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s long-term debt and was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2007. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s long-term debt, and was 15 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility as of December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2007, was $399.5 million in U.S. dollars. The credit agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. On July 16, 2007, certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and the operating partnership, each acting as a borrower, with us and the operating partnership as guarantors, entered into a fifth amended and restated revolving credit agreement for a $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility that replaced the existing $250 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The fifth amended and restated credit facility amends the fourth amended and restated credit facility to, among other things, increase the facility amount to $500 million with an option to further increase the facility to $750 million, to extend the maturity date to July 2011 and to allow for future borrowing in Indian rupees. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations for such subsidiaries and other entities controlled by the operating partnership that are selected by the operating partnership from time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant to our credit facility. Generally, borrowers under the credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility. The credit facility includes a multi-currency component under which up to $500.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Singapore dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling, and Euros with the ability to add Indian rupees. The line, which matures in July 2011 and carries a one-year extension option, can be increased to up to $750.0 million upon certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt, which was 60 basis points as of December 31, 2007, with an annual facility fee based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2007, the outstanding balance on this credit facility was approximately $217.2 million and bore a weighted average interest rate of 5.3%. The credit agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios by the operating partnership, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. On December 8, 2006, we executed a 228.0 million Euros facility agreement (approximately $303.3 million in U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at June 12, 2007, the date the facility was assumed by AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, as discussed below), which provides that certain of our affiliates may borrow either acquisition loans, up to a 100.0 million Euros sub-limit (approximately $133.0 million in U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at June 12, 2007), or secured term loans, in connection with properties located in France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Italy or Spain. On March 21, 2007, we increased the facility amount limit from 228.0 million Euros to 328.0 million Euros. Drawings under the term facility bear interest at a rate of 65 basis points over EURIBOR and may occur until, and mature on, April 30, 2014. Drawings under the acquisition loan facility bear interest at a rate of 75 basis points over EURIBOR and are repayable within six months of the date of advance, unless extended. We initially guaranteed the acquisition loan facility and were the carve-out indemnitor in respect of the term loans. In accordance with the terms of the facility agreement, on June 12, 2007, AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, assumed, and the operating partnership was released from, all of the operating partnership’s obligations and liabilities under the facility agreement. On June 12, 2007, there were 267.0 million Euros (approximately $355.2 million in U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at June 12, 2007) of term loans and no acquisition loans outstanding under the facility agreement. 58 Table of Contents The tables below summarize our debt maturities and capitalization and reconcile our share of total debt to total consolidated debt as of December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands): Our Co-investment Unsecured Secured Venture Senior Credit Other Total Debt(1) Debt(1) Debt Facilities(2) Debt Debt 2008 $ 199,970 $ 98,989 $ 175,000 $ — $ 13,408 $ 487,367 2009 25,799 122,671 100,000 — 873 249,343 2010 65,905 102,661 250,000 658,928 941 1,078,435 2011 115 189,420 75,000 217,177 1,014 482,726 2012 3,753 459,111 — — 61,093 523,957 2013 3,053 46,195 175,000 — 65,920 290,168 2014 3,216 4,102 — — 616 7,934 2015 3,387 18,806 112,491 — 664 135,348 2016 3,567 54,795 — — — 58,362 Thereafter 42,267 19,091 125,000 — — 186,358 Subtotal $ 351,032 $ 1,115,841 $ 1,012,491 $ 876,105 $ 144,529 $ 3,499,998 Unamortized premiums/(discount) 1,027 3,187 (9,368 ) — — (5,154 ) Total consolidated debt $ 352,059 $ 1,119,028 $ 1,003,123 $ 876,105 $ 144,529 $ 3,494,844 AMB’s share of unconsolidated co-investment venture debt(3) — 556,710 — — 36,368 593,078 Total debt(4) $ 352,059 $ 1,675,738 $ 1,003,123 $ 876,105 $ 180,897 $ 4,087,922 Co-investment venture partners’ share of consolidated debt(4) — (715,409 ) — — (100,000 ) (815,409 ) Our share of total debt(4) $ 352,059 $ 960,329 $ 1,003,123 $ 876,105 $ 80,897 $ 3,272,513 Weighted average interest rate 4.0 % 6.1 % 6.1 % 3.4 % 6.0 % 5.2 % Weighted average maturity (years) 2.4 4.1 4.2 2.7 4.6 3.6 (1) Our secured debt and co-investment venture debt include debt related to European and Asian assets in the amount of $62.0 million and $192.1 million, respectively, translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2007.

(4) Our share of total debt represents the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated or unconsolidated co-investment ventures holding the debt. We believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their co-investment ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the co-investment ventures.

As of December 31, 2007, we had $30.2 million in restricted cash. Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 of $0.50 per share of common stock, and the operating partnership announced its intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 of $0.50 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on January 7, 2008 to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 21, 2007.

The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to pay all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. 61 Table of Contents Capital Commitments Development starts, generally defined as projects where we have obtained building permits and have begun physical construction, during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 The Americas: Number of new development projects 26 16 Number of value-added conversion projects(1) 1 2 Square feet 7,427,914 5,428,642 Estimated total investment(2) $ 559,276 $ 356,843 Europe: Number of new development projects 6 4 Square feet 1,687,601 711,956 Estimated total investment(2) $ 220,200 $ 72,104 Asia: Number of new development projects 6 8 Square feet 3,060,335 4,283,572 Estimated total investment(2) $ 305,872 $ 485,344 Total: Number of new development projects 38 28 Number of value-added conversion projects 1 2 Square feet 12,175,850 10,424,170 Estimated total investment(2) $ 1,085,348 $ 914,291 Land acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 The Americas: Acres 1,231 774 Estimated build out potential (square feet) 21,083,750 11,974,941 Investment(3) $ 221,645 $ 199,785 Europe: Acres 182 — Estimated build out potential (square feet) 3,328,267 — Investment(3) $ 38,544 — Asia: Acres 28 61 Estimated build out potential (square feet) 997,537 3,506,843 Investment(3) $ 20,977 $ 93,429 Total: Acres 1,441 835 Estimated build out potential (square feet) 25,409,554 15,481,784 Investment(3) $ 281,166 $ 293,214 62 Table of Contents (1) Value-added conversion projects represent the repurposing of industrial properties to a higher and better use, including office, residential, retail, research and development or manufacturing. Activities required to prepare the property for conversion to a higher and better use may include such activities as rezoning, redesigning, reconstructing and retenanting. The sales price of the value-added conversion project is generally based on the underlying land value based on its ultimate use and as such, little to no residual value is ascribed to the industrial building(s).

As of December 31, 2007, we had 56 industrial projects in our development pipeline, which are expected to total approximately 17.8 million square feet and have an aggregate estimated investment of $1.7 billion upon completion. We have an additional 12 development projects available for sale or contribution totaling approximately 4.2 million square feet, with an aggregate estimated investment of $304.7 million. As of December 31, 2007, we and our co-investment venture partners have funded an aggregate of $1.2 billion and needed to fund an estimated additional $500 million in order to complete our development pipeline. The development pipeline, at December 31, 2007, included projects expected to be completed through the fourth quarter of 2009. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 2,535 acres of land for future development or 63 Table of Contents sale, approximately 91% of which is located in the Americas. We currently estimate that these 2,535 acres of land could support approximately 44.0 million square feet of future development. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on-tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from one to 55 years. These buildings and improvements subject to ground leases are amortized ratably over the lesser of the terms of the related leases or 40 years. Future minimum rental payments required under non-cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2007 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2008 $ 23,208 2009 22,632 2010 21,932 2011 21,577 2012 20,501 Thereafter 284,158 Total $ 394,008 Co-investment Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co-investment ventures with institutional investors. These co-investment ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2007, we had investments in co-investment ventures with a gross book value of $2.5 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and net equity investments in five significant unconsolidated co-investment ventures of $274.9 million and a gross book value of $4.4 billion. As of December 31, 2007, we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co-investment ventures of up to $151.0 million (using the exchange rates at December 31, 2007) pursuant to the terms of the co-investment venture agreements. From time to time, we may raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open-ended unconsolidated co-investment venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, which invests through a private real estate investment partnership, and for AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, an open-ended unconsolidated co-investment venture formed in 2007 with institutional investors. This would increase our obligation to make additional capital commitments to these funds. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and the management regulations of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, we are obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments to each fund until such time when our total equity commitment is greater than $150.0 million or 150.0 million Euros, respectively, at which time, our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely affect our cash flow. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd. (Arcata), which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our third-party policies. The captive insurance company is one element of our overall risk management program. We capitalized Arcata in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata may be adjusted based on this estimate. Like premiums paid to third-party insurance companies, premiums paid to Arcata may be reimbursed by customers pursuant to specific lease terms. Through this structure, we think that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Contingent and Unknown Liabilities. Contingent and unknown liabilities may include the following: • liabilities for environmental conditions; • claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our acquisition transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation or acquisition transactions; 64 Table of Contents • accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and • tax liabilities.

As of December 31, 2007, we had provided approximately $24.2 million in letters of credit, of which $16.8 million were provided under the operating partnership’s $550.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees and Contribution Obligations. Excluding parent guarantees associated with unsecured debt or contribution obligations as discussed in Notes 5 and 9, we had outstanding guarantees and contribution obligations in the aggregate amount of $405.2 million as described below. As of December 31, 2007, we had outstanding guarantees in the amount of $95.9 million in connection with certain acquisitions. As of December 31, 2007, we also guaranteed $41.2 million and $107.9 million on outstanding loans on five of our consolidated co-investment ventures and two of our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, respectively. Also, we have entered into contribution agreements with certain of our unconsolidated co-investment venture funds. These contribution agreements require us to make additional capital contributions to the applicable co-investment venture fund upon certain defaults by the co-investment venture of certain of its debt obligations to the lenders. Such additional capital contributions will cover all or part of the applicable co-investment venture’s debt obligation and may be greater than our share of the co-investment venture’s debt obligation or the value of our share of any property securing such debt. Our contribution obligations under these agreements will be reduced by the amounts recovered by the lender and the fair market value of the property, if any, used to secure the debt and obtained by the lender upon default. Our potential obligations under these contribution agreements are $160.2 million as of December 31, 2007. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2007, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $15.2 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of our development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promoted Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain of our co-investment venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us. From time to time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments, pay promotes, or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. 65 Table of Contents SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES Funds From Operations (“FFO”) and Funds From Operations Per Share and Unit (“FFOPS”). We believe that net income, as defined by U.S. GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, and FFO per share and unit, or FFOPS, to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. We define FFOPS as FFO per fully diluted weighted average share of our common stock and operating partnership units. We calculate FFO as net income, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate-related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non-recurring charges. We include the gains from development, including those from value-added conversion projects, before depreciation recapture, as a component of FFO. We believe that value-added conversion dispositions are in substance land sales and as such should be included in FFO, consistent with the real estate investment trust industry’s long standing practice to include gains on the sale of land in FFO. However, our interpretation of FFO or FFOPS may not be consistent with the views of others in the real estate investment trust industry, who may consider it to be a divergence from the NAREIT definition, and may not be comparable to FFO or FFOPS reported by other real estate investment trusts that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. In connection with the formation of a co-investment venture, we may warehouse assets that are acquired with the intent to contribute these assets to the newly formed venture. Some of the properties held for contribution may, under certain circumstances, be required to be depreciated under U.S. GAAP. If this circumstance arises, we intend to include in our calculation of FFO gains or losses related to the contribution of previously depreciated real estate to co-investment ventures. Although such a change, if instituted, will be a departure from the current NAREIT definition, we believe such a calculation of FFO will better reflect the value created as a result of the contributions. To date, we have not included gains or losses from the contribution of previously depreciated warehoused assets in FFO. AMB believes that FFO and FFOPS are meaningful supplemental measures of its operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, FFO and FFOPS are supplemental measures of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that exclude historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO and FFOPS, combined with the required U.S. GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO and FFOPS to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO and FFOPS can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO and FFOPS are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, these measures do not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO and FFOPS also do not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor are FFO or FFOPS necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. 66 Table of Contents The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts): 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Net income available to common stockholders(1) $ 295,524 $ 209,420 $ 250,419 $ 118,340 $ 116,716 Gains from sale or contribution of real estate, net of minority interests(2) (85,544 ) (42,635 ) (132,652 ) (47,224 ) (50,325 ) Depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 161,925 174,721 159,469 134,574 109,828 Discontinued operations’ depreciation 1,801 5,256 20,835 32,776 32,509 Non-real estate depreciation (5,623 ) (4,546 ) (3,388 ) (871 ) (720 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from consolidated co-investment ventures: Co-investment venture partners’ minority interests (Net income) 27,748 37,190 35,338 29,027 21,041 Limited partnership unitholders’ minority interests (Net income) 5,121 2,367 3,045 1,957 1,806 Limited partnership unitholders’ minority interests (Development gains) 7,148 4,948 2,262 435 344 Discontinued operations’ minority interests (Net income) 370 1,254 10,198 14,724 16,760 FFO attributable to minority interests (62,902 ) (82,861 ) (100,275 ) (80,192 ) (65,603 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from unconsolidated co-investment ventures: Our share of net income (7,467 ) (23,240 ) (10,770 ) (3,781 ) (5,445 ) Our share of FFO 27,391 16,038 14,441 7,549 9,755 Our share of development gains, net of taxes — — 5,441 — — Funds from operations $ 365,492 $ 297,912 $ 254,363 $ 207,314 $ 186,666 Basic FFO per common share and unit $ 3.60 $ 3.24 $ 2.87 $ 2.39 $ 2.17 Diluted FFO per common share and unit $ 3.51 $ 3.12 $ 2.75 $ 2.30 $ 2.13 Weighted average common shares and units: Basic 101,550,001 92,047,678 88,684,262 86,885,250 85,859,899 Diluted 104,168,707 95,444,072 92,508,725 90,120,250 87,616,365 (1) Includes gains from undepreciated land sales of $9.2 million, $5.6 million, $25.0 million, $3.7 million and $1.2 million for 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively. (2) The information for 2007 includes accumulated depreciation re-capture of approximately $10.1 million associated with the sale of two value-added conversion projects. The information for 2005 includes accumulated depreciation re-capture of approximately $1.1 million associated with the sale of one value-added conversion project. 67 Table of Contents SS NOI. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider same-store net operating income, or SS NOI, and cash-basis SS NOI to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. Properties that are considered part of the same store pool include all properties that were owned, or owned and managed, as the case may be, as of the end of both the current and prior year reporting periods and exclude development properties for both the current and prior reporting periods. The same store pool is set annually and excludes properties purchased and developments stabilized after December 31, 2005 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties that have been substantially complete for at least 12 months). In deriving SS NOI, we define net operating income as rental revenues, including reimbursements, less property operating expenses, both of which are calculated in accordance with GAAP. Property operating expenses exclude depreciation, amortization, general and administrative expenses and interest expense. In calculating cash-basis SS NOI, we exclude straight-line rents and amortization of lease intangibles from the calculation of SS NOI. We consider cash-basis SS NOI to be an appropriate and useful supplemental performance measure because it reflects the operating performance of our real estate portfolio excluding effects of non-cash adjustments and provides a better measure of actual cash-basis rental growth for a year-over-year comparison. In addition, we believe that SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI help the investing public compare our operating performance with that of other companies. While SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, they do not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI also do not reflect general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating these measures. The following table reconciles SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Net income $ 314,260 $ 224,072 $ 257,807 $ 125,471 $ 129,128 Private capital revenues (31,707 ) (46,102 ) (43,942 ) (12,895 ) (13,337 ) Depreciation and amortization 161,925 174,721 159,469 134,574 109,828 General and administrative 129,510 104,262 71,564 58,843 46,417 Fund costs 1,076 2,091 1,482 1,741 825 Impairment losses 1,157 6,312 — — 5,251 Other expenses 5,112 2,620 5,038 892 475 Total other income and expenses (100,577 ) 23,609 55,339 120,161 95,918 Total minority interests’ share of income 54,845 61,632 73,348 52,103 55,896 Total discontinued operations (71,702 ) (60,852 ) (134,180 ) (71,344 ) (80,344 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle — (193 ) — — — Net Operating Income (NOI) 463,899 492,172 445,925 409,546 350,057 Less non same store NOI (61,639 ) (104,147 ) (17,293 ) (22,725 ) (17,334 ) Less non-cash adjustments(1) (2,861 ) (9,502 ) (15,237 ) (13,085 ) (6,111 ) Cash basis same store NOI $ 399,399 $ 378,523 $ 413,395 $ 373,736 $ 326,612 (1) Non-cash adjustments include straight-line rents and amortization of lease intangibles for the same store pool only. 68 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimize the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2007, we had one outstanding interest rate swap with a notional amount of $25.0 million (in U.S. dollars). See “Financial Instruments” below. The table below summarizes the maturities and interest rates associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before net unamortized debt discounts of $5.2 million as of December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands): 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt(1) $ 255,780 $ 185,957 $ 418,873 $ 248,484 $ 449,570 $ 576,675 $ 2,135,339 Average interest rate 6.9 % 5.0 % 6.5 % 6.7 % 5.9 % 10.8 % 7.5 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 231,587 $ 63,386 $ 659,562 $ 234,242 $ 74,387 $ 101,495 $ 1,364,659 Average interest rate 2.1 % 5.9 % 3.4 % 3.6 % 5.6 % 9.8 % 3.9 % Interest Payments $ 22,582 $ 12,913 $ 49,868 $ 25,131 $ 30,675 $ 72,238 $ 213,407 (1) Represents 61.0% of all outstanding debt at December 31, 2007. (2) Represents 39.0% of all outstanding debt at December 31, 2007. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased or decreased by 10%, then the increase or decrease in interest cost on the variable rate debt would be $5.0 million (net of the swap) annually. As of December 31, 2007, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.5 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, based on our estimate of current market interest rates. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, variable rate debt comprised 39.0% and 37.1%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non-functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instrument in effect at December 31, 2007 was one interest rate swap hedging cash flows of variable rate borrowings based on U.S. Libor (USD). The following table summarizes our financial instruments as of December 31, 2007 (in thousands): Maturity Dates June 9, Notional Related Derivatives (In thousands) 2010 Amount Fair Value Notional Amount (U.S. dollars) $ 25,000 $ 25,000 Receive Floating(%) US LIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 5.17 % Fair Market Value $ (786 ) $ (786 ) Total $ 25,000 $ (786 ) International Operations. Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside the United States, other than Mexico, is generally the local currency 69 Table of Contents of the country in which the entity or property is located, mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The gains resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders’ equity and totaled $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non-monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. For the year ended December 31, 2007, unrealized and realized gains from remeasurement and translation included in our results of operations were $3.9 million.",2023-12-30 18:36:31.870033

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Please read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Management’s Overview Current Global Market and Economic Conditions Recent global market and economic conditions have been unprecedented, challenging and unpredictable with significantly tighter credit and declining economic growth through the fourth quarter of 2008. Continued concerns about the availability and cost of credit, declining real estate market and geopolitical issues have contributed to increased market volatility and decreased expectations for the global economy. In the fourth quarter, added concerns fueled by the failure of several large financial institutions and government interventions in the U.S. financial system led to increased market uncertainty and instability in the global capital and credit markets. These conditions, combined with declining business activity levels and consumer confidence and increased unemployment, have contributed to unprecedented levels of volatility. In light of this economic downturn, we are increasing our focus on our operations with a special emphasis on tenant retention and occupancy. Until the financial and real estate markets stabilize, we are limiting our acquisition and development activities to fulfilling prior commitments. We have realigned and streamlined internal resources as well as our overhead structure to meet the current and future needs of the business and have taken further steps to strengthen our capital and liquidity position. Our priorities are the strength of our balance sheet, controlling expenses and managing our business for the long term. Our goal is to do what we consider best for long-term value creation and enhancement of our net asset value. As we look forward, our objective is to emerge from this downturn in a competitive position to take advantage of opportunities as they arise, with our long term earnings capacity enhanced. Primary sources of revenue and earnings The primary source of our revenue and earnings is rent received from customers under long-term (generally three to ten years) operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs. We may also generate earnings from our private capital business, which consists of asset management fees and priority distributions, acquisition and development fees, and promote interests and incentive distributions from our co-investment ventures. Additionally, we may generate earnings from the contributions of development properties to our co-investment ventures, from the disposition of projects in our development-for-sale and value-added conversion programs and from land sales. We believe that our long-term growth will be driven by our ability to: • maintain and increase occupancy rates and/or increase rental rates at our properties; • raise third-party equity in our co-investment ventures and to grow our earnings from our private capital business from the acquisition of new properties or through the possible contribution of properties; and • develop properties profitably and sell to third parties or contribute to our select co-investment ventures. Focus on our balance sheet and cost structure To position ourselves to meet the challenges of the current business environment, we implemented a broad based cost reduction plan in the fourth quarter of 2008. As a result, we recognized a restructuring charge of approximately $12.3 million in the quarter, associated with severance, office closures and the termination of certain contractual obligations. About one-third of the restructuring charges were non-cash. As part of this plan, we reduced our total global headcount by approximately 22% as well as certain forecasted third-party expenditures. In executing these cost saving efforts, we believe that we have preserved our ability to serve our global customers and manage our operating portfolio. While we have removed excess capacity in our deployment teams, we believe that we have retained our key talent and left our global platforms intact. Cost reductions were also made to the back 45 Table of Contents office, support functions and third party costs, particularly those that related to our global expansion efforts in India and Poland. During the fourth quarter, we suspended our regular quarterly common stock dividend as we had met our 2008 REIT dividend distribution requirement. In addition, we aligned our 2009 regular quarterly dividend payments with the projected taxable income from recurring operations alone. Together, we believe these actions will improve our cash position by allowing us to retain $53.0 million of cash in the fourth quarter of 2008 and an additional $98 million over the course of 2009. We may make special distributions going forward, as necessary, related to taxable income associated with any asset dispositions and gain activity. We are currently exploring various options to monetize some of our development and operating assets, including asset sales and the formation of new joint ventures. On an owned and managed basis, we have properties available for sale or contribution with an estimated total investment upon completion of $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2008. We may use some or all of the proceeds from these transactions to decrease our debt obligations, but there can be no assurance that we will consummate any such transactions or use the proceeds to pay our debt obligations. Our liquidity position As a result of the current market conditions, the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads. Concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease to provide funding to businesses and consumers. We believe our current maturity schedule is well-laddered. As of December 31, 2008, our total consolidated debt maturities for 2009 were $782.6 million, excluding principal amortization. Assuming that we exercise available extension options, our total 2009 consolidated debt maturities would be $340.7 million, excluding principal amortization. Our total unconsolidated debt maturities for 2009 were $212.1 million as of December 31, 2008, excluding principal amortization. Assuming we exercise available extension options, our total 2009 unconsolidated debt maturities would be $173.4 million, excluding principal amortization. As of December 31, 2008, we had $710.2 million available for future borrowings under our three multi-currency lines of credit and had cash and cash equivalents of $223.9 million. While we believe that we have sufficient working capital and capacity under our credit facilities to continue our business operations as usual in the near-term, continued turbulence in the global markets and economies and prolonged declines in business and consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, as well as the liquidity and financial condition of our customers. If these market conditions persist in the long-term, they may limit our ability, and the ability of our customers, to timely replace maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs. If the long-term debt ratings of the operating partnership fall below current levels, the borrowing cost of debt under our unsecured credit facilities and certain term loans may increase. In addition, if the long-term debt ratings of the operating partnership fall below investment grade, we may be unable to request borrowings in currencies other than U.S. dollars or Japanese Yen, as applicable. However, the lack of other currency borrowings does not affect our ability to fully draw down under the credit facilities or term loans. While we currently do not expect the long-term debt ratings of the operating partnership to fall below investment grade, in the event that the ratings do fall below those levels, we may be unable to exercise our options to extend the term of our credit facilities or our $230.0 million secured term loan credit agreement, and the loss of our ability to borrow in foreign currencies could affect our ability to optimally hedge our borrowings against foreign currency exchange rate changes. In addition, based on publicly available information regarding our lenders, we currently do not expect to lose borrowing capacity under our existing lines of credit and as a result of a dissolution, bankruptcy, consolidation, merger or other business combination among our lenders. Our access to funds under our credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the lenders that are parties to such facilities to meet their funding commitments to us. If we do not have sufficient cash flows and income from our operations to meet our financial commitments and lenders are not able to meet their funding commitments to us, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. Certain of our third party indebtedness is held by our consolidated or unconsolidated joint ventures. In the event that our joint venture partner is unable to meet its obligations under our joint venture agreements or the third 46 Table of Contents party debt agreements, we may elect to pay our joint venture partner’s portion of debt to avoid foreclosure on the mortgaged property or permit the lender to foreclose on the mortgaged property to meet the joint venture’s debt obligations. In either case, we would face a loss of income and asset value on the property. In addition, a continued increase in the cost of credit and inability to access the capital and credit markets may adversely impact the occupancy of our properties, the disposition of our properties, private capital raising and contribution of properties to our co-investment ventures. If we are unable to contribute completed development properties to our co-investment ventures or sell our completed development projects to third parties, we will not be able to recognize gains from the contribution or sale of such properties and, as a result, our net income available to our common stockholders and our funds from operations will decrease. Additionally, business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns and other similar factors that affect our customers may adversely impact our business and financial condition. Furthermore, general uncertainty in the real estate markets has resulted in conditions where the pricing of certain real estate assets may be difficult due to uncertainty with respect to capitalization rates and valuations, among other things, which may add to the difficulty of buyers or our co-investment ventures to obtain financing on favorable terms to acquire such properties or cause potential buyers to not complete acquisitions of such properties. The market uncertainty with respect to capitalization rates and real estate valuations also adversely impacts our net asset value. In the event that we do not have sufficient cash available to us through our operations to continue operating our business as usual, we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity. Such alternatives may include, without limitation, divesting ourselves of properties, whether or not they otherwise meet our strategic objectives to keep in the long term, at less than optimal terms; issuing and selling our debt and equity in public or private transactions under less than optimal conditions; entering into leases with our customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms; or entering into lease renewals with our existing customers without an increase in rental rates at turnover. There can be no assurance, however, that such alternative ways to increase our liquidity will be available to us. Additionally, taking such measures to increase our liquidity may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our main financial covenants with respect to our credit facilities generally relate to fixed charge or debt service coverage, liabilities to asset value, debt to asset value and unencumbered cash flow. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with all of these covenants. There can be no assurance, however, that if the financial markets and economic conditions continue to deteriorate, that we will be able to continue to comply with our financial covenants. Impairment and restructuring charges We recognized charges in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to the valuation of our development program and reduction in personnel of approximately $219.5 million on an owned and managed basis ($218.0 million on a consolidated basis); these charges were almost entirely non-cash. The impairment charge on the assets under development and those available for sale or contribution on an owned or managed basis totaled approximately $100.7 million ($99.2 million on a consolidated basis), reflecting a 16% decline from the $617.4 million cost basis of the assets written down. The majority of the impairment charges related to assets in the Americas, with the remainder primarily in Europe. The impairment charge on the land inventory totaled approximately $94.7 million, reflecting a 34% decline from the $278.9 million cost basis of the land written down. These impairments were related to land inventory in the Americas. We also incurred approximately $11.8 million in charges for the write-off of pursuit costs related to development projects that we no longer plan to commence and reserves against tax assets associated with the reduction in development activity, as well as approximately $12.3 million of restructuring charges associated with severance, office closures and the termination of certain contractual obligations. An impairment charge is recognized when the book value of a property or land parcel is greater than its estimated fair value, based on the intended use and holding period. The intended use of an asset, either held for sale or held for the long term, can significantly impact how impairment is measured. If an asset is intended to be sold, impairment is determined using the estimated fair value. If an asset is intended to be held for the long term, impairment is recognized if undiscounted cash flows over the entire holding period, including a residual value, are less than the cost basis. We determined impairment based upon estimated fair market values which are consistent 47 Table of Contents with our business model to sell or contribute the assets we develop. When available, current market information was used to determine capitalization and rental growth rates. When market information was not readily available, the inputs were based on our understanding of market conditions and the experience of the management team, although actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. In a few instances, current comparative sales values were available and used to establish fair value. Additional impairments may be necessary in the future in the event that market conditions continue to deteriorate and impact the factors used to estimate fair value. We also utilized the knowledge of our regional teams and the recent valuations of our two open-ended funds, which contain a large, geographically-diversified pool of assets, all of which were subject to third-party appraisals at year end. In order to comply with disclosure requirements as outlined in SFAS No. 157, the designation of the level of inputs used in the fair value models must be determined. Inputs used in establishing fair value for real estate assets generally fall within level three, which are characterized as requiring significant judgment as little or no current market activity may be available for validation. The main indicator used to establish the classification of the inputs was current market conditions that, in many instances, resulted in the use of significant unobservable inputs in establishing fair value measurements. See Part IV, Item 15: Note 3 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a more detailed discussion of the real estate impairment losses recorded in our results of operations during the fourth quarter of 2008. Market price of our shares Recent global financial market and economic conditions have adversely impacted the market price per share of our common stock. Our market equity was $2.39 billion as of December 31, 2008, compared to $5.94 billion as of December 31, 2007. We define market equity as the total number of outstanding shares of our common stock and common limited partnership units multiplied by the closing price per share of our common stock at the relevant period end. The factors impacting the price per share of our common stock are discussed under the heading “Business Risks” in Part I, Item 1A of this report. Customer bankruptcies From a customer receivables standpoint, as of December 31, 2008, we believe that account receivables delinquency levels were consistent with our historical norms and we believe that we maintain adequate bad debt reserves. Although we believe that the number of bankruptcies of our customers increased during the fourth quarter of 2008, we believe the impact of such bankruptcies on our business was not significant for the year ended December 31, 2008. Our account receivables delinquencies may not continue at the same levels, our bad debt reserves may not be sufficient to cover such delinquencies as they occur and the level of customer bankruptcies may increase to levels that could be significant to our operations. Real estate operations Real estate fundamentals in the United States continued to weaken in the fourth quarter of 2008 as the national economy slowed further. We anticipate that the U.S. and global economies will decline further in 2009. Customer decision-making is prolonged, as commitments for new space are being eliminated or put on hold with only time critical leasing decisions being made. According to data provided by Torto Wheaton Research as of February 19, 2009, availability in the United States was 11.4% for the quarter ended December 31, 2008, up 70 basis points from the prior quarter and 200 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2007. Also, according to Torto Wheaton Research, absorption was negative 47.1 million square feet in the fourth quarter of 2008, and construction completions were 44.5 million square feet, down from 45.6 million square feet in the prior quarter. For 2008, absorption was negative 94.1 million square feet, the lowest since 2001. While we expect the delivery pipeline to decline substantially, we expect net absorption to be negative in 2009. We believe the strongest industrial markets in the United States continue to be the primary infill coastal markets tied to global trade. While demand has weakened notably across the U.S., due primarily to the weakening economy, we believe our coastal markets will continue to outperform other U.S. industrial markets. Outside the United States, while activity is moderating, we believe that we will continue to experience demand for our 48 Table of Contents distribution facilities due to the reconfiguration of supply chains and customer requirements for upgraded distribution space to modern facilities. The table below summarizes key operating and leasing statistics for our owned and managed operating properties for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007: Total/Weighted Owned and Managed Property Data(1) The Americas Europe Asia Average For the year ended December 31, 2008: Rentable square feet 111,379,838 9,802,487 10,325,794 131,508,119 Occupancy percentage at period end(2) 95.1 % 97.0 % 92.7 % 95.1 % Trailing four quarter same space square footage leased 17,452,675 421,051 513,354 18,387,080 Trailing four quarter rent change on renewals and rollovers(2)(3) 3.7 % (14.6 )% 4.0 % 3.1 % For the year ended December 31, 2007: Rentable square feet 101,627,803 8,500,962 8,051,530 118,180,295 Occupancy percentage at period end(2) 96.0 % 96.1 % 96.6 % 96.0 % Trailing four quarter same space square footage leased 18,144,411 690,569 405,912 19,240,892 Trailing four quarter rent change on renewals and rollovers(2)(3) 4.1 % 7.6 % 19.5 % 4.9 % (1) Schedule includes owned and managed operating properties which we define as properties in which we have at least a 10% ownership interest, for which we are the property or asset manager and which we currently intend to hold for the long-term. This excludes development and renovation projects and recently completed development projects available for sale or contribution. (2) On a consolidated basis, for the Americas, Europe and Asia, occupancy percentage at period end for 2008 was 94.8%, 90.8% and 90.0%, and trailing four quarter rent change on renewals and rollovers at period end for 2008 was 4.2%, n/a and 5.7%, respectively. On a consolidated basis, for the Americas, Europe and Asia, occupancy percentage at period end for 2007 was 96.6%, 100.0% and 100.0%, and trailing four quarter rent change on renewals and rollovers at period end for 2007 was 4.2%, n/a and 48.7% respectively. Properties in Europe are primarily held in the unconsolidated co-investment venture AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS. (3) Rent changes on renewals and rollovers are calculated as the difference, weighted by square feet, of the net annualized base rent (ABR) due the first month of a term commencement and the net ABR due the last month of the former customer’s term. If free rent is granted, then the first positive full rent value is used as a point of comparison. The rental amounts exclude base stop amounts, holdover rent and premium rent charges. If either the previous or current lease terms are under 12 months, then they are excluded from this calculation. If the lease is first generation or there is no prior lease for comparison, then it is excluded from this calculation. Although the economy continued to slow, we maintained strong occupancy levels at December 31, 2008 compared to September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007. Our owned and managed portfolio occupancy at December 31, 2008 was 95.1%, down from 95.4% at September 30, 2008 and 96.0% at December 31, 2007, while average occupancy was 94.9%, down from 95.0% at September 30, 2008 and 95.1% at December 31, 2007. During the three months ended December 31, 2008, rent on renewed and re-leased space in our operating portfolio increased 2.5% on an owned and managed basis, excluding expense reimbursements, rental abatements, percentage rents and straight-line rents. Rental rates on lease renewals and rollovers in our portfolio increased 3.1% for the trailing four quarters ended December 31, 2008. During 2008, cash-basis same store net operating income, with and without the effect of lease termination fees, grew by 4.0% and 0.2%, respectively, on an owned and managed basis. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements against the U.S. dollar, cash-basis same store net operating income without the effect of lease termination fees increased 2.3% during the year ended 49 Table of Contents December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, cash-basis same store net operating income, with and without the effect of lease termination fees, increased by 4.4% and 3.7%, respectively, on an owned and managed basis. See “Supplemental Earnings Measures” for a discussion of cash-basis same store net operating income and a reconciliation of cash-basis same store net operating income and net income. Development Business Our development business consists of conventional development, build-to-suit development, redevelopment, value-added conversions and land sales. We generate earnings from our development business through the disposition or contribution of projects from these activities. Despite the cyclical downturn in the U.S. and global economies, we believe that, over the long term, customer demand for new industrial space in strategic markets tied to global trade will continue to outpace supply, most notably in major gateway markets in Asia and Europe. To capitalize on this demand, we intend to opportunistically develop in many of our global markets that are essential to global trade. However, given the uncertainty in the global economy, we curtailed development activity, and as a result, development starts for the full year decreased 50% over 2007 with 69% of our 2008 development starts outside the United States. For 2009, our development activity will be limited to fulfilling prior commitments until the financial and real estate markets stabilize. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 2,503 acres of land for future development or sale, approximately 86% of which is located in North America, including 79 acres that are held in an unconsolidated joint venture. We currently estimate that these 2,503 acres of land could support approximately 45.1 million square feet of future development. Our long-term capital allocation goal is to have approximately 50% of our owned and managed operating portfolio invested in non-U.S. markets based on annualized base rent. We believe that our historical investment focus on industrial real estate in some of the world’s most strategic infill markets positions us to create value through the select conversion of industrial properties to higher and better uses (value-added conversions). Generally, we expect to sell to third parties these value-added conversion projects at some point in the re-entitlement/conversion process, thus recognizing the enhanced value of the underlying land that supports the property’s repurposed use. Value-added conversions involve the repurposing of industrial properties to a higher and better use, including office, residential, retail, research & development or manufacturing. Activities required to prepare the property for conversion to a higher and better use may include such activities as rezoning, redesigning, reconstructing and retenanting. The sales price of a value-added conversion project is generally based on the underlying land value, reflecting its ultimate higher and better use and as such, little to no residual value is ascribed to the industrial building. Due to dislocation in the housing industry, we do not believe that this is the optimal time to market certain value-added conversion projects, in particular, those intended to include a residential component. We remain committed to the viability of this development activity and believe that a well-timed approach to executing value-added conversion transactions will enhance stockholder value over the long term. Private Capital Business Since our initial public offering in 1997, we have formed eleven co-investment ventures and raised approximately $3.1 billion of private capital from third parties as equity in such co-investment ventures. Eight of these co-investment ventures are still active in the United States, Mexico, Europe and Japan: AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, AMB DFS Fund I, LLC, AMB-SGP, L.P., AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P., and AMB-AMS, L.P. We believe that our co-investment program with private-capital investors will continue to serve as a source of revenues and capital for new investments. Through these co-investment ventures, we typically earn acquisition fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, as well as promote interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the co-investment ventures; however, we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so. Through contribution of development properties to our co-investment ventures, we expect to recognize value creation from our development pipeline. In anticipation of the formation of future co-investment ventures, we may also hold acquired and newly developed properties for contribution to such future co-investment ventures. 50 Table of Contents Equityholders in two of our co-investment ventures, AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. and AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, have a right to request that the ventures redeem their interests under certain conditions. The redemption right of investors in AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. is currently exercisable, and as of December 31, 2008, this co-investment venture had $132.7 million of outstanding redemption requests based on the co-investment venture’s net asset value at December 31, 2008. The redemption right of investors in AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS is exercisable beginning after July 1, 2011. Although such redemption rights generally do not require the co-investment ventures to allocate newly acquired capital to cover redemption activity, there can be no assurance that such allocation will not occur and will not occur in such magnitude that will affect our contribution of properties to the ventures. While we have no obligation to fund redemption requests, we plan to meet our redemptions as cash becomes available through property sales, financings and new capital contributions. As of December 31, 2008, we owned approximately 78.7 million square feet of our properties (49.2% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures. We may make additional investments through these co-investment ventures or new co-investment ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. Given the current economic environment, however, the pace of new private capital commitments has slowed significantly. Summary of Key Transactions in 2008 During the year ended December 31, 2008, we completed the following significant capital deployment and other transactions: • Acquired, on an owned and managed basis, 21 properties in the Americas, Asia and Europe aggregating approximately 5.3 million square feet for $543.2 million, including 11 properties aggregating approximately 2.5 million square feet for $326.2 million through unconsolidated co-investment ventures and ten properties aggregating approximately 2.8 million square feet for $217.0 million acquired directly by us; • Committed to 23 new development projects in the Americas, Europe and Asia totaling approximately 7.4 million square feet with an estimated total investment of approximately $544.7 million; • Acquired 380 acres of land for development in the Americas, Europe and Asia for approximately $217.1 million; • Sold development projects aggregating approximately 0.2 million square feet, including 0.1 million square feet that was held in an unconsolidated co-investment venture, and one seven-acre parcel of land that was held in an unconsolidated co-investment venture, for an aggregate sale price of $83.8 million; • Contributed eleven completed development projects aggregating approximately 5.2 million square feet to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, and AMB Japan Fund I, L.P., all unconsolidated co-investment ventures; • On June 13, 2008, acquired approximately 19% and, on July 18, 2008, acquired the remaining equity interest (approximately 42%) in G.

See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 6, 9 and 11 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate and leasehold interests are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, an adjustment to the carrying value of the property is made to reduce it to its estimated fair value. We also regularly review the impact of above or below-market leases, in-place leases and lease origination costs for acquisitions, and record an intangible asset or liability accordingly. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property-by-property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable. When the carrying value of a property or land parcel is greater than its estimated fair value, based on the intended use and holding period, an impairment charge to earnings is recognized for the excess over its estimated fair value less costs to sell. The intended use of an asset, either held for sale or held for the long term, can significantly impact how impairment is measured. If an asset is intended to be held for the long term, the impairment 52 Table of Contents analysis is based on a two-step test. The first test measures estimated expected future cash flows over the holding period, including a residual value (undiscounted and without interest charges), against the carrying value of the property. If the asset fails the test, then the asset carrying value is measured against the lower of cost or the present value of expected cash flows over the expected hold period. An impairment charge to earnings is recognized for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over the lower of cost or the present values of expected cash flows over the expected hold period. If an asset is intended to be sold, impairment is determined using the estimated fair value less costs to sell. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economic and market conditions and the availability of capital. We determine the estimated fair values based on our assumptions regarding rental rates, costs to complete, lease-up and holding periods, as well as sales prices or contribution values. When available, current market information was used to determine capitalization and rental growth rates. When market information was not readily available, the inputs were based on our understanding of market conditions and the experience of the management team. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. The discount rates used in the fair value estimates ranged from 8-11% and represent a rate commensurate with the indicated holding period with a premium layered on for risk. In a few instances, current comparative sales values were available and used to establish fair value. We also utilize the knowledge of our regional teams and the recent valuations of our two open-ended funds, which contain a large, geographically diversified pool of assets, all of which are subject to third-party appraisals at year end. Revenue Recognition. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an on-going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight-line rents, for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed. We also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customer’s occupancy. Property Dispositions. We report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by third-party investors for cash and are included in gains from sale or contribution of real estate interests in the statement of operations. Second, we dispose of value-added conversion projects and build-to-suit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable, and are included in development profits, net of taxes, within continuing operations of the statement of operations. Third, we dispose of value-added conversion and other redevelopment projects for which we may have generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable, in the development gains line within discontinued operations. Lastly, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, requires us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties, which is included in development gains and gains from dispositions of real estate, net of taxes and minority interests, in the statement of operations. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met. Joint Ventures. We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We determine consolidation based on standards set forth in FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities — An Interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46) or EITF Issue No. 04-5 (EITF 04-5), Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the 53 Table of Contents Limited Partners Have Certain Rights and SOP 78-9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures. For joint ventures that are variable interest entities as defined under FIN 46 where we are not the primary beneficiary, we do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. Based on the guidance set forth in EITF 04-5, we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. We are the general partner (or equivalent of a general partner in entities not structured as partnerships) in a number of our consolidated joint venture investments. In all such cases, the limited partners in such investments (or equivalent of limited partners in such investments which are not structured as partnerships) do not have rights described in EITF 04-5, which would preclude consolidation. We consolidate certain other joint ventures where we are not the general partner (or equivalent of a general partner in entities not structured as partnerships) because we have control over those entities through majority ownership, retention of the majority of economics, and a combination of substantive kick-out rights and/or substantive participating rights. For joint ventures under EITF 04-5 where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, but where we exercise significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. In such unconsolidated joint ventures, either we are not the general partner (or general partner equivalent) and do not hold sufficient capital or any rights that would require consolidation or, alternatively, we are the general partner (or the general partner equivalent) and the other partners (or equivalent) hold substantive participating rights that override the presumption of control. Based on the guidance set forth in EITF 04-5, we consolidate certain co-investment venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. For co-investment ventures under EITF 04-5, where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, but where we exercise significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the co-investment venture for financial reporting purposes. Capitalized General and Administrative Expenses. In conformity with SFAS No. 67, Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects, we capitalize costs, such as general and administrative expenses that are directly related to our development projects, based on time spent on development activities. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the United States if we meet minimum distribution requirements, and certain income, asset and share ownership tests. However, some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable real estate investment trust subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as depreciation and gain recognition. However, we believe the net deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet. Foreign Currency Remeasurement and Translation. Transactions that require the remeasurement and translation of a foreign currency are recorded according to the guidance set forth in SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries formed in the United States, Mexico and certain subsidiaries in Europe. Other than Mexico and certain subsidiaries in Europe, the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside the United States is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity or property is located, mitigating the effect of currency exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. In these instances, non-monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional 54 Table of Contents currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. The same store pool includes all properties that are owned as of the end of both the current and prior year reporting periods and excludes development properties stabilized after December 31, 2006 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties that have been substantially complete for at least 12 months). As of December 31, 2008, the same store industrial pool consisted of properties aggregating approximately 65.0 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results. For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Acquired: Number of properties 10 7 31 Square feet (in thousands) 2,831 702 6,595 Acquisition cost (in thousands) $ 217,044 $ 62,241 $ 568,369 Sold or Contributed: Number of properties 19 32 50 Square feet (in thousands) 5,274 8,600 7,500 For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 (dollars in millions): For the Years Ended December 31, Revenues 2008 2007 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 534.1 $ 569.5 $ (35.4 ) (6.2 )% 2008 acquisitions 0.2 — 0.2 100.0 % 2007 acquisitions 1.4 0.5 0.9 180.0 % Development 9.1 8.6 0.5 5.8 % Other industrial 16.8 8.7 8.1 93.1 % Non-U.S. industrial 85.0 52.3 32.7 62.5 % Total rental revenues 646.6 639.6 7.0 1.1 % Private capital revenues 68.4 31.7 36.7 115.6 % Total revenues $ 715.0 $ 671.3 $ 43.7 6.5 % U.S. industrial same store rental revenues decreased $35.4 million from the prior year primarily due to the decrease of $40.6 million in same store revenues from the contribution of the interests in AMB Partners II, L.P. (previously, a consolidated co-investment venture) to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an unconsolidated co-investment venture, on July 1, 2008. Same store rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 would have been $574.7 million if the interests in AMB Partners II, L.P. had not been contributed as of December 31, 2008. The decrease of $40.6 million related to the contribution of interests in AMB Partners II, L.P. was offset by an increase of $5.2 million, primarily due to increased rates and decreases in free rent. The increase in rental revenues from development of $0.5 million was primarily due to increased occupancy at several of our development projects. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from development projects that have reached certain levels of operation but are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. The increase in these revenues of 55 Table of Contents $8.1 million reflects the number of projects that have reached these levels of operation and higher rent levels during 2008. The increase in revenues from non-U.S. industrial properties of $32.7 million was primarily due to the acquisition of 2.4 million square feet of operating properties during 2008 as well as an increase in square footage leased at our completed development properties. The increase in private capital revenues of $36.7 million was primarily due to the receipt of an incentive distribution of $33.0 million for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an incentive distribution of $1.0 million in connection with the sale of the partnership interests in AMB/Erie, L.P., including its final real estate asset to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and an increase in asset management fees as a result of an increase in total unconsolidated assets under management, partially offset by a decrease in acquisition fees.

(previously, a consolidated co-investment venture) to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an unconsolidated co-investment venture, on July 1, 2008. The decrease of $3.5 million, excluding the effect of the AMB Partners II, L.P. contribution, was primarily due to decreased repairs and maintenance expense as well as decreases in real estate taxes and insurance expense. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to unconsolidated co-investment ventures, which are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation but are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. The decrease in these costs of $2.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily due to the decrease in our development-start and acquisition activities. Development starts for the full year 2008 totaled $544.7 million, a 50 percent decrease from $1.1 billion in 2007. The decrease was partially offset by the contribution of one operating property totaling 0.8 million square feet during 2008. The increase in property operating costs for non-U.S. industrial properties of $28.1 million was primarily due to the acquisition of 2.4 million square feet of operating properties during 2008, as well as an increase in square footage leased at our completed development properties. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $6.8 million was primarily due to the recognition of $4.3 million of depreciation expense resulting from 56 Table of Contents the reclassification of $76.7 million from properties held for contribution to investments in real estate. The increase in general and administrative expenses of $14.5 million was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs, resulting from increased employee headcount in the first three quarters of 2008 as well as an increase in professional services, and taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $12.3 million in restructuring charges due to the implementation of a broad-based cost reduction plan, which included a reduction in global headcount, office closure costs and the termination of certain contractual obligations. The increase in real estate impairment losses was primarily a result of changes in the economic environment in addition to the write-off of pursuit costs. See Part IV, Item 15: Note 3 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a more detailed discussion of the real estate impairment losses recorded in our results of operations during the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in other expenses of $4.6 million was primarily due to a loss on our non-qualified deferred compensation plans during the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to a gain during the year ended December 31, 2007.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we contributed an operating property for approximately $66.2 million, aggregating approximately 0.8 million square feet, into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. As a result, we recognized a gain of $20.0 million on the contribution, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third-party investors for cash. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we contributed 4.2 million square feet in operating properties into AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, contributed a 0.2 million square foot operating property into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and contributed an operating property aggregating approximately 0.1 million square feet into AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, for a total of approximately $524.9 million. As a result of these contributions, we recognized gains from the contribution of real estate interests of approximately $73.4 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed properties acquired by the third-party investors for cash. The increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures of $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 was primarily due to the contribution of the interests in AMB Partners II, L.P. (previously, a consolidated co-investment venture) to AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an unconsolidated co-investment venture, as well as growth in our unconsolidated assets under management. Other (expense) income decreased $25.4 million from the prior year primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate loss, a loss on our non qualified deferred compensation plan of $7.8 million, the recognition of a $5.5 million loss on impairment of an investment and a decrease in interest income of approximately $3.3 million, partially offset by an increase in third party management fees. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized a gain on currency remeasurement of approximately $3.1 million, compared to a loss of approximately $5.7 million in 2008. Additionally, other income during the year ended December 31, 2007 included insurance proceeds of approximately $2.9 million related to losses from Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma. Interest expense increased $6.6 million as result of increased total consolidated debt at December 31, 2008. 57 Table of Contents For the Years Ended December 31, Discontinued Operations 2008 2007 $ Change % Change (Loss) income attributable to discontinued operations, net of minority interests $ (0.4 ) $ 8.9 $ (9.3 ) (104.5 )% Development gains and gains from sale of real estate interests, net of taxes and minority interests 1.9 62.0 (60.1 ) (97.0 )% Total discontinued operations $ 1.5 $ 70.9 $ (69.4 ) (97.9 )% During the year ended December 31, 2008, we sold an approximate 0.1 million square foot industrial operating property for a sale price of $3.6 million, with a resulting net gain of $0.7 million, and also recognized a deferred gain of approximately $1.1 million on the divestiture of one industrial building, aggregating approximately 0.1 million square feet, for a price of $3.5 million, which was disposed of on December 31, 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we divested ourselves of three industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $120.0 million, with a resulting net gain of $2.0 million, and two value-added conversion projects resulting in a gain of approximately $60.0 million.

In addition, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all 510,000 of its outstanding 8.00% Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units. As a result of the redemptions and repurchase, we recognized a reduction of income available to common stockholders of $2.9 million for the original issuance costs during the year ended December 31, 2007. No repurchases were made during the year ended December 31, 2008. 58 Table of Contents For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 (dollars in millions): Effective October 1, 2006, we deconsolidated AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on a prospective basis, due to the re-evaluation of the accounting for our investment in the fund because of changes to the partnership agreement regarding the general partner’s rights effective October 1, 2006. As a result, our results of operations presented below are not comparable between years presented. For the Years Ended December 31, Revenues 2007 2006 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 569.5 $ 595.5 $ (26.0 ) (4.4 )% 2007 acquisitions 0.5 — 0.5 100.0 % Development 8.6 2.9 5.7 196.6 % Other industrial 8.7 5.3 3.4 64.2 % Non-U.S. industrial 52.3 62.6 (10.3 ) (16.5 )% Total rental revenues 639.6 666.3 (26.7 ) (4.0 )% Private capital revenues 31.7 46.1 (14.4 ) (31.2 )% Total revenues $ 671.3 $ 712.4 $ (41.1 ) (5.8 )% U.S. industrial same store rental revenues decreased $26.0 million from the prior year due primarily to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on October 1, 2006. Same store rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been $542.1 million if AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. had been deconsolidated as of January 1, 2006. The increase of $27.4 million, excluding the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., is primarily due to increased occupancy, rent increases on renewals and rollovers as well as decreases in free rent. The 2007 acquisitions consisted of seven properties, aggregating approximately 0.7 million square feet. The increase in rental revenues from development was primarily due to increased occupancy at several of our development projects where development activities have been substantially completed as well as an increase in the number of development projects. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated co-investment venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. The increase in other industrial revenues was primarily due to an increase in base rents. The decrease in revenues from non-U.S. industrial properties was primarily due to the contribution of 4.2 million square feet of operating properties and approximately 1.8 million square feet of completed development projects into AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS. The decrease in private capital income of $14.4 million was primarily due to a decrease in incentive fees, acquisition fees, and disposition fees offset by an increase in asset management fees as a result of an increase in total assets under management. 59 Table of Contents For the Years Ended December 31, Costs and Expenses 2007 2006 $ Change % Change Property operating costs: Rental expenses $ 99.2 $ 96.3 $ 2.9 3.0 % Real estate taxes 75.2 76.9 (1.7 ) (2.2 )% Total property operating costs $ 174.4 $ 173.2 $ 1.2 0.7 % Property operating costs U.S. industrial: Same store $ 162.4 $ 158.4 $ 4.0 2.5 % 2007 acquisitions 1.8 — 1.8 100.0 % Development 4.8 2.8 2.0 71.4 % Other industrial 8.8 0.1 8.7 N/A Non-U.S. industrial (3.4 ) 11.9 (15.3 ) (128.6 )% Total property operating costs 174.4 173.2 1.2 0.7 % Depreciation and amortization 162.3 175.4 (13.1 ) (7.5 )% General and administrative 129.5 104.3 25.2 24.2 % Fund costs 1.1 2.1 (1.0 ) (48.5 )% Real estate impairment losses 1.2 6.3 (5.2 ) (81.7 )% Other expenses 5.1 2.6 2.5 95.1 % Total costs and expenses $ 473.6 $ 463.9 $ 9.6 2.1 % Same store properties’ operating expenses increased $4.0 million from the prior year, despite a decrease of approximately $12.7 million due to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., on October 1, 2006. Same store operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 would have been $145.7 million if AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. had been deconsolidated as of January 1, 2006. The increase of approximately $16.7 million, had AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. been deconsolidated as of January 1, 2006, was primarily due to increased insurance costs, real estate taxes, roads and grounds expense, and management fees. The 2007 acquisitions consisted of seven properties, aggregating approximately 0.7 million square feet. The increase in development operating costs was primarily due to increased operations in certain development projects which have been substantially completed. This increase was primarily due to increases in real estate taxes and utilities. The increase in other industrial property operating costs was primarily due to insurance, cleaning and non-reimbursable expenses. The decrease in property operating costs from non-U.S. industrial properties is primarily due to the contribution of 4.2 million square feet of operating properties and approximately 1.8 million square feet of completed development projects into AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional staffing and the opening of new offices both domestically and internationally. The decrease of fund costs from the prior year was due primarily to the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. The impairment losses during the year ended December 31, 2007 were taken on non-core assets as a result of leasing activities and changes in the economic environment. The impairment losses during the year ended December 31, 2006 were taken on several non-core assets as a result of leasing activities and changes in the economic environment and the holding period of certain assets. Other expenses increased approximately $2.5 million from the prior year due primarily to an increase in dead deal expenditures. 60 Table of Contents For the Years Ended December 31, Other Income and (Expenses) 2007 2006 $ Change % Change Development profits, net of taxes $ 124.3 $ 106.4 $ 17.9 16.8 % Gains from sale or contribution of real estate interests, net 73.4 — 73.4 100.0 % Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures, net 7.5 23.2 (15.8 ) (67.9 )% Other income 22.3 11.8 10.4 88.4 % Interest expense, including amortization (127.0 ) (161.4 ) (34.5 ) (21.4 )% Total other income and (expenses), net $ 100.5 $ (20.0 ) $ 120.5 602.1 % Development profits, net of taxes, represent gains from the sale or contribution of development projects including land.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, we contributed 4.2 million square feet in operating properties into AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, contributed a 0.2 million square foot operating property into AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and contributed an operating property aggregating approximately 0.1 million square feet into AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, for a total of approximately $524.9 million. As a result of these contributions, we recognized gains from contribution of real estate interests of approximately $73.4 million, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed properties acquired by the third-party investors for cash. The decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures of approximately $15.8 million was primarily due to a decrease in gains from the sale of real estate interests by our unconsolidated joint ventures partially offset by the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. Other income increased approximately $10.4 million from the prior year due primarily to an increase in the gain on currency remeasurement of approximately $3.9 million, an increase in insurance proceeds of approximately $2.9 million related to losses from Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma and an increase in interest income of $2.3 million. The decrease in interest expense, including amortization, was due primarily to decreased borrowings on unsecured credit facilities and the deconsolidation of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P.

As a result, we recognized a decrease in income available to common stockholders of $1.1 million for the original issuance costs, net of discount on repurchase. Liquidity and Capital Resources Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, we use unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and common equity (issued by us and/or the operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our wholly-owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non-recourse, secured debt encumbering our wholly-owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes where practicable. In managing the co-investment ventures, in general, we use non-recourse, secured debt to capitalize our co-investment ventures. We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for debt service, development, acquisitions, expansion and renovation of properties will include: • cash on hand and cash flow from operations; • private capital from co-investment partners; • net proceeds from contributions of properties and completed development projects to our co-investment ventures; • net proceeds from the sales of development projects, value-added conversion projects and land to third parties; • net proceeds from divestitures of properties; • borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities; • other forms of secured or unsecured financing; • assumption of debt related to acquired properties; • proceeds from limited partnership unit offerings (including issuances of limited partnership units by our subsidiaries); and • proceeds from equity (common and preferred) or debt securities offerings. We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will include: • debt service; • development, expansion and renovation of properties; • acquisitions; • dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred stock and limited partnership units; and • working capital. 62 Table of Contents To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income. While historically we have satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to our stockholders, we may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, our own stock. As a result of this distribution requirement, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our on-going operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can. We may need to continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. If the long-term debt ratings of the operating partnership fall below its current levels, the borrowing cost of debt under our unsecured credit facilities and certain term loans will increase. In addition, if the long-term debt ratings of the operating partnership fall below investment grade, we may be unable to request borrowings in currencies other than U.S. dollars or Japanese Yen, as applicable, however, the lack of other currency borrowings does not affect our ability to fully draw down under the credit facilities or term loans. In the event the long-term debt ratings of the operating partnership fall below investment grade, we may be unable to exercise our options to extend the term of our credit facilities or our $230 million secured term loan credit agreement. However, our lenders will not be able to terminate our credit facilities or certain term loans in the event that the operating partnership’s credit rating falls below investment grade status. None of our credit facilities or such term loans contains covenants regarding our stock price or market capitalization, thus a decrease in our stock price is not expected to impact our ability to borrow under our existing lines of credit and term loans. Based on publicly available information regarding our lenders, we currently do not expect to lose borrowing capacity under our existing lines of credit and term loans as a result of a consolidation, merger or other business combination among our lenders. However, our access to funds under our credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the lenders that are parties to such facilities to meet their funding commitments to us. We continue to closely monitor global economic conditions and the lenders who are parties to our credit facilities, as well as our long-term debt and credit ratings and outlooks, our customers’ financial positions, private capital raising and capital market activity. Should we face a situation in which we do not have sufficient cash available to us through our operations to continue operating our business as usual, we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity. Such alternatives may include, without limitation, divesting ourselves of properties, whether or not the sales price is optimal or if they otherwise meet our strategic objectives to keep for the long term; issuing and selling our debt and equity in public or private transactions whether or not at favorable pricing or on favorable terms; entering into leases with our customers at lower rental rates or entering into lease renewals with our existing customers without an increase in rental rates at turnover or, in either case, on suboptimal terms. Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2008, cash provided by operating activities was $301.0 million as compared to $240.5 million for the same period in 2007. This change was primarily due to an increase in impairment losses, a decrease in income from operations, development profits and gains from sales and contributions of real estate interests, net, and changes in our accounts receivable and other assets and accounts payable and other liabilities. Cash used in investing activities was $888.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to cash used in investing activities of $632.2 million for the same period in 2007. This increase was primarily due to an increase in cash paid for property acquisitions, a decrease in net proceeds from divestiture of real estate and securities, an increase in loans made to affiliates and the purchase of additional equity interest in G. Accion, offset by an increase in repayment of mortgage and loan receivables and a decrease in additions to land, buildings, development costs, building improvements and lease costs. Cash provided by financing activities was $581.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to cash provided by financing activities of $420.0 million for the same period in 2007. This increase was due primarily to an increase in borrowings on other debt, net of payments, an increase in proceeds from issuances of senior debt, net of payments, an increase in borrowings on unsecured credit facilities, net of payments, a decrease in the repurchase of preferred units and a decrease in distributions to minority interests. This activity was partially offset by a decrease in the issuance of common stock. Subject to the above discussion, we believe our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, and borrowings available under our unsecured credit facilities, are adequate for us to meet our current liquidity requirements. However, there can be no assurance that our sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet our needs. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial 63 Table of Contents condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders, and the market price of our stock.

As of December 31, 2008, we held for divestiture two properties with an aggregate net book value of $8.2 million. These properties either are not in our core markets, do not meet our current investment objectives, or are included as part of our development-for-sale or value-added conversion programs.

Third-party equity interests in the consolidated co-investment ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2008, we owned approximately 78.7 million square feet of our properties (49.2% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated and unconsolidated co-investment ventures.

On June 30, 2007, we exercised our option to purchase the remaining equity interest held by an unrelated third party, based on the fair market value as stipulated in the joint venture agreement, in AMB Pier One, LLC, for a nominal amount. As a result, the investment was consolidated as of June 30, 2007. As of December 31, 2008, we also had a 100% consolidated interest in G.

Common and Preferred Equity. We have authorized for issuance 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which the following series were designated as of December 31, 2008: 1,595,337 shares of series D cumulative redeemable preferred, none of which are outstanding; 2,300,000 shares of series L cumulative redeemable preferred, of which 2,000,000 are outstanding; 2,300,000 shares of series M cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding; 3,000,000 shares of series O cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding; and 2,000,000 shares of series P cumulative redeemable preferred, all of which are outstanding.

We have the authorization to repurchase up to an additional $112.3 million of our common stock under the 2007 program. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend over the long-term to operate with an our share of total debt-to-our share of total market capitalization ratio or our share of total debt-to-our share of total assets of approximately 45% or less. In order to operate at this targeted ratio over the long term, we are currently exploring various options to monetize our development assets through possible contribution to funds where capacity is available, the formation of joint ventures and the sale to third parties. We are also exploring the potential sale of operating assets to further enhance liquidity. As of December 31, 2008, our share of total debt-to-our share of total market capitalization ratio was 61.4%. (See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratios table below for our definitions of “our share of total market capitalization,” “market equity,” “our share of total debt” and “our share of total assets”). We typically finance our co-investment ventures with secured debt at a loan-to-value ratio of 50-65% per our co-investment venture agreements. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. For example, decreases in the market price of our common stock have caused an increase in the ratio of our share of total debt-to-our share of total market capitalization. As of December 31, 2008, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.5 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $1.2 million. Of the $1.5 billion of secured debt, $808.1 million is secured by properties in our joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non-recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 1.0% to 10.7% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 4.3%) and final maturity dates ranging from March 2009 to November 2022. As of December 31, 2008, $936.9 million of the secured debt obligations bear interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 5.8%, while the remaining $586.8 million bear interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 2.6%). On February 14, 2007, seven subsidiaries of AMB-SGP, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, which is one of our subsidiaries, entered into a loan agreement for a $305.0 million secured financing. On the same day, pursuant to the loan agreement, the same seven subsidiaries delivered four promissory notes to the two lenders, each of which matures on March 5, 2012. One note had a principal of $160.0 million and an interest rate that is fixed at 5.29%. The second note had an initial principal borrowing of $40.0 million with a variable interest rate of 81.0 basis points 69 Table of Contents above the one-month LIBOR rate. The third note has an initial principal borrowing of $84.0 million and a fixed interest rate of 5.90%. The fourth note had an initial principal borrowing of $21.0 million and bears interest at a variable rate of 135.0 basis points above the one-month LIBOR rate. On September 4, 2008, the operating partnership entered into a $230.0 million secured term loan credit agreement that matures on September 4, 2010 and had a weighted average interest rate of 4.0% at December 31, 2008. We are the guarantor of the operating partnership’s obligations under the term loan facility. The term loan facility carries a one-year extension option, which the operating partnership may exercise at its sole option so long as the operating partnership’s long-term debt rating is investment grade, among other things, and can be increased up to $300.0 million upon certain conditions. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, which was 130.0 basis points as of December 31, 2008, based on the operating partnership’s long-term debt rating. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the base rate on the term loan was fixed at 2.7% through December 11, 2009 through interest rate swaps. If the operating partnership’s long-term debt ratings fall below current levels, our cost of debt will increase. As of December 31, 2008, the operating partnership had outstanding an aggregate of $1.2 billion in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.0% and had an average term of 4.1 years. In May 2008, we sold $325.0 million aggregate principal amount of the operating partnership’s senior unsecured notes under its Series C medium-term note program. We guarantee the operating partnership’s obligations with respect to its unsecured senior debt securities. The unsecured senior debt securities are subject to various covenants. The covenants contain affirmative covenants, including compliance with financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. In March 2008, the operating partnership obtained a $325.0 million unsecured term loan facility, which had a balance of $325.0 million outstanding as of December 31, 2008, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.5%. In February 2008, the operating partnership also obtained a $100.0 million unsecured money market loan with a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% and subsequently paid off the entire balance in June 2008. In June 2008, the operating partnership obtained a new $100.0 million unsecured loan with a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and subsequently paid off the entire balance in September 2008. We guarantee the operating partnership’s obligations with respect to its unsecured debt. The unsecured debt is subject to various covenants. The covenants contain affirmative covenants, including compliance with financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders, and the market price of our stock. As of December 31, 2008, we had $392.8 million outstanding in other debt which bore a weighted average interest rate of 3.9% and had an average term of 1.2 years. Other debt also includes a $70.0 million credit facility obtained on August 24, 2007 by AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, which had a $50.0 million balance outstanding as of December 31, 2008. We also had $342.8 million outstanding in other debt. We may from time to time, seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. Credit Facilities. The operating partnership has a $550.0 million (includes Euros, Yen, British pounds sterling or U.S. dollar denominated borrowings) unsecured revolving credit facility, which bore a weighted average 70 Table of Contents interest rate of 2.85% at December 31, 2008. This facility matures on June 1, 2010. We are a guarantor of the operating partnership’s obligations under the credit facility. The line carries a one-year extension option, which the operating partnership may exercise at its sole option so long as the operating partnership’s long-term debt rating is investment grade, among other things, and the facility can be increased to up to $700.0 million upon certain conditions. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, which was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2008, based on the operating partnership’s long-term debt rating, with an annual facility fee of 15.0 basis points. If the operating partnership’s long-term debt ratings fall below current levels, our cost of debt will increase. If the operating partnership’s long-term debt ratings fall below investment grade, the operating partnership will be unable to request money market loans and borrowings in Euros, Yen or British pounds sterling. The four-year credit facility includes a multi-currency component, under which up to $550.0 million can be drawn in Euros, Yen, British pounds sterling or U.S. dollars. The operating partnership uses the credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2008, was $243.1 million and the remaining amount available was $281.4 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $25.5 million. The credit agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios by the operating partnership, and negative covenants, including limitations on mergers or consolidations. AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, has a Yen-denominated unsecured revolving credit facility with an initial borrowing limit of 55.0 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2008, equaled approximately $606.5 million U.S. dollars and bore a weighted average interest rate of 1.3%. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan, China and South Korea. Generally, borrowers under the credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. The credit facility matures in June 2010 and has a one-year extension option, which the operating partnership may exercise at its sole option so long as the operating partnership’s long-term debt rating is investment grade, among other things. The extension option is also subject to the satisfaction of certain other conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which was 42.5 basis points as of December 31, 2008, based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s long-term debt. If the operating partnership’s long-term debt ratings fall below current levels, our cost of debt will increase. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s long-term debt, and was 15.0 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility as of December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2008, was $342.2 million, and the remaining amount available was $264.4 million. The credit agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. On July 16, 2007, certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and the operating partnership, each acting as a borrower, with us and the operating partnership as guarantors, entered into a fifth amended and restated revolving credit agreement for a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that replaced the existing $250.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The fifth amended and restated credit facility amends the fourth amended and restated credit facility to, among other things, increase the facility amount to $500.0 million with an option to further increase the facility to $750.0 million, to extend the maturity date to July 2011 and to allow for future borrowing in Indian rupees. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations for such subsidiaries and other entities controlled by the operating partnership that are selected by the operating partnership from time to time to be borrowers under and pursuant to our credit facility. Generally, borrowers under the credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the credit facility. The credit facility includes a multi-currency component under which up to $500.0 million can be drawn in U.S. dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Singapore dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds sterling, and Euros with the ability to add Indian rupees. 71 Table of Contents The line, which matures in July 2011, carries a one-year extension option, which the operating partnership may exercise at its sole option so long as the operating partnership’s long-term debt rating is investment grade, among other things, and can be increased to up to $750.0 million upon certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.15% of the outstanding commitments. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, which was 60.0 basis points as of December 31, 2008, based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt, with an annual facility fee based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s senior unsecured long-term debt. If the operating partnership’s long-term debt ratings fall below current levels, our cost of debt will increase. If the operating partnership’s long-term debt ratings fall below investment grade, the operating partnership will be unable to request borrowings in any currency other than U.S. dollars. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and general working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2008, the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rates in effect at December 31, 2008, was approximately $335.6 million with a weighted average interest rate of 2.74%, and the remaining amount available was $164.4 million. The credit agreement contains affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios by the operating partnership, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. On June 12, 2007, AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS assumed a 328.0 million Euro facility agreement, and we were released from all of our obligations and liabilities related to this facility agreement. On June 12, 2007, there were 267.0 million Euros (approximately $355.2 million in U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at June 12, 2007) of term loans and no acquisition loans outstanding under the facility agreement.

(2) The weighted average interest and average maturity for the unconsolidated joint venture debt were 4.8% and 4.9 years, respectively. 72 Table of Contents (3) Our share of total debt represents the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated or unconsolidated joint ventures holding the debt. We believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the co-investment ventures. The above table reconciles our share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure.

Our definition of “preferred” is preferred equity liquidation preferences. “Our share of total book capitalization” is defined as our share of total debt plus minority interests to preferred unitholders and limited partnership unitholders plus stockholders’ equity. “Our share of total debt” is the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures holding the debt. “Our share of total assets” is the pro rata portion of the gross book value of real estate interests plus cash and other assets. We believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures.

For a reconciliation of our share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure, please see the table of debt maturities and capitalization above. Liquidity As of December 31, 2008, we had $223.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $710.2 million of additional available borrowings under our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2008, we had $27.3 million in restricted cash. Our available cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts. The invested cash is invested in money market funds that invest solely in direct obligations of the government of the United States or in time deposits with certain financial institutions. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. At any point in time, we also have a significant amount of cash deposits in our operating accounts that are with third party financial institutions, which was, as of December 31, 2008, approximately $176.6 million on a consolidated basis. These balances exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. While we monitor daily the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate, these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts. 74 Table of Contents The following table sets forth the dividends and distributions paid or payable per share or unit for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006: Paying Entity Security 2008 2007 2006 AMB Property Corporation Common stock $ 1.56 $ 2.00 $ 1.84 AMB Property Corporation Series L preferred stock $ 1.63 $ 1.63 $ 1.63 AMB Property Corporation Series M preferred stock $ 1.69 $ 1.69 $ 1.69 AMB Property Corporation Series O preferred stock $ 1.75 $ 1.75 $ 1.75 AMB Property Corporation Series P preferred stock $ 1.71 $ 1.71 $ 0.60 Operating Partnership Common limited partnership units $ 1.56 $ 2.00 $ 1.84 Operating Partnership Series J preferred units(1) n/a $ 1.01 $ 3.98 Operating Partnership Series K preferred units(1) n/a $ 1.01 $ 3.98 AMB Property II, L.P.

(5) In April 2007, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of its outstanding series I preferred units. (6) The holder of the series N preferred units exercised its put option in January 2006 and sold all of its series N preferred units to the operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased all of such units from the operating partnership. The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to pay all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders, and the market price of our stock. We are currently exploring various options to monetize our development assets including contribution to funds where investment capacity is available, the formation of joint ventures and the sale of assets to third parties. We are also exploring the potential sale of operating assets to further enhance liquidity. There can be no assurance, however, that we will choose to or be able to monetize any of our assets. Cash flows generated by our business were sufficient to cover our dividends and distributions for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Cash flows from our real estate operations and private capital businesses, which are included in “Net cash provided by operating activities” in our Cash Flows from Operating Activities and cash flows from our real estate development and operations businesses which are included in “Net proceeds from divestiture of real estate” in our Cash Flows from Investing Activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, were sufficient to pay dividends on our common stock, distributions on our preferred stock and common and preferred limited partnership units of AMB Property, L.P. and AMB Property II, L.P. and distributions to minority interests for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Cash Flows from Operating Activities alone were not sufficient to pay such dividends and distributions for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, as shown in the table below. We use proceeds from our businesses included in Cash Flows from Investing Activities 75 Table of Contents (specifically, the proceeds from sales and contributions of properties as part of our real estate development and operations businesses) to fund dividends and distributions not covered by Cash Flows from Operating Activities. For the Years Ended December 31, Summary of Distributions Paid 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 301,020 $ 240,543 $ 335,855 Dividends paid to common and preferred stockholders (220,476 ) (211,744 ) (174,266 ) Distributions to minority interests, including preferred units (66,007 ) (137,722 ) (169,726 ) Excess (shortfall) of net cash provided by operating activities over dividends and distributions paid $ 14,537 $ (108,923 ) $ (8,137 ) Net proceeds from divestiture of real estate $ 421,647 $ 824,628 $ 616,343 Excess of net cash provided by operating activities and net proceeds from divestiture of real estate over dividends and distributions paid $ 436,184 $ 715,705 $ 608,206 Capital Commitments Development starts, generally defined as projects where we have obtained building permits and have begun physical construction, during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 The Americas: Number of new development projects 15 26 Number of value-added conversion projects(1) — 1 Square feet 4,464,298 7,427,914 Estimated total investment(2) $ 316,995 $ 559,276 Europe: Number of new development projects 4 6 Square feet 885,611 1,687,601 Estimated total investment(2) $ 103,823 $ 220,200 Asia: Number of new development projects 4 6 Square feet 2,038,437 3,060,335 Estimated total investment(2) $ 123,910 $ 305,872 Total: Number of new development projects 23 38 Number of value-added conversion projects — 1 Square feet 7,388,346 12,175,850 Estimated total investment(2) $ 544,728 $ 1,085,348 Total development pipeline estimated investment(2)(3) $ 1,319,017 $ 1,712,908 Total development pipeline funded-to-date(4) $ 1,057,207 $ 1,214,257 Total development pipeline remaining-to-fund(4)(5) $ 261,810 $ 498,651 (1) Value-added conversion projects represent the repurposing of industrial properties to a higher and better use, including office, residential, retail, research and development or manufacturing. Activities required to prepare the property for conversion to a higher and better use may include such activities as rezoning, redesigning, reconstructing and retenanting. The sales price of the value-added conversion project is generally based on the 76 Table of Contents underlying land value based on its ultimate use and as such, little to no residual value is ascribed to the industrial building(s). (2) Includes total estimated cost of development, renovation, or expansion, including initial acquisition costs, prepaid ground leases, buildings, tenant improvements and associated capitalized interest and overhead costs. Estimated total investments are based on current forecasts and are subject to change. Non-U.S. dollar investments are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rate as of December 31, 2008 or 2007, as applicable. (3) Excludes the impact of real estate impairment losses and includes value-added conversions. (4) Amounts include capitalized interest and overhead costs, as applicable. (5) Calculated using estimated total investment before the impact of real estate impairment losses. Development Pipeline. As of December 31, 2008, we had 53 projects in the development pipeline, on an owned and managed basis, which are expected to total approximately 16.4 million square feet and have an aggregate estimated investment of $1.3 billion upon completion. Four of these projects totaling approximately 1.4 million square feet with an aggregate estimated investment of $80.0 million are held in an unconsolidated co-investment venture. We had an additional eight development projects held for divestiture or contribution totaling approximately 1.5 million square feet, with an aggregate estimated investment of $264.3 million, net of $3.3 million of real estate impairment losses, and an aggregate net book value of $258.4 million. As of December 31, 2008, on an owned and managed basis, we and our development joint venture partners have funded an aggregate of $1.1 billion, or 80%, of the total estimated investment and will need to fund an estimated additional $261.8 million, or 20%, in order to complete our development pipeline. The development pipeline, at December 31, 2008, included projects expected to be completed through the fourth quarter of 2010. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 2,503 acres of land for future development or sale, on an owned and managed basis, approximately 86% of which is located in North America, including 79 acres that are held in an unconsolidated joint venture. We currently estimate that these 2,503 acres of land could support approximately 45.1 million square feet of future development. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on-tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from 1 to 54 years. These buildings and improvements subject to ground leases are amortized ratably over the lesser of the terms of the related leases or 40 years. Future minimum rental payments required under non-cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2008 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2009 $ 30,127 2010 28,693 2011 27,834 2012 27,180 2013 26,024 Thereafter 412,803 Total $ 552,661 Co-Investment Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co-investment ventures with institutional investors. These co-investment ventures are managed by AMB Capital Partners, LLC and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2008, we had investments in three co-investment ventures with a gross book value of $1.2 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and net equity investments in five unconsolidated co-investment ventures of $356.9 million with a gross book value of $6.4 billion. As of December 31, 2008, we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co-investment ventures of up to $120.1 million (using the exchange rates at December 31, 2008) pursuant to the terms of the co-investment venture agreements. From time to time, we may raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open-ended unconsolidated co-investment venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, most of whom invest through a private real estate investment trust, and for AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, an open-ended unconsolidated co-investment venture formed in 2007 with institutional investors. This would increase our obligation to make additional capital commitments to these ventures. Pursuant to the terms of the 77 Table of Contents partnership agreement of AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., and the management regulations of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, we are obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments until such time when our total equity commitment is greater than $150.0 million or 150.0 million Euros, respectively, at which time, our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely affect our cash flow; however, there can be no assurance that these sources of capital will be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet our requirements. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, we formed a wholly owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd. (Arcata), which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the attachment point of our third-party insurance policies. The captive insurance company is one element of our overall risk management program. We capitalized Arcata in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata establishes annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Like premiums paid to third-party insurance companies, premiums paid to Arcata may be reimbursed by customers pursuant to specific lease terms. Through this structure, we think that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Contingent and Unknown Liabilities. Contingent and unknown liabilities may include the following: • liabilities for environmental conditions; • losses in excess of insured coverage; • claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation or acquisition transactions that had not been asserted or were unknown prior to our formation or acquisition transactions; • claims for indemnification by the general partners, officers and directors and others indemnified by the former owners of our properties; • accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and • tax, legal and regulatory liabilities. 78 Table of Contents Capital Deployment Land acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 The Americas: Acres 197 1,231 Estimated build out potential (square feet) 3,537,632 21,083,750 Investment(1) $ 88,436 $ 221,645 Europe: Acres 72 182 Estimated build out potential (square feet) 1,613,087 3,328,267 Investment(1) $ 66,850 $ 38,544 Asia: Acres 111 28 Estimated build out potential (square feet) 4,371,377 997,537 Investment(1) $ 61,776 $ 20,977 Total: Acres 380 1,441 Estimated build out potential (square feet) 9,522,096 25,409,554 Investment(1) $ 217,062 $ 281,166 (1) Represents actual cost incurred to date including initial acquisition, associated closing costs, infrastructure and associated capitalized interest and overhead costs. 79 Table of Contents Acquisition activity during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was as follows (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Number of properties acquired by AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. 8 28 Square feet 1,622,649 6,213,093 Expected investment $ 171,694 $ 527,264 Number of properties acquired by AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS 3 7 Square feet 848,313 2,101,393 Expected investment $ 154,499 $ 201,794 Number of properties acquired by AMB Japan Fund I, L.P. — 8 Square feet — 1,107,261 Expected investment $ — $ 180,901 Number of properties acquired by AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC — 3 Square feet — 1,739,976 Expected investment $ — $ 69,688 Number of properties acquired by AMB Property, L.P. 10 7 Square feet 2,830,936 701,629 Expected investment $ 217,044 $ 62,241 Total number of properties acquired 21 53 Total square feet 5,301,898 11,863,352 Total acquisition cost $ 529,574 $ 1,022,547 Total acquisition capital 13,663 19,341 Total expected investment(1) $ 543,237 $ 1,041,888 (1) Includes total estimated cost of development, renovation, or expansion, including initial acquisition costs, prepaid ground leases, buildings, tenant improvements and associated capitalized interest and overhead costs.

Overview of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our debt, interest and lease payments due by period as of December 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands): Less than More than Contractual Obligations 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years Total Debt $ 798,037 $ 1,863,531 $ 1,004,961 $ 333,409 $ 3,999,938 Debt interest payments 25,215 71,534 57,182 21,173 175,104 Operating lease commitments 30,127 56,527 53,204 412,803 552,661 Construction commitments 200,811 — — — 200,811 Total $ 1,054,190 $ 1,991,592 $ 1,115,347 $ 767,385 $ 4,928,514 80 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Standby Letters of Credit. As of December 31, 2008, we had provided approximately $32.7 million in letters of credit, of which $25.5 million were provided under the operating partnership’s $550.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees and Contribution Obligations. Excluding parent guarantees associated with debt or contribution obligations as discussed in Notes 6 and 10, we had outstanding guarantees and contribution obligations in the aggregate amount of $639.9 million as described below. As of December 31, 2008, we had outstanding bank guarantees in the amount of $27.8 million used to secure contingent obligations, primarily obligations under development and purchase agreements, including $0.7 million guaranteed under a purchase agreement entered into by an unconsolidated joint venture. As of December 31, 2008, we also guaranteed $49.6 million and $231.8 million on outstanding loans for six of our consolidated joint ventures and four of our unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively. Also, we have entered into contribution agreements with certain of our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. These contribution agreements require us to make additional capital contributions to the applicable co-investment venture fund upon certain defaults by the co-investment venture of certain of its debt obligations to the lenders. Such additional capital contributions will cover all or part of the applicable co-investment venture’s debt obligation and may be greater than our share of the co-investment venture’s debt obligation or the value of our share of any property securing such debt. Our contribution obligations under these agreements will be reduced by the amounts recovered by the lender and the fair market value of the property, if any, used to secure the debt and obtained by the lender upon default. Our potential obligations under these contribution agreements total $260.6 million as of December 31, 2008. On May 30, 2008, the operating partnership entered into a 142.0 million Euro 364-day multi-currency revolving facility agreement (approximately $198.4 million in U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at December 31, 2008) and related guarantee as loan guarantor with our affiliate AMB Fund Management S.à.r.l. on behalf of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, certain of our European affiliates, ING Real Estate Finance N.V. and certain of its European affiliates and ING Real Estate Finance N.V. The facility agreement provided that certain of the affiliates of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS may borrow unsecured loans in an aggregate amount of up to 142.0 million Euros (approximately $198.4 million in U.S. dollars, using the exchange rate at December 31, 2008) all of which were repayable 364 days after the date of the facility agreement (unless otherwise agreed). All amounts owed under the facility agreement were guaranteed by the operating partnership. AMB Fund Management S.á.r.l. on behalf of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS indemnified the operating partnership for all of its obligations under the guarantee. On December 29, 2008, the operating partnership terminated the facility agreement and related guarantee. Prior to the termination of the facility agreement, four of our European affiliates that were subsidiaries of AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS holding real property interests in Germany were borrowers under such facility agreement. The outstanding borrowed amount of our European affiliate borrowers under such facility agreement was repaid in full on December 29, 2008. In connection with the payment in full under, and the termination of, this facility agreement, our European affiliate borrowers and/or their affiliates borrowed funds under an existing credit facility held by AMB Europe Fund I, FCP-FIS, and entered new 5-year term loans with the lender in the aggregate amount of 50.2 million Euros (approximately $70.1 million in U.S. dollars using the exchange rate as of December 31, 2008) under such facility. The borrowed funds were used to repay the outstanding amounts under the terminated 142.0 million Euro credit facility. The European affiliate borrowers are in the process of granting security interests to the lender, as the security agent, under and in accordance with the terms of such facility, all of which security interests are expected to become effective in the first half of 2009. The operating partnership has agreed to guarantee the 50.2 million Euros amount borrowed under such existing credit facility only until the security interests are granted, at which time the guarantees will be extinguished. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2008, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $17.8 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of our development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real 81 Table of Contents property improvements and infrastructure. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promote Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain of our joint venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us. From time to time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments, pay promotes or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. Supplemental Earnings Measures Funds From Operations (“FFO”) and Funds From Operations Per Share and Unit (“FFOPS”). We believe that net income (loss), as defined by U.S. GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, and FFO per share and unit, or FFOPS, to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. We define FFOPS as FFO per fully diluted weighted average share of our common stock and operating partnership units. We calculate FFO as net income (loss), calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate-related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. We include the gains from development, including those from value-added conversion projects, before depreciation recapture, as a component of FFO. We believe that value-added conversion dispositions are in substance land sales and as such should be included in FFO, consistent with the real estate investment trust industry’s long standing practice to include gains on the sale of land in FFO. However, our interpretation of FFO or FFOPS may not be consistent with the views of others in the real estate investment trust industry, who may consider it to be a divergence from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) definition, and may not be comparable to FFO or FFOPS reported by other real estate investment trusts that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. In connection with the formation of a joint venture, we may warehouse assets that are acquired with the intent to contribute these assets to the newly formed venture. Some of the properties held for contribution may, under certain circumstances, be required to be depreciated under U.S. GAAP. If this circumstance arises, we intend to include in our calculation of FFO gains or losses related to the contribution of previously depreciated real estate to joint ventures. Although such a change, if instituted, will be a departure from the current NAREIT definition, we believe such calculation of FFO will better reflect the value created as a result of the contributions. To date, we have not included gains or losses from the contribution of previously depreciated warehoused assets in FFO. We believe that FFO and FFOPS are meaningful supplemental measures of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, FFO and FFOPS are supplemental measures of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that exclude historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income (loss), as defined by U.S. GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO and FFOPS, combined with the required U.S. GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO and FFOPS to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO and FFOPS can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO and FFOPS are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, FFO and FFOPS do not represent cash flow from operations or net income (loss) as defined by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO and FFOPS also do not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets 82 Table of Contents nor are FFO and FFOPS necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Management compensates for the limitations of FFO and FFOPS by providing investors with financial statements prepared according to U.S. GAAP, along with this detailed discussion of FFO and FFOPS and a reconciliation of FFO and FFOPS to net income, a U.S. GAAP measurement. The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled from net income (loss) for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts): 2008 2007 2006 Net (loss) income available to common stockholders(1) $ (65,116 ) $ 295,524 $ 209,420 (Gains) losses from sale or contribution of real estate, net of minority interests(2) (21,854 ) (85,544 ) (42,635 ) Depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 169,145 162,311 175,432 Discontinued operations’ depreciation 54 1,415 4,545 Non-real estate depreciation (7,270 ) (5,623 ) (4,546 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from consolidated co-investment ventures: Co-investment venture partners’ minority interests (Net income) 32,310 27,691 37,571 Limited partnership unitholders’ minority interests (Net income) (5,442 ) 5,158 2,528 Limited partnership unitholders’ minority interests (Development gains) 2,822 7,148 4,948 Discontinued operations’ minority interests (Net income) 217 390 712 FFO attributable to minority interests (49,957 ) (62,902 ) (82,861 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures: Our share of net income (17,121 ) (7,467 ) (23,240 ) Our share of FFO 42,742 27,391 16,038 Our share of development gains, net of taxes — — — Funds from operations $ 80,530 $ 365,492 $ 297,912 Basic FFO per common share and unit $ 0.83 $ 3.60 $ 3.24 Diluted FFO per common share and unit $ 0.78 $ 3.51 $ 3.12 Weighted average common shares and units: Basic 97,403,659 101,550,001 92,047,678 Diluted 102,855,848 104,168,707 95,444,072 (1) Includes gains from undepreciated land sales of $1.8 million, $9.2 million and $5.6 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. (2) The information for 2007 includes accumulated depreciation re-capture of approximately $10.1 million associated with the sale of two value-added conversion projects. SS NOI We believe that net income (loss), as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider same store net operating income, or SS NOI, and cash-basis SS NOI to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. Properties that are considered part of the same store pool include all properties that were owned, or owned and managed, as the case may be, as of the end of both the current and prior year reporting periods and exclude development properties for both the current and prior reporting periods. The same store pool is set annually and excludes properties purchased and developments stabilized after December 31, 2006 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties that have been substantially complete for at least 12 months). In deriving SS NOI, we define net operating income as rental revenues, including reimbursements, less property operating expenses, both of which are calculated in accordance with GAAP. Property operating expenses exclude depreciation, amortization, general and administrative expenses and interest expense. In calculating cash-basis SS NOI, we exclude straight-line rents and amortization of lease intangibles from the calculation of SS NOI. We consider cash-basis SS NOI to be an appropriate and useful supplemental performance measure because it reflects the operating performance of our real estate portfolio excluding effects of non-cash adjustments and provides a better measure of actual cash-basis rental growth for a year-over-year comparison. In addition, we believe that SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI help the investing public compare our operating performance with that of other 83 Table of Contents companies. While SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, they do not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI also do not reflect general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization costs, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating these measures. The following table reconciles SS NOI and cash-basis SS NOI from net income (loss) for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2008 2007 2006 Net (loss) income $ (49,310 ) $ 314,260 $ 224,072 Private capital revenues (68,470 ) (31,707 ) (46,102 ) Depreciation and amortization 169,145 162,311 175,432 General and administrative 143,982 129,510 104,262 Fund costs 1,078 1,076 2,091 Restructuring charges 12,306 — — Real estate impairment losses 193,918 1,157 6,312 Other expenses 520 5,112 2,620 Total other income and expenses 18,556 (100,475 ) 20,009 Total minority interests’ share of income 41,636 54,825 62,174 Total discontinued operations (1,486 ) (70,892 ) (57,596 ) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle — — (193 ) Net Operating Income (NOI) 461,875 465,177 493,081 Less non same store NOI (95,486 ) (106,524 ) (18,669 ) Less non-cash adjustments(1) 456 (4,019 ) (11,858 ) Cash basis same store NOI $ 366,845 $ 354,634 $ 462,554 (1) Non-cash adjustments include straight-line rents and amortization of lease intangibles for the same store pool only. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimize the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2008, we had three outstanding interest rate swaps, two interest rate caps, and two outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $876.8 million (in U.S. dollars). See “Financial Instruments” below. 84 Table of Contents The table below summarizes the maturities and interest rates associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding at book value and estimated fair value before net unamortized debt discounts of $9.7 million as of December 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands): 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Fair Value Fixed rate debt(1) $ 478,175 $ 636,486 $ 142,008 $ 379,261 $ 540,525 $ 304,066 $ 2,480,521 $ 2,104,418 Average interest rate 3.9 % 5.6 % 6.6 % 5.9 % 6.1 % 6.4 % 5.6 % n/a Variable rate debt(2) $ 319,862 $ 627,541 $ 457,496 $ 62,896 $ 22,279 $ 29,343 $ 1,519,417 $ 1,427,698 Average interest rate 2.1 % 2.5 % 2.4 % 1.5 % 2.9 % 6.3 % 2.4 % n/a Interest payments $ 25,215 $ 51,365 $ 20,169 $ 23,366 $ 33,817 $ 21,173 $ 175,105 n/a (1) Represents 62.0% of all outstanding debt at December 31, 2008. (2) Represents 38.0% of all outstanding debt at December 31, 2008. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased or decreased by 10%, then the increase or decrease in interest cost on our variable rate debt would be $3.6 million (net of the swap) annually. As of December 31, 2008, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $4.0 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, based on our estimate of current market interest rates. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, variable rate debt comprised 38.0% and 39.0%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non-functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2008 were three interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of variable rate borrowings based on U.S. Libor (USD), two interest rate caps hedging cash flows of variable rate borrowings based on Japanese Yen Libor, and two currency forward contracts hedging intercompany loans. 85 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our financial instruments as of December 31, 2008 (in thousands): Maturity Dates March 31, September 27, December 11, September 4, November 21, Notional Fair Related Derivatives (dollars in thousands) 2009 2009 2009 2010 2011 Amount Value Interest Rate Swaps (USD) Notional Amount $ 325,000 $ 325,000 Receive Floating(%) US LIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 2.50 % Fair Market Value (USD) $ (4,266 ) $ (4,266 ) Notional Amount $ 130,000 $ 130,000 Receive Floating(%) US LIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 2.70 % Fair Market Value (USD) $ (2,609 ) $ (2,609 ) Notional Amount $ 100,000 $ 100,000 Receive Floating(%) US LIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 2.70 % Fair Market Value (USD) $ (1,208 ) $ (1,208 ) Interest Rate Caps (JPY) Notional Amount $ 86,017 $ 86,017 Receive Floating(%) JPY-LIBOR-BBA Pay Fixed Rate(%) 1.50 % Fair Market Value (USD) $ 51 $ 51 Notional Amount $ 11,028 $ 11,028 Receive Floating(%) JPY-LIBOR-BBA Pay Fixed Rate(%) 1.50 % Fair Market Value (USD) $ 7 $ 7 Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts FX Forward Contract, Euro Notional Amount (USD) $ 161,980 $ 161,980 Forward Strike Rate 1.41 3/31/09 Forward Rate as of 12/31/2008 1.39 Fair Market Value (USD) $ 1,508 $ 1,508 FX Forward Contract, GBP Notional Amount (USD) $ 62,736 $ 62,736 Forward Strike Rate 1.44 3/31/09 Forward Rate as of 12/31/2008 1.46 Fair Market Value (USD) $ (720 ) $ (720 ) $ 876,761 $ (7,237 ) International Operations. Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States, Mexico and certain subsidiaries in Europe. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside the United States, other than Mexico and certain subsidiaries in Europe, is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity or property is located, mitigating the effect of foreign exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. The gains resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders’ equity and totaled $23.6 million and $14.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non-monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income 86 Table of Contents statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, total unrealized and realized (losses) gains from remeasurement included in our results of operations were $(5.7) million, $3.9 million and $0.8 million, respectively.",2023-12-30 18:37:08.556835

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Business Risks” for a complete discussion of the various risks that could adversely affect us. Item 2. Properties We operate industrial and retail properties nationwide and manage our business both by property type and by market. Industrial properties consist primarily of warehouse distribution facilities suitable for single or multiple customers and are typically comprised of multiple buildings that are leased to customers engaged in various types of businesses. As of December 31, 2001, we operated industrial properties in eight hub and gateway markets in addition to 18 other markets nationwide. As of December 31, 2001, we operated retail properties in Miami, Atlanta, Chicago, the San Francisco Bay Area, Boston, and Baltimore. Retail properties are generally leased to one or more anchor customers, such as grocery and drug stores, and various retail businesses. See “Item 14. Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for segment information related to our operations. INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES As of December 31, 2001, we owned 905 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 81.6 million rentable square feet, located in 26 markets nationwide. Our industrial properties accounted for $494.9 million, or 96.8%, of our total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2001. Our industrial properties were 94.5% leased to over 2,900 customers, the largest of which accounted for no more than 1.3% of our annualized base rent from our industrial properties. Property Characteristics. Our industrial properties, which consist primarily of warehouse distribution facilities suitable for single or multiple customers, are typically comprised of multiple buildings. The following table identifies type and characteristics of our industrial buildings: Building Type Description % of Portfolio Warehouse 15,000-75,000 SF, single or multi-customer 40.3% Bulk Warehouse Over 75,000 SF, single or multi-customer 37.8% Flex Industrial May include assembly or R&D, single or multi-customer, higher parking ratios 9.6% Light Industrial Smaller customers, 15,000 SF or less, higher office finish 7.3% Trans-Shipment Unique configurations for truck terminals and specialized cross-docking 1.8% Air Cargo On-tarmac or airport land for transfer of air cargo goods 1.6% Office Single or multi-customer, used strictly for office 1.5% Lease Terms. Our industrial properties are typically subject to lease on a “triple net basis,” in which customers pay their proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, and operating costs, or are subject to leases on a “modified gross basis,” in which customers pay expenses over certain threshold levels. Lease terms typically range from three to ten years, with an average of six years, excluding renewal options. The majority of the industrial leases do not include renewal options. 5 Table of Contents Overview of Major Target Markets. Our industrial properties are located near key passenger and air cargo airports, key interstate highways, and sea ports in major metropolitan areas, such as Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas/ Fort Worth, Northern New Jersey, the San Francisco Bay Area, Southern California, Miami, and Seattle. We believe our industrial properties’ strategic location, transportation network and infrastructure, and large consumer and manufacturing bases support strong demand for industrial space. Within these metropolitan areas, our industrial properties are concentrated in locations with limited new construction opportunities within established, relatively large submarkets, which we believe should provide a higher rate of occupancy and rent growth than properties located elsewhere. These in-fill locations are typically near major passenger and air cargo facilities, seaports or convenient to major highways and rail lines, and are proximate to a diverse labor pool. There is typically broad demand for industrial space in these centrally located submarkets due to a diverse mix of industries and types of industrial uses, including warehouse distribution, light assembly and manufacturing.

Properties Held Through Joint Ventures, Limited Liability Companies, and Partnerships Consolidated: As of December 31, 2001, we held interests in joint ventures, limited liability companies, and partnerships with third parties, which are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements. Such investments are consolidated because: (1) we own a majority interest; or (2) we exercise significant control over major operating decisions such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, and changes in financing. Under the agreements governing the joint ventures, we and the other party to the joint venture may be required to make additional capital contributions, and subject to certain limitations, the joint ventures may incur additional debt. Such agreements also impose certain restrictions on the transfer of joint venture interests by us or the other party to the joint venture and provide certain rights to us or the other party to the joint venture to sell its interest to the joint venture or to the other joint venture partner on terms specified in the agreement.

Unconsolidated and Mortgage Investments: As of December 31, 2001, we held interests in three equity investment joint ventures that are unconsolidated in our financial statements. The management and control over significant aspects of these investments are with the third party joint venture partner. In addition, as of December 31, 2001, we held two mortgage investments from which we receive interest income.

Secured Debt As of December 31, 2001, we had $1.2 billion of indebtedness, net of unamortized premiums, secured by deeds of trust on 99 properties. As of December 31, 2001, the total gross investment value of those properties secured by debt was $2.3 billion. Of the $1.2 billion of secured indebtedness, $759.4 million was joint venture debt. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Item 14. Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in this report. We believe that as of December 31, 2001, the value of the properties securing the respective obligations in each case exceeded the principal amount of the outstanding obligations. Item 3. Legal Proceedings As of December 31, 2001, there were no pending legal proceedings to which we are a party or of which any of our properties are the subject, the adverse determination of which we anticipate would have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

Prior to November 26, 1997 (our initial public offering date), AMB Property Corporation’s predecessor provided real estate investment management services to institutional investors.

(2) The historical 1997 results represent our predecessor’s historical financial and other data for the period January 1, 1997 through November 25, 1997. The financial and other data of AMB Property Corporation and the properties acquired in our formation transactions have been included from November 26, 1997 to December 31, 1997. (3) Basic and diluted net income per share equals the net income available to common stockholders divided by 84,174,644 and 85,214,066 shares, respectively for 2001; 83,697,170 and 84,155,306 shares, respectively, for 2000; 86,271,862 and 86,347,487 shares, respectively, for 1999; 85,876,383 and 86,235,176 shares, respectively, for 1998; and pro forma net income divided by 85,874,513 and 86,156,556 shares, respectively, for 1997. (4) EBITDA is computed as income before divestiture of properties, net of minority interests and impairment charges, and minority interests plus interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. We believe that in addition to cash flows and net income, EBITDA is a useful financial performance measure for assessing the operating performance of a real estate investment trust because, together with net income and cash flows, EBITDA provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of a real estate investment trust to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures. Includes our pro rata share of EBITDA in an unconsolidated joint venture. EBITDA is not a measurement of operating performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered as a substitute for operating income, net income, cash flows from operations, or other statement of operations or cash flow data prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. EBITDA may not be indicative of our historical operating results nor our potential future results. While EBITDA is frequently used as a measure of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements, it is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other real estate investment trusts. (5) Operating earnings represents income before gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests and impairment reserves on properties held for divestiture and operating properties, less minority interests’ share of net income and preferred stock dividends. It excludes the preferred unit redemption premium. We believe that in addition to cash flows and net income, operating earnings is a useful financial performance measure for assessing the operating performance of a real estate investment trust because, together with 17 Table of Contents net income and cash flows, operating earnings provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of a real estate investment trust to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures. Operating earnings is not a measurement of operating performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should not be considered as a substitute for operating income, net income, cash flows from operations, or other statement of operations or cash flow data prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Operating earnings may not be indicative of our historical operating results nor our potential future results. While operating earnings is frequently used as a measure of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements, it is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other real estate investment trusts. (6) Funds from Operations, or FFO, is defined as income from operations before minority interest, gains or losses from sale of real estate, and extraordinary losses plus real estate depreciation and adjustment to derive our pro rata share of the FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures, less minority interests’ pro rata share of the FFO of consolidated joint ventures and preferred stock dividends. In accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust White Paper on funds from operations, we include the effects of straight-line rents in funds from operations. We believe that funds from operations is an appropriate measure of performance for a real estate investment trust. While funds from operations is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and it should not be considered as an alternative to these indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance. Further, funds from operations as disclosed by other real estate investment trusts may not be comparable. (7) Secured debt includes unamortized debt premiums of approximately $6.8 million, $9.9 million, $10.1 million, $15.2 million, and $18.3 million as of December 31, 2001, 2000, 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. See Notes 2 and 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements. Statements contained in this discussion that are not historical facts may be forward-looking statements. Such statements relate to our future performance and plans, results of operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and operating improvements and costs. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “approximately,” “intends,” “plans,” “pro forma,” “estimates,” or “anticipates‘ or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases. You can also identify forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties and you should not rely upon them as predictions of future events. There is no assurance that the events or circumstances reflected in forward-looking statements will occur or be achieved. Forward-looking statements are necessarily dependent on assumptions, data, or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to realize them. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements: • defaults or non-renewal of leases by customers; • increased interest rates and operating costs; • our failure to obtain necessary outside financing; • difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and in effecting acquisitions; • our failure to successfully integrate acquired properties and operations; • our failure to divest of properties that we have contracted to sell or to timely reinvest proceeds from any such divestitures; • risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including construction delays, cost overruns, our inability to obtain necessary permits, and public opposition to these activities); • our failure to qualify and maintain our status as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; • environmental uncertainties; • risks related to natural disasters; 18 Table of Contents • financial market fluctuations; • changes in real estate and zoning laws; • increases in real property tax rates; and • risks of doing business internationally. Our success also depends upon economic trends generally, including interest rates, income tax laws, governmental regulation, legislation, population changes, and those other risk factors discussed in the section entitled “Business Risks” in this report. We caution you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect our analysis only and speak as of the date of this report or as of the dates indicated in the statements. GENERAL We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company in connection with the completion of our initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with our initial tax return for the year ended December 31, 1997. AMB Property Corporation and the operating partnership were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering. We generate revenue primarily from rent received from customers at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs. In addition, our growth is, in part, dependent on our ability to increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties and our ability to continue the acquisition and development of additional properties. Our income would be adversely affected if a significant number of customers were unable to pay rent or if we were unable to rent our industrial space on favorable terms. Certain significant expenditures associated with an investment in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes, and maintenance costs) generally do not decline when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property. Moreover, as the general partner of the operating partnership, we generally will be liable for all of the operating partnership’s unsatisfied obligations other than non-recourse obligations, including the operating partnership’s obligations as the general partner of the co-investment joint ventures. Any such liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. REIT Compliance. We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. 19 Table of Contents Qualification as a real estate investment trust requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we must derive at least 95% of our gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. These provisions and the applicable treasury regulations are more complicated in our case because we hold our assets through the operating partnership. Legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. However, we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to operate as a real estate investment trust. If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification. If we lose our real estate investment trust status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. In addition, our annual fee on our unsecured credit facility may increase and certain rights that preferred limited partnership unitholders in our affiliates have to exchange their preferred units for shares of our preferred stock may be triggered. Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property-by-property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying amount of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future market conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying amount of our long-lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to income. We evaluated our properties held for divestiture and operating properties for impairment and reduced their carrying value by $18.6 million and $5.9 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. We believe that there are no additional impairments of the carrying values of our investments in real estate at December 31, 2001. Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. We have non-controlling limited partnership interests in three separate unconsolidated joint ventures. We account for the joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. We have a 56.1% interest in a joint venture, which owns an aggregate of 36 industrial buildings totaling approximately 4.0 million square feet. We also have a 50% interest in each of two other operating and development alliance joint ventures. Our net equity investment in these joint ventures is shown as Investment in unconsolidated joint ventures on our consolidated balance sheets. Investments in Other Companies. Investments in other companies were accounted for on a cost basis and realized gains and losses were included in current earnings. For our investments in private companies, we periodically reviewed our investments to determine if the value of such investments had been permanently impaired. During 2001, we recognized a loss on our investments in other companies totaling $20.8 million, including our investment in Webvan Group, Inc. We had previously recognized gains and losses on our investment in Webvan Group, Inc. as a component of other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2001, we had realized a loss on 100% of our investments in other companies. 20 Table of Contents Rental Revenues. We record rental revenue from long-term operating leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our bad-debt reserves, then we may have to recognize additional bad debt charges in future periods. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The analysis below includes changes attributable to acquisitions, development activity and divestitures and the changes resulting from properties that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development properties prior to being stabilized (generally defined as 90% leased or 12 months after we receive a certificate of occupancy for the building). We refer to these properties as the same store properties. For the comparison between the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 60.2 million square feet. The properties acquired in 2000 consisted of 145 buildings, aggregating approximately 10.5 million square feet, and the properties acquired during 2001 consisted of 65 buildings, aggregating 6.8 million square feet. In 2000, property divestitures consisted of one retail center and 25 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 2.5 million square feet, and property divestitures during 2001 consisted of 24 industrial and two retail buildings, aggregating approximately 3.2 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical rates. For the Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 Rental Revenues 2001 2000 $ Change % Change (Dollars in millions) Same store $ 400.2 $ 376.7 $ 23.5 6.2 % 2000 acquisitions 97.1 25.6 71.5 279.3 % 2001 acquisitions 22.8 — 22.8 — Developments 27.0 14.6 12.4 84.9 % Divestitures 10.9 37.1 (26.2 ) (70.6 )% Straight-line rents 10.1 10.2 (0.1 ) (1.0 )% Total $ 568.1 $ 464.2 $ 103.9 22.4 % The growth in rental revenues in same store properties resulted primarily from the incremental effect of cash rental rate increases on renewals and rollovers, fixed rent increases on existing leases, and reimbursement of expenses, partially offset by lower average occupancies. During 2001, the same store rent increases on industrial renewals and rollovers (cash basis) was 23.5% on 10.0 million square feet leased.

The $9.8 million increase in interest and other income was primarily due to interest income from our mortgage note on the retail center that we sold in 2000 and from interest income resulting from higher average cash balances. 21 Table of Contents Property Operating Expenses and Real Estate Taxes 2001 2000 $ Change % Change (Exclusive of depreciation and amortization) Rental expenses $ 69.0 $ 50.6 $ 18.4 36.4 % Real estate taxes 69.2 57.2 12.0 21.0 % Property operating expenses $ 138.2 $ 107.8 $ 30.4 28.2 % Same store $ 93.2 $ 87.2 $ 6.0 6.9 % 2000 acquisitions 27.9 7.1 20.8 293.0 % 2001 acquisitions 4.4 — 4.4 — Developments 9.6 4.3 5.3 123.3 % Divestitures 3.1 9.2 (6.1 ) (66.3 )% Total $ 138.2 $ 107.8 $ 30.4 28.2 % The increase in same store properties’ operating expenses primarily relates to increases in common area maintenance expenses of $2.3 million, real estate taxes of $2.5 million, and insurance expense of $0.8 million.

The secured debt issuances were primarily for our co-investment joint ventures’ properties. The increase in depreciation expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased personnel and occupancy costs. In addition, the consolidation of AMB Investment Management, Inc. (predecessor-in-interest to AMB Capital Partners, LLC) and Headlands Realty Corporation on May 31, 2001, resulted in an increase in general and administrative expenses of $4.9 million. During 2001, we recognized $20.8 million of losses on investments in other companies, related to our investment in Webvan Group, Inc. and other technology-related companies. The loss reflects a 100% write-down of the book value of the investments. During 2001, we retired $55.2 million of secured debt prior to maturity primarily in connection with property divestitures and early prepayments. We recognized a net extraordinary loss of $0.6 million related to the early retirement of debt, resulting from prepayment penalties, partially offset by the write-off of debt premiums.

During 2000, the same store base rents increase on renewals and rollovers (cash basis) was 28.0% on 9.8 million square feet leased.

The increase in depreciation expense was primarily due to lower than normal depreciation expense in 1999 and increases in our investments in real estate. Under the required accounting for assets held for sale, we discontinued depreciation of a substantial portion of our retail portfolio after we committed to dispose of a portion of the portfolio in March 1999. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was due to increased allocations to AMB Investment Management, Inc. (predecessor-in-interest to AMB Capital Partners, LLC), partially offset by increased personnel costs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion, and renovation of properties will include: (1) cash flow from operations; (2) borrowings under our unsecured credit facility; (3) other forms of secured or unsecured financing; (4) proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries); and (5) net proceeds from divestitures of properties. Additionally, we believe that our private capital co-investment program will also continue to serve as a source of capital for acquisitions and developments. We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow 23 Table of Contents from operations and borrowings available under our unsecured credit facility, and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. Capital Resources Property Divestitures. In 2001, we divested ourselves of 24 industrial and two retail buildings for an aggregate price of $193.4 million, with a resulting net gain of $24.1 million, net of minority interest partners’ share. Properties Held for Divestiture. We have decided to divest ourselves of three industrial properties and seven retail centers, which are not in our core markets or which do not meet our strategic objectives. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. As of December 31, 2001, the net carrying value of the properties held for divestiture was $157.2 million. Co-investment Joint Ventures. We consolidate the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of our five co-investment joint ventures. We consolidate these joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because we are the sole managing general partner and, as a result, control all of the major operating decisions. Third-party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2001, we owned approximately 26.9 million square feet of our properties through these entities. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. The inability to obtain new joint venture partners could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. During 2001, we contributed $539.2 million in operating properties, consisting of 111 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 10.8 million square feet, to three of our co-investment joint ventures. We recognized a gain of $17.8 million related to these contributions, representing the portion of the contributed properties acquired by the third party co-investors. We formed AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P. to acquire, develop, and redevelop distribution facilities nationwide, in which AMB Institutional Alliance REIT II, Inc. became a partner on June 28, 2001. As of December 31, 2001, the Alliance Fund II had received total equity commitments from third party investors of $195.4 million, which, when combined with anticipated debt financings and our investment, creates a total planned capitalization of $488.6 million. We are the managing general partner of the Alliance Fund II and owned, as of December 31, 2001, approximately 20% of the co-investment joint venture. We formed AMB-SGP, L.P. with a subsidiary of GIC Real Estate Pte Ltd., the real estate investment subsidiary of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, to own and operate, through a private real estate investment trust, distribution facilities nationwide. On March 23, 2001, AMB-SGP, L.P. received an equity contribution from GIC of $75.0 million, which, when combined with anticipated debt financings and our investment, creates a total planned capitalization of $335.0 million. We are the managing general partner of AMB-SGP, L.P. and owned, as of December 31, 2001, approximately 50.3% of the co-investment joint venture. We formed AMB Partners II, L.P. with the City and County of San Francisco Employees’ Retirement System to acquire, develop, and redevelop distribution facilities nationwide. On February 14, 2001, Partners II received an equity contribution from CCSFERS of $50.0 million, which, when combined with anticipated debt financings and our investment, creates a total planned capitalization of $250.0 million. We are the managing general partner of Partners II and owned, as of December 31, 2001, approximately 50% of the co-investment joint venture. The operating partnership, together with one of our other affiliates, owns, as of December 31, 2001, approximately 21% of the partnership interests in AMB Institutional Alliance Fund I, L.P. The Alliance Fund I is a co-investment partnership between the operating partnership and AMB Institutional Alliance REIT I, Inc., which includes 15 institutional investors as stockholders, and is engaged in the acquisition, ownership, operation, management, renovation, expansion, and development of industrial buildings in target markets 24 Table of Contents nationwide. As of December 31, 2001, the Alliance Fund I had received equity contributions from third party investors totaling $169.0 million, which, when combined with debt financings and our investment, creates a total capitalization of $378.0 million. The operating partnership, together with one of our other affiliates, owns, as of December 31, 2001, approximately 50% of the partnership interests in AMB/ Erie. L.P. Erie is a co-investment partnership between the operating partnership and various entities related to Erie Indemnity Company, and is engaged in the acquisition, ownership, operation, management, renovation, expansion, and development of industrial buildings in target markets nationwide. As of December 31, 2001, Erie had received equity contributions from third party investors totaling $13.7 million, which, when combined with debt financings and our investment, created a total capitalization of $129.0 million. Credit Facilities. In May 2000, the operating partnership entered into a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit agreement. We guarantee the operating partnership’s obligations under the credit facility. The credit facility matures in May 2003, has a one-year extension option, and is subject to a 15 basis point annual facility fee, which is based on our credit rating. The operating partnership has the ability to increase available borrowings to $700.0 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase its commitments. We use our unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions and for general working capital requirements. Borrowings under our credit facility currently bear interest at LIBOR plus 75 basis points, which is based on our credit rating. Increases in interest rates on this indebtedness could increase our interest expense, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Accordingly, in the future, we may engage in transactions to limit our exposure to rising interest rates. As of December 31, 2001, there was an outstanding balance of $12.0 million on our unsecured credit facility. Monthly debt service payments on our credit facility are interest only. The total amount available under our credit facility fluctuates based upon the borrowing base, as defined in the agreement governing the credit facility. At December 31, 2001, the remaining amount available under our unsecured credit facility was $488.0 million (excluding the additional $200.0 million of potential additional capacity). In July 2001, the Alliance Fund II obtained a $150.0 million credit facility from Bank of America N.A. Borrowings currently bear interest at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points. As of December 31, 2001, the outstanding balance was $123.5 million and the remaining amount available was $26.5 million. The credit facility is secured by the unfunded capital commitments of the third party investors in the Alliance REIT II and the Alliance Fund II. Equity. In December 2001, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased all of its outstanding 2,200,000 8.75% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units from three institutional investors. The units were redeemed for an aggregate cost of $115.7 million, including accrued and unpaid dividends totaling $1.3 million and a premium of $4.4 million. The Series C Preferred Units had a par value of $110.0 million. In September 2001, the operating partnership issued and sold 800,000 7.95% Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a price of $50.00 per unit in a private placement. Distributions are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears. The Series J Preferred Units are redeemable by the operating partnership on or after September 21, 2006, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $50.00 per unit, plus accumulated and unpaid distributions thereon, if any, to the redemption date. The Series J Preferred Units are exchangeable, at specified times and subject to certain conditions, on a one-for-one basis, for shares of our Series J Preferred Stock. The operating partnership used the net proceeds of $38.9 million for general corporate purposes, which may include the partial repayment of indebtedness or the acquisition or development of additional properties. In March 2001, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, issued and sold 510,000 8.00% Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a price of $50.00 per unit in a private placement. Distributions are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears at a rate per unit equal to $4.00 per annum. The Series I Preferred Units are redeemable by AMB Property II, L.P. on or after March 21, 2006, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $50.00 per unit, 25 Table of Contents plus accumulated and unpaid distributions thereon, if any, to the redemption date. The Series I Preferred Units are exchangeable, at specified times and subject to certain conditions, on a one-for-one basis, for shares of our Series I Preferred Stock. AMB Property II, L.P. used the net proceeds of $24.9 million to repay advances from the operating partnership and to make a loan to the operating partnership. The operating partnership used the funds to partially repay borrowings under its unsecured credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The loan bears interest at 8.0% per annum and is payable on demand. During 2001, we redeemed 223,092 and 635,798 common limited partnership units of the operating partnership for cash and shares of our common stock, respectively. Our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program in 1999 for the repurchase of up to $100.0 million worth of our common stock. During 2001, we repurchased 1,392,600 shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $23.62 per share under the program. Under the program to date, we have repurchased 2,836,200 shares our common stock at an average purchase price of $21.22 per share. Our stock repurchase program expired in December 2001. Our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $100.0 million worth of our common stock. The new stock repurchase program expires in December 2003 and no repurchases were made under the new program in 2001. Debt. As of December 31, 2001, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.2 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $6.8 million. The secured debt bears interest at rates varying from 4.0% to 10.6% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 7.3%) and final maturity dates ranging from February 2002 to June 2023. All of the secured debt bears interest at fixed rates, except for three loans with an aggregate principal amount of $52.4 million as of December 31, 2001, which bear interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% at December 31, 2001). In August 2000, the operating partnership commenced a medium-term note program for the issuance of up to $400.0 million in principal amount of medium-term notes, which will be guaranteed by us. As of December 31, 2001, the operating partnership had issued $380.0 million of medium-term notes under this program, leaving $20.0 million available for issuance. However, on January 14, 2002, the operating partnership issued and sold the remaining $20.0 million of the notes under this program to Lehman Brothers, Inc., as principal. We have guaranteed the notes, which mature on January 17, 2007, and bear interest at 5.90% per annum. The operating partnership used the net proceeds of $19.9 million for general corporate purposes, to partially repay indebtedness, and to acquire and develop additional properties. In January 2001, the operating partnership issued and sold $25.0 million of the notes under this program to A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc., as principal. We have guaranteed the notes, which mature on January 30, 2006, and bear interest at 6.90% per annum. The operating partnership used the net proceeds of $24.9 million for general corporate purposes, to partially repay indebtedness, and to acquire and develop additional properties. In March 2001, the operating partnership issued and sold $50.0 million of the notes under this program to First Union Securities, Inc., as principal. We have guaranteed the notes, which mature on March 7, 2011, and bear interest at 7.00% per annum. The operating partnership used the net proceeds of $49.7 million for general corporate purposes, to partially repay indebtedness, and to acquire and develop additional properties. In September 2001, the operating partnership issued and sold $25.0 million of the notes under this program to Lehman Brothers, Inc., as principal. We have guaranteed the notes, which mature on September 6, 2011, and bear interest at 6.75% per annum. The operating partnership used the net proceeds of $24.8 million for general corporate purposes and to acquire and develop additional properties. We guarantee the operating partnership’s obligations with respect to the senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions, then we expect that our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay all such maturing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, if we mortgage one or more of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, 26 Table of Contents then the property could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value. A foreclosure on one or more of our properties could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Mortgage Receivables. In September 2000, we sold our retail center located in Los Angeles, California. As of December 31, 2001, we carried a 9.50% mortgage note in the principal amount of $74.0 million on the retail center. The maturity date of the mortgage note, which was originally scheduled to mature on October 1, 2001, has been extended to September 30, 2002. Through a wholly-owned subsidiary, we also hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2001, the outstanding balance on the note was $13.2 million. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend to operate with a debt-to-total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. At December 31, 2001, our debt-to-total market capitalization ratio was 44.7%. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. In spite of these policies, our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our board of directors could alter or eliminate these policies or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies.

We also had $26.5 million of additional available borrowing under our Alliance Fund II credit facility. To fund acquisitions, development activities, and capital expenditures and to provide for general working capital requirements, we intend to use: (1) cash from operations; (2) borrowings under our credit facility; (3) other forms of secured and unsecured financing; (4) proceeds from any future debt or equity offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries); (5) proceeds from divestitures of properties; and (6) private capital. The unavailability of capital would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. 28 Table of Contents Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ending December 31, 2001, of $0.395 per share of common stock and the operating partnership declared a regular cash distribution for the quarter ending December 31, 2001, of $0.395 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on December 24, 2001, to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 14, 2001. The Series A, B, E, F, G, and J preferred stock and unit dividends and distributions were also payable on January 15, 2002, to stockholders and unitholders of record on January 4, 2002. The Series D, H, and I preferred unit distributions were payable on December 25, 2001, to unitholders of record on December 10, 2001.

Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Commitments Developments. In addition to recurring capital expenditures, which consist of building improvements and leasing costs incurred to renew or re-tenant space, as of December 31, 2001, we are developing 12 projects representing a total estimated investment of $154.4 million upon completion and two development projects available for sale representing a total estimated investment of $50.0 million upon completion. Of this total, $127.3 million had been funded as of December 31, 2001, and an estimated $77.1 million is required to complete current and planned projects. We expect to fund these expenditures with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facility, debt or equity issuances, and net proceeds from property divestitures, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms for development projects and we may not complete construction on schedule or within budget, resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs and delays in leasing such properties and generating cash flow. This could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We have no other material capital commitments. Acquisitions. During 2001, we invested $428.3 million in 65 operating industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 6.8 million rentable square feet. We funded these acquisitions and initiated development and renovation projects through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facility, cash, debt and equity issuances, and net proceeds from property divestitures. 29 Table of Contents Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels with periods up to 40 years and a lease on a building in New York City. Future minimum rental payments required under non-cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2001, were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2002 $ 6,823 2003 7,720 2004 7,921 2005 8,159 2006 8,480 Thereafter 146,335 $ 185,438 These operating lease payments are being amortized ratably over the terms of the related leases. Captive Insurance Company. We have responded to recent trends towards increasing costs and decreasing coverage availability in the insurance markets by obtaining higher-deductible property insurance from third party insurers and by forming a wholly-owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in December 2001. Arcata will generally provide insurance coverage for losses below the increased deductible under the third party policies. Premiums paid to Arcata have a retrospective component, so that if expenses, including losses, are less than premiums collected, the excess will be returned to the property owners (and, in turn, as appropriate, to the customers) and conversely, if expenses, including losses, are greater than premiums collected, an additional premium, not in excess of the difference, will be charged. Through this structure, we believe that we have been able to obtain insurance for our portfolio with more comprehensive coverage at a projected overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Unknown Liabilities. Unknown liabilities may include the following: (1) liabilities for clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; (2) claims of customers, vendors, or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation transactions; (3) accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; (4) tax liabilities; and (5) claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. Funds From Operations We believe that funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, is an appropriate measure of performance for a real estate investment trust. While funds from operations is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance. Further, funds from operations as disclosed by other real estate investment trusts may not be comparable. FFO is defined as income from operations before minority interest, gains or losses from sale of real estate, and extraordinary items plus real estate depreciation and adjustment to derive our pro rata share of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures, less minority interests’ pro rata share of FFO of consolidated joint ventures and perpetual preferred stock dividends. In accordance with the NAREIT White Paper on funds from operations, we include the effects of straight-line rents in funds from operations. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non-recurring charges. 30 Table of Contents The following table reflects the calculation of funds from operations for the years ended December 31, (dollars in thousands): 2001 2000 1999 Income before minority interests $ 165,672 $ 165,599 $ 159,321 Gains on developments held for sale 13,169 — — Real estate related depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 111,414 90,358 67,035 Furniture, fixtures, and equipment depreciation and ground lease amortization(1) (1,963 ) (1,114 ) (1,002 ) FFO attributable to minority interests(2) (40,144 ) (15,055 ) (8,182 ) Adjustments to derive FFO in unconsolidated joint venture(3): Our share of net income (5,467 ) (5,212 ) (4,701 ) Our share of FFO 8,014 7,188 6,677 Series A preferred stock dividends (8,500 ) (8,500 ) (8,500 ) Preferred unit distributions (28,682 ) (24,613 ) (19,501 ) FFO $ 213,513 $ 208,651 $ 191,147 (1) Ground lease amortization represents the amortization of our investments in ground lease properties, for which we do not have a purchase option. (2) Represents FFO attributable to minority interests in consolidated joint ventures whose interests are not exchangeable into common stock. The minority interests’ share of net operating income for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, was $65.0 million, $25.0 million, and $12.5 million, respectively. (3) Our share of net operating income for years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, was $10.2 million, $8.3 million, and $8.0 million, respectively. BUSINESS RISKS Our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences to us. These risks include, among others: General Real Estate Risks There Are Factors Outside of Our Control that Affect the Performance and Value of Our Properties Real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk. The yields available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated by the related properties as well as the expenses incurred in connection with the properties. If our properties do not generate income sufficient to meet operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, then our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders could be adversely affected. Income from, and the value of, our properties may be adversely affected by the general economic climate, local conditions such as oversupply of industrial space, or a reduction in demand for industrial space, the attractiveness of our properties to potential customers, competition from other properties, our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance, and an increase in operating costs. Periods of economic slowdown or recession in the United States and in other countries, rising interest rates, or declining demand for real estate, or public perception that any of these events may occur would result in a general decrease in rents or an increased occurrence of defaults under existing leases, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future terrorist attacks in the United States may result in declining economic activity, which could harm the demand for and the value of our properties. To the extent that our customers are impacted by future attacks, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to honor their existing leases. Our properties are currently concentrated predominantly in the industrial real estate sector. Our concentration in a certain property type exposes us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a 31 Table of Contents greater extent than if our portfolio also included other property types. As a result of such concentration, economic downturns in the industrial real estate sector could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, revenues from properties and real estate values are also affected by factors such as the cost of compliance with regulations, the potential for liability under applicable laws (including changes in tax laws), interest rate levels, and the availability of financing. Our income would be adversely affected if a significant number of customers were unable to pay rent or if we were unable to rent our industrial space on favorable terms. Certain significant expenditures associated with an investment in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes, and maintenance costs) generally do not decline when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property. We May Be Unable to Renew Leases or Relet Space as Leases Expire We are subject to the risks that leases may not be renewed, space may not be relet, or the terms of renewal or reletting (including the cost of required renovations) may be less favorable than current lease terms. Leases on a total of 14.9% of our industrial properties (based on annualized base rent) as of December 31, 2001, will expire on or prior to December 31, 2002. In addition, numerous properties compete with our properties in attracting customers to lease space, particularly with respect to retail centers. The number of competitive commercial properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space in our properties and on the rents that we are able to charge. Our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected if we are unable to promptly relet or renew the leases for all or a substantial portion of expiring leases, if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting is significantly lower than expected, or if our reserves for these purposes prove inadequate. Real Estate Investments are Illiquid Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions is limited. The limitations in the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations on a real estate investment trust holding property for sale may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting dividends to our stockholders. The relative illiquidity of our holdings and Internal Revenue Code prohibitions and related regulations could impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. A Significant Number of Our Properties Are Located in California Our industrial properties located in California as of December 31, 2001, represented approximately 28.7% of the aggregate square footage of our industrial operating properties as of December 31, 2001, and 35.9% of our annualized base rent. Annualized base rent means the monthly contractual amount under existing leases as of December 31, 2001, multiplied by 12. This amount excludes expense reimbursements and rental abatements. Our revenue from, and the value of, our properties located in California may be affected by a number of factors, including local real estate conditions (such as oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties) and the local economic climate. Business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics, and other factors may adversely impact the local economic climate. A downturn in either the California economy or in California real estate conditions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Certain of our properties are also subject to possible loss from seismic activity. Some Potential Losses Are not Covered by Insurance We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, and rental loss insurance covering all of our properties, with policy specifications and insured limits that we believe are adequate and appropriate under the circumstances given relative risk of loss, the cost of such coverage, and industry practice. There are, however, certain losses that are not generally insured because it is not economically feasible to insure against them, 32 Table of Contents including losses due to acts of terrorism, riots or acts of war. Certain losses such as losses due to floods or seismic activity may be insured subject to certain limitations including large deductibles or co-payments and policy limits. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, then we could lose the capital we invested in the properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the properties and, in the case of debt, which is with recourse to us, we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties. Moreover, as the general partner of the operating partnership, we generally will be liable for all of the operating partnership’s unsatisfied obligations other than non-recourse obligations, including any obligations incurred by the operating partnership as the general partner of the co-investment joint ventures. Any such liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. A number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity, including California where, as of December 31, 2001, 291 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 23.4 million square feet (representing 28.7% of our industrial operating properties based on aggregate square footage and 35.9% based on annualized base rent) are located. We carry replacement cost earthquake insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. This insurance coverage also applies to the properties managed by AMB Capital Partners, LLC, with a single aggregate policy limit and deductible applicable to those properties and our properties. Through an annual analysis prepared by outside consultants, we evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage in light of current industry practice and determine the appropriate amount of earthquake insurance to carry. We may incur material losses in excess of insurance proceeds and we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance at commercially reasonable rates. We Are Subject to Risks and Liabilities In Connection With Properties Owned Through Joint Ventures, Limited Liability Companies, and Partnerships As of December 31, 2001, we had ownership interests in several joint ventures, limited liability companies, or partnerships with third parties, as well as interests in three unconsolidated entities. As of December 31, 2001, we owned approximately 34.1 million square feet (excluding three unconsolidated joint ventures) of our properties through these entities. We may make additional investments through these ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. Such partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions. Partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture investments may involve risks such as the following: (1) our partners, co-members, or joint venturers might become bankrupt (in which event we and any other remaining general partners, members, or joint venturers would generally remain liable for the liabilities of the partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture); (2) our partners, co-members, or joint venturers might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals; (3) our partners, co-members, or joint venturers may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions, requests, policies, or objectives, including our current policy with respect to maintaining our qualification as a real estate investment trust; and (4) agreements governing joint ventures, limited liability companies, and partnerships often contain restrictions on the transfer of a joint venturer’s, member’s, or partner’s interest or “buy-sell” or other provisions, which may result in a purchase or sale of the interest at a disadvantageous time or on disadvantageous terms. We will, however, generally seek to maintain sufficient control of our partnerships, limited liability companies, and joint ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in partnerships, limited liability companies, or joint ventures. The occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We May be Unable to Consummate Acquisitions on Advantageous Terms We intend to continue to acquire primarily industrial properties. Acquisitions of properties entail risks that investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations. Estimates of the costs of improvements 33 Table of Contents necessary for us to bring an acquired property up to market standards may prove inaccurate. In addition, there are general investment risks associated with any real estate investment. Further, we anticipate significant competition for attractive investment opportunities from other major real estate investors with significant capital including both publicly traded real estate investment trusts and private institutional investment funds. We expect that future acquisitions will be financed through a combination of borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units by the operating partnership or its subsidiaries), and proceeds from property divestitures, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. We may not be able to acquire additional properties. Our inability to finance any future acquisitions on favorable terms or the failure of acquisitions to conform with our expectations or investment criteria, or our failure to timely reinvest the proceeds from property divestitures could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We May be Unable to Complete Renovation and Development on Advantageous Terms The real estate development business, including the renovation and rehabilitation of existing properties, involves significant risks. These risks include the following: (1) we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms for development projects and we may not complete construction on schedule or within budget, resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs and delays in leasing such properties and generating cash flow; (2) we may not be able to obtain, or we may experience delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other required governmental permits and authorizations; (3) new or renovated properties may perform below anticipated levels, producing cash flow below budgeted amounts; (4) substantial renovation as well as new development activities, regardless of whether or not they are ultimately successful, typically require a substantial portion of management’s time and attention that could divert management’s time from our day-to-day operations; and (5) activities that we finance through construction loans involve the risk that, upon completion of construction, we may not be able to obtain permanent financing or we may not be able to obtain permanent financing on advantageous terms. These risks could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We May be Unable to Complete Divestitures on Advantageous Terms We have decided to divest ourselves of four retail centers and one industrial property, which are not in our core markets or which do not meet our strategic objectives. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. Our ability to dispose of properties on advantageous terms is dependent upon factors beyond our control, including competition from other owners (including other real estate investment trusts) that are attempting to dispose of industrial and retail properties and the availability of financing on attractive terms for potential buyers of our properties. Our inability to dispose of properties on favorable terms or our inability to redeploy the proceeds of property divestitures in accordance with our investment strategy could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Debt Financing We Could Incur More Debt We operate with a policy of incurring debt, either directly or through our subsidiaries, only if upon such incurrence our debt-to-total market capitalization ratio would be approximately 45% or less. The aggregate amount of indebtedness that we may incur under our policy varies directly with the valuation of our capital stock and the number of shares of capital stock outstanding. Accordingly, we would be able to incur additional indebtedness under our policy as a result of increases in the market price per share of our common stock or other outstanding classes of capital stock, and future issuance of shares of our capital stock. However, our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our board of directors could alter or eliminate this policy. If we change this policy, then we could 34 Table of Contents become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Scheduled Debt Payments Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition We are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risks that cash flow will be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders, that we will be unable to refinance existing indebtedness on our properties (which in all cases will not have been fully amortized at maturity) and that the terms of refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. As of December 31, 2001, we had total debt outstanding of approximately $2.1 billion. In addition, we guarantee the operating partnership’s obligations with respect to the senior debt securities referenced in our financial statements. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions, then we expect that our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay all such maturing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, if we mortgage one or more of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, then the property could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value. A foreclosure on one or more of our properties could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Rising Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect Our Cash Flow As of December 31, 2001, we had $123.5 million outstanding under our Alliance Fund II secured credit facility, $12.0 million outstanding under our unsecured credit facility, and we had four secured loans with an aggregate principal amount of $52.4 million, which bear interest at variable rates (with weighted average interest rate of 3.8% as of December 31, 2001). In addition, we may incur other variable rate indebtedness in the future. Increases in interest rates on this indebtedness could increase our interest expense, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Accordingly, in the future, we may engage in transactions to limit our exposure to rising interest rates. We Are Dependent on External Sources of Capital In order to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain) and we are subject to tax on our income to the extent it is not distributed. Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs, including capital needs in connection with acquisitions, from cash retained from operations. As a result, to fund capital needs, we rely on third party sources of capital, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms or at all. Our access to third party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors, including: (1) general market conditions; (2) the market’s perception of our growth potential; (3) our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and (4) the market price of our capital stock. Additional debt financing may substantially increase our debt-to-total capitalization ratio. We Could Default on Cross-Collateralized and Cross-Defaulted Debt As of December 31, 2001, we had 22 non-recourse secured loans, which are cross collateralized by 48 properties. As of December 31, 2001, we had $551.9 million (not including unamortized debt premium) outstanding on these loans. If we default on any of these loans, then we could be required to repay the 35 Table of Contents aggregate of all indebtedness, together with applicable prepayment charges, to avoid foreclosure on all the cross-collateralized properties within the applicable pool. Foreclosure on our properties, or our inability to refinance our loans on favorable terms, could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, our credit facilities and the senior debt securities of the operating partnership contain certain cross-default provisions, which are triggered in the event that our other material indebtedness is in default. These cross-default provisions may require us to repay or restructure the credit facilities and the senior debt securities in addition to any mortgage or other debt that is in default, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Contingent or Unknown Liabilities Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition Our predecessors have been in existence for varying lengths of time up to 18 years. At the time of our formation we acquired the assets of these entities subject to all of their potential existing liabilities. There may be current liabilities or future liabilities arising from prior activities that we are not aware of and therefore have not disclosed in this report. We assumed these liabilities as the surviving entity in the various merger and contribution transactions that occurred at the time of our formation. Existing liabilities for indebtedness generally were taken into account in connection with the allocation of the operating partnership’s limited partnership units or shares of our common stock in the formation transactions, but no other liabilities were taken into account for these purposes. We do not have recourse against our predecessors or any of their respective stockholders or partners or against any individual account investors with respect to any unknown liabilities. Unknown liabilities might include the following: (1) liabilities for clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; (2) claims of customers, vendors, or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to the formation transactions that had not been asserted prior to the formation transactions; (3) accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; (4) tax liabilities; and (5) claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. Certain customers may claim that the formation transactions gave rise to a right to purchase the premises that they occupy. We do not believe any such claims would be material and, to date, no such claims have been filed. See “— Government Regulations — We Could Encounter Costly Environmental Problems” below regarding the possibility of undisclosed environmental conditions potentially affecting the value of our properties. Undisclosed material liabilities in connection with the acquisition of properties, entities and interests in properties, or entities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Our Access to Timely Financial Reporting and to Capital Markets May be Impaired if Arthur Andersen LLP is Unable to Perform Required Audit-Related Services On March 14, 2002, our independent public accountant, Arthur Andersen LLP, was indicted on federal obstruction of justice charges arising from the U.S. government’s investigation of Enron Corporation. Arthur Andersen LLP has indicated that it intends to contest vigorously the indictment. The Securities and Exchange Commission has said that it will continue accepting financial statements audited by Arthur Andersen LLP, and interim financial statements reviewed by it, so long as Arthur Andersen LLP is able to make certain representations to its clients. Our access to the capital markets and our ability to make timely filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could be impaired if the Securities and Exchange Commission ceases accepting financial statements audited by Arthur Andersen LLP, if Arthur Andersen LLP becomes unable to make the required representations to us or if for any other reason Arthur Andersen LLP is unable to perform required audit-related services for us. However, we believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations and borrowings available under our unsecured credit facility, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. 36 Table of Contents Conflicts of Interest Some of Our Directors and Executive Officers Are Involved in Other Real Estate Activities and Investments Some of our executive officers own interests in real estate-related businesses and investments. These interests include minority ownership of Institutional Housing Partners, L.P., a residential housing finance company, and ownership of Aspire Development, Inc. and Aspire Development, L.P., developers that own property not suitable for ownership by us. Aspire Development, Inc. and Aspire Development, L.P. have agreed not to initiate any new development projects not contemplated at our initial public offering in November 1997. These entities have also agreed that they will not make any further investments in industrial properties other than those currently under development at the time of our initial public offering. The continued involvement in other real estate-related activities by some of our executive officers and directors could divert management’s attention from our day-to-day operations. Most of our executive officers have entered into non-competition agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed not to engage in any activities, directly or indirectly, in respect of commercial real estate, and not to make any investment in respect of industrial real estate, other than through ownership of not more than 5% of the outstanding shares of a public company engaged in such activities or through the existing investments referred to in this report. State law may limit our ability to enforce these agreements. Certain of Our Executive Officers and Directors May Have Conflicts of Interest with Us in Connection with Other Properties that They Own or Control As of December 31, 2001, Aspire Development, L.P. owns interests in three retail development projects in the U.S., one of which is a single freestanding Walgreens drugstore and two of which are Walgreens drugstores plus shop buildings, which are less than 10,000 feet. In addition, Messrs. Moghadam and Burke, each a founder and director, own less than 1% interests in two partnerships that own office buildings in various markets; these interests have negligible value. Luis A. Belmonte, an executive officer, owns less than a 10% interest, representing an estimated value of $150,000, in a limited partnership, which owns an office building located in Oakland, California. In addition, several of our executive officers individually own: (1) less than 1% interests in the stocks of certain publicly-traded real estate investment trusts; (2) certain interests in and rights to developed and undeveloped real property located outside the United States; and (3) certain other de minimus holdings in equity securities of real estate companies. Thomas W. Tusher, a member of our board of directors, is a limited partner in a partnership in which Messrs. Moghadam and Burke are general partners and which owns a 75% interest in an office building. Mr. Tusher owns a 20% interest in the partnership, valued at approximately $1.7 million. Messrs. Moghadam and Burke each have a 26.7% interest in the partnership, each valued at approximately $2.2 million. We believe that the properties and activities set forth above generally do not directly compete with any of our properties. However, it is possible that a property in which an executive officer or director, or an affiliate of an executive officer or director, has an interest may compete with us in the future if we were to invest in a property similar in type and in close proximity to that property. In addition, the continued involvement by our executive officers and directors in these properties could divert management’s attention from our day-to-day operations. Our policy prohibits us from acquiring any properties from our executive officers or their affiliates without the approval of the disinterested members of our board of directors with respect to that transaction. Our Role as General Partner of the Operating Partnership May Conflict with the Interests of Stockholders As the general partner of the operating partnership, we have fiduciary obligations to the operating partnership’s limited partners, the discharge of which may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, those persons holding limited partnership units will have the right to vote as a class on certain amendments to the partnership agreement of the operating partnership and individually to approve certain 37 Table of Contents amendments that would adversely affect their rights. The limited partners may exercise these voting rights in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, under the terms of the operating partnership’s partnership agreement, holders of limited partnership units will have certain approval rights with respect to certain transactions that affect all stockholders but which they may not exercise in a manner that reflects the interests of all stockholders. Our Directors, Executive Officers, and Significant Stockholders Could Act in a Manner that is Not in the Best Interest of All Stockholders As of March 20, 2002, we believe that our two largest stockholders, Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. (with respect to various client accounts for which Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. serves as investment advisor) and ABP Investments U.S. (with respect to various client accounts for which ABP Investments U.S. serves as investment advisor) beneficially owned 14.0% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, our executive officers and directors beneficially owned 4.3% of our outstanding common stock as of March 20, 2002, and will have influence on our management and operation and, as stockholders, will have influence on the outcome of any matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. This influence might be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other stockholders. Although there is no understanding or arrangement for these directors, officers, and stockholders and their affiliates to act in concert, these parties would be in a position to exercise significant influence over our affairs if they choose to do so. Government Regulations Many laws and governmental regulations are applicable to our properties and changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and the courts, occur frequently. Costs of Compliance with Americans with Disabilities Act Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act might require us to remove structural barriers to handicapped access in certain public areas where such removal is “readily achievable.” If we fail to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, then we might be required to pay fines to the government or damages to private litigants. The impact of application of the Americans with Disabilities Act to our properties, including the extent and timing of required renovations, is uncertain. If we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, then our cash flow and the amounts available for dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected. We Could Encounter Environmental Problems Federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment impose liability on a current or previous owner or operator of real estate for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at the property. A current or previous owner may be required to investigate and clean up contamination at or migrating from a site. These laws typically impose liability and clean-up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury, property damage, or other costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from environmental contamination present at or emanating from that site. Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of asbestos. These laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos, and that they undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or 38 Table of Contents demolition of a building. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failing to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers. Some of our properties may contain asbestos-containing building materials. Some of our properties are leased or have been leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use, store, or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. These operations create a potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. Some of our properties are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain of our properties are on, are adjacent to, or are near other properties upon which others, including former owners or customers of the properties, have engaged or may in the future engage in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. From time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and the acquisition will yield a superior risk-adjusted return. Environmental issues for each property are evaluated and quantified prior to acquisition. The costs of environmental investigation, clean-up, and monitoring are underwritten into the cost of the acquisition and appropriate environmental insurance is obtained for the property. In connection with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties. All of our properties were subject to a Phase I or similar environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants at the time of acquisition. Phase I assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties and include an historical review, a public records review, an investigation of the surveyed site and surrounding properties, and preparation and issuance of a written report. We may perform additional Phase II testing if recommended by the independent environmental consultant. Phase II testing may include the collection and laboratory analysis of soil and groundwater samples, completion of surveys for asbestos-containing building materials, and any other testing that the consultant considers prudent in order to test for the presence of hazardous materials. None of the environmental assessments of our properties has revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. Furthermore, we are not aware of any such material environmental liability. Nonetheless, it is possible that the assessments do not reveal all environmental liabilities and that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware or that known environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are materially greater than anticipated. Moreover, the current environmental condition of our properties may be affected by customers, the condition of land, operations in the vicinity of the properties (such as releases from underground storage tanks), or by third parties unrelated to us. If the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations exceed our budgets for these items, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. Our Financial Condition Could be Adversely Affected if We Fail to Comply with Other Regulations Our properties are also subject to various federal, state, and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, then we might incur fines by governmental authorities or be required to pay awards of damages to private litigants. We believe that our properties are currently in substantial compliance with all such regulatory requirements. However, these requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed, which could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us. Any such unanticipated expenditure could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. 39 Table of Contents Federal Income Tax Risks Our Failure to Qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust Would Have Serious Adverse Consequences to Stockholders We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. Qualification as a real estate investment trust requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we must derive at least 95% of our gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. These provisions and the applicable treasury regulations are more complicated in our case because we hold our assets through the operating partnership. Legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations, or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. However, we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to operate as a real estate investment trust. If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification. If we lose our real estate investment trust status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved. In addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. We Pay Some Taxes Even if we qualify as a real estate investment trust, we will be required to pay certain state and local taxes on our income and property. In addition, we will be required to pay federal and state income tax on the net taxable income, if any, from the activities conducted through AMB Capital Partners, LLC and Headlands Realty Corporation. AMB Capital Partners, LLC and Headlands Realty Corporation, as taxable REIT subsidiaries, are also subject to tax on their income, reducing their cash available for distribution to us. Certain Property Transfers May Generate Prohibited Transaction Income From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. Under the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction. We would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on that income. Since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we believe that any transfer or disposal of property by us would not be deemed by the Internal Revenue Service to be a prohibited transaction with any resulting gain allocable to us being subject to a 100% penalty tax. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. While we believe that the Internal Revenue Service would not prevail in any such dispute, if the IRS were to successfully argue that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay 40 Table of Contents a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, any income from a prohibited transaction may adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes. We Are Dependent On Our Key Personnel We depend on the efforts of our executive officers. While we believe that we could find suitable replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers. We May Be Unable to Manage Our Growth Our business has grown rapidly and continues to grow through property acquisitions and developments. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. We May Be Unable to Effectively Manage Our International Growth We may acquire properties in foreign countries. Local markets affect our operations and, therefore, we would be subject to economic fluctuations in foreign locations. Our international operations also would be subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as the revaluation of currencies, revisions in tax treaties or other laws governing the taxation of revenues, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and, in certain parts of the world, political instability. We cannot predict the likelihood that any such developments may occur. Further, we may enter into agreements with non-U.S. entities that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute resolution in, the courts of another country or region. We cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide us with an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that may arise. Even if we are able to obtain a satisfactory decision through arbitration or a court proceeding, we could have difficulty enforcing any award or judgment on a timely basis. Our business has grown rapidly and continues to grow through property acquisitions and developments. If we fail to effectively manage our international growth, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. Ownership of Our Stock Limitations in Our Charter and Bylaws Could Prevent a Change in Control Certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay, defer, or prevent a change in control or other transaction that could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for the common stock. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year after the first taxable year for which a real estate investment trust election is made. Furthermore, our common stock must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a 12-month taxable year (or a proportionate part of a short tax year). In addition, if we, or an owner of 10% or more of our stock, actually or constructively owns 10% or more of one of our customers (or a tenant of any partnership in which we are a partner), then the rent received by us (either directly or through any such partnership) from that tenant will not be qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment trust gross income tests of the Internal Revenue Code. To facilitate maintenance of our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, we will prohibit the ownership, actually or by virtue of the constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, by any single person of more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock and more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, and we will also prohibit the ownership, actually or constructively, of any shares of our other preferred stock by any single 41 Table of Contents person so that no such person, taking into account all of our stock so owned by such person, may own in excess of 9.8% of our issued and outstanding capital stock. We refer to this limitation as the “ownership limit.” Shares acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary. Any person who acquires shares in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the amount realized from the sale. A transfer of shares in violation of the above limits may be void under certain circumstances. The ownership limit may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control and, therefore, could adversely affect our stockholders’ ability to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for the shares of our common stock in connection with such transaction. Our charter authorizes us to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock and to establish the preferences, rights, and other terms of any series or class of preferred stock that we issue. Although our board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series or class of preferred stock that could delay, defer, or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. Our charter and bylaws and Maryland law also contain other provisions that may delay, defer, or prevent a transaction, including a change in control, that might involve payment of a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. Those provisions include the following: (1) the provision in the charter that directors may be removed only for cause and only upon a two-thirds vote of stockholders, together with bylaw provisions authorizing the board of directors to fill vacant directorships; (2) the provision in the charter requiring a two-thirds vote of stockholders for any amendment of the charter; (3) the requirement in the bylaws that the request of the holders of 50% or more of our common stock is necessary for stockholders to call a special meeting; (4) the requirement of Maryland law that stockholders may only take action by written consent with the unanimous approval of all stockholders entitled to vote on the matter in question; and (5) the requirement in the bylaws of advance notice by stockholders for the nomination of directors or proposal of business to be considered at a meeting of stockholders. These provisions may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of our board of directors, which in turn may delay, defer or prevent a transaction involving a change of control. We Could Change Our Investment and Financing Policies without a Vote of Stockholders Subject to our current investment policy to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust (unless a change is approved by our board of directors under certain circumstances), our board of directors will determine our investment and financing policies, our growth strategy and our debt, capitalization, distribution, and operating policies. Although the board of directors has no present intention to revise or amend these strategies and policies, the board of directors may do so at any time without a vote of stockholders. Accordingly, stockholders will have no control over changes in our strategies and policies (other than through the election of directors), and any such changes may not serve the interests of all stockholders and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, including our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. If We Issue Additional Securities, then the Investment of Existing Stockholders Will Be Diluted We have authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities in exchange for property or otherwise. Similarly, we may cause the operating partnership to issue additional limited partnership units in exchange for property or otherwise. Existing stockholders will have no preemptive right to acquire any additional securities issued by us or the operating partnership and any issuance of additional equity securities could result in dilution of an existing stockholder’s investment. 42 Table of Contents The Large Number of Shares Available for Future Sale Could Adversely Affect the Market Price of Our Common Stock We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of our common stock, or the availability of shares of our common stock for future sale, will have on its market price. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market (or upon exchange of limited partnership units in the operating partnership) or the perception that such sales (or exchanges) might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. All shares of common stock issuable upon the redemption of limited partnership units in the operating partnership will be deemed to be “restricted securities” within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act and may not be transferred unless registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration is available, including any exemption from registration provided under Rule 144. In general, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, Rule 144 permits the holder to sell certain amounts of restricted securities one year following the date of acquisition of the restricted securities from us and, after two years, permits unlimited sales by persons unaffiliated with us. Commencing generally on the first anniversary of the date of acquisition of common limited partnership units (or such other date agreed to by the operating partnership and the holders of the units), the operating partnership may redeem common limited partnership units at the request of the holders for cash (based on the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of common stock at the time of redemption) or, at the option of the operating partnership, exchange the common limited partnership units for an equal number of shares of our common stock, subject to certain antidilution adjustments. The operating partnership had issued and outstanding 4,969,027 common limited partnership units as of December 31, 2001. As of December 31, 2001, we had reserved 8,072,818 shares of common stock for issuance under our Stock Option and Incentive Plan (not including shares that we have already issued) and, as of December 31, 2001, we had granted to certain directors, officers, and employees options to purchase 7,437,219 shares of common stock (excluding forfeitures and 330,176 shares that we have issued pursuant to the exercise of options). As of December 31, 2001, we had granted 549,738 restricted shares of common stock, 2,732 of which have been forfeited. In addition, we may issue additional shares of common stock and the operating partnership may issue additional limited partnership units in connection with the acquisition of properties. In connection with the issuance of common limited partnership units to other transferors of properties, and in connection with the issuance of the performance units, we have agreed to file registration statements covering the issuance of shares of common stock upon the exchange of the common limited partnership units. We have also filed a registration statement with respect to the shares of common stock issuable under our Stock Option and Incentive Plan. These registration statements and registration rights generally allow shares of common stock covered thereby, including shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of limited partnership units, including performance units, or the exercise of options or restricted shares of common stock, to be transferred or resold without restriction under the Securities Act. We may also agree to provide registration rights to any other person who may become an owner of the operating partnership’s limited partnership units. Future sales of the shares of common stock described above could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The existence of the operating partnership’s limited partnership units, options, and shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange of limited partnership units, and the exercise of options and registration rights referred to above, also may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities. Various Market Conditions Affect the Price of Our Stock As with other publicly-traded equity securities, the market price of our stock will depend upon various market conditions, which may change from time to time. Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our stock are the following: (1) the extent of investor interest in us; (2) the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate-based companies); (3) our financial performance; (4) general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; and 43 Table of Contents (5) terrorist activity may adversely affect the markets in which our securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending. Other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws could also have a significant impact on the future market price of our stock. Earnings and Cash Dividends, Asset Value, and Market Interest Rates Affect the Price of Our Stock The market value of the equity securities of a real estate investment trust generally is based primarily upon the market’s perception of the real estate investment trust’s growth potential and its current and potential future earnings and cash dividends. It is based secondarily upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets. For that reason, shares of our stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share. To the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves, or other purposes, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not correspondingly increase the market price of our stock. Our failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of our stock. Another factor that may influence the price of our stock will be the distribution yield on the stock (as a percentage of the price of the stock) relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates might lead prospective purchasers of our stock to expect a higher distribution yield, which would adversely affect the market price of the stock. If the market price of our stock declines significantly, then we might breach certain covenants with respect to debt obligations, which might adversely affect our liquidity and ability to make future acquisitions and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. Item 7a. Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevalent market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing, and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes: (1) interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings; and (2) our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2001, we had no interest rate caps or swaps. See “Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Capital Resources — Market Capitalization.” The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rated debt outstanding before unamortized debt premiums of $6.8 million as of December 31, 2001: Expected Maturity Date Total 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 Thereafter Debt Fixed rate debt(1) $ 73,603 $ 89,319 $ 92,364 $ 350,029 $ 186,452 $ 1,149,166 $ 1,940,933 Average interest rate 8.3 % 7.8 % 8.0 % 7.3 % 7.3 % 7.5 % 7.5 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 23,093 $ 136,053 $ 20,526 $ 594 $ 7,629 — $ 187,895 Average interest rate 3.5 % 2.8 % 4.1 % 3.5 % 3.5 % — 3.0 % (1) Represents 91.2% of all outstanding debt.

1045609,PLD,"Prologis, Inc.",2003,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements. Statements contained in this discussion that are not historical facts may be forward-looking statements. Such statements relate to our future performance and plans, results of operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and operating improvements and costs. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “approximately,” “intends,” “plans,” “pro forma,” “estimates” or “anticipates,” or the negative of these words and phrases, or similar words or phrases. You can also identify forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Forward-looking statements involve numerous risks and uncertainties and you should not rely upon them as predictions of future events. There is no assurance that the events or circumstances reflected in forward-looking statements will occur or be achieved. Forward-looking statements are necessarily dependent on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and we may not be able to realize them. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements: • defaults or non-renewal of leases by customers; • increased interest rates and operating costs; • our failure to obtain necessary outside financing; • difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and in effecting acquisitions; • our failure to successfully integrate acquired properties and operations; • our failure to divest of properties that we have contracted to sell or to timely reinvest proceeds from any such divestitures; • risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including construction delays, cost overruns, our inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to these activities); • our failure to qualify and maintain our status as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; • environmental uncertainties; • risks related to natural disasters; • financial market fluctuations; • changes in real estate and zoning laws; • increases in real property tax rates; and • risks of doing business internationally, including currency risks. Our success also depends upon economic trends generally, including interest rates, income tax laws, governmental regulation, legislation, population changes and those other risk factors discussed in the section entitled “Business Risks” in this report. We caution you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect our analysis only and speak as of the date of this report or as of the dates indicated in the statements. GENERAL We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company in connection with the completion of our initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with our initial tax return for the year 21 ended December 31, 1997. AMB Property Corporation and the operating partnership were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering. We generate revenue primarily from rent received from customers under long-term operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs and our private capital business. In addition, our growth is, in part, dependent on our ability to increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties and our ability to continue the acquisition and development of additional properties. Although the weak economy has decreased customer demand for new space and has limited or in some cases lowered rent growth, many types of investors are acquiring industrial real estate. In 2002, we capitalized on this opportunity by accelerating our portfolio repositioning program through the disposition of properties. Our income would be adversely affected if a significant number of customers were unable to pay rent or if we were unable to rent our industrial space on favorable terms. Certain significant expenditures associated with an investment in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs) generally do not decline when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property. Moreover, as the general partner of the operating partnership, we generally will be liable for all of the operating partnership’s unsatisfied obligations other than non-recourse obligations, including the operating partnership’s obligations as the general partner of the co-investment joint ventures. Any such liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case, the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property-by-property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying amount of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future market conditions and the availability of capital. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying amount of our long-lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. Rental Revenues. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our bad-debt reserves, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional bad debt charges in future periods. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight-line rents, for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed. Historically, our bad debt expense has been between 50 and 150 basis points of total revenues. 22 Consolidated Joint Ventures. Minority interests represent the limited partnership interests in the operating partnership and interests held by certain third parties in several real estate joint ventures, aggregating approximately 33.8 million square feet, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes. Such investments are consolidated because we own a majority interest or we exercise significant control over major operating decisions such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, investment activity and changes in financing. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. We have non-controlling limited partnership interests in four separate unconsolidated joint ventures. These investments are not consolidated because we do not exercise significant control over major operating decisions such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, investment activity and changes in financing. We account for the joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. Stock-based Compensation Expense. In 2002, we adopted the expense recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. We value stock options issued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and recognize this value as an expense over the period in which the options vest. Under this standard, recognition of expense for stock options is retroactively applied to all options granted after the beginning of the year of adoption. Prior to 2002, we followed the intrinsic method set forth in APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. During 2002, we awarded 2.0 million stock options to employees. In accordance with SFAS No. 123, we will recognize the associated expense over the three to five-year vesting periods. The expense is included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. REIT Compliance. We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1997. In order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we must derive at least 95% of our gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. It is our current intention to adhere to these requirements and maintain our REIT status. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on net income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. As such, no provision for federal income taxes has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As a REIT, we still may be subject to certain state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be required to pay federal and state income tax on the net taxable income, if any, from the activities conducted through our taxable REIT subsidiaries. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The analysis below includes changes attributable to acquisitions, development activity, divestitures and the changes resulting from properties that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development properties prior to being stabilized (generally defined as 90% leased or 12 months after we receive a certificate of occupancy for the building). We refer to these properties as the same store properties. For the comparison between the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 68.0 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2002 consisted of 43 buildings, aggregating approximately 5.4 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2001 consisted of 65 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.8 million square feet. In 2002, property divestitures consisted of 58 industrial buildings and two retail centers, aggregating approximately 5.7 million square feet. In 2001, property divestitures consisted of 24 industrial and two retail buildings, aggregating approximately 3.2 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical rates. While occupancy levels in our industrial portfolio were similar in 2002 and 2001, rents on lease renewals and rollovers were lower in 2002 as the general contraction in business activity nationwide caused a reduction 23 in demand for industrial warehouse facilities. This reduction in demand was evidenced by two significant factors: decreases in national industrial occupancy levels and negative net absorption of industrial facility space. Specifically, according to Torto Wheaton Research, at December 31, 2001, national industrial occupancy was 90.2%; by December 31, 2002, national occupancy fell to 88.8%. As reported by Torto Wheaton Research, national net absorption of industrial space (the change in the amount of square footage leased in existing and newly constructed industrial properties) was positive from 1989 through 2000. By contrast, Torto Wheaton Research reported that net absorption was negative by 152.0 million square feet in 2001 and 34.0 million square feet in 2002. These factors combined to reduce market rents for industrial properties by approximately 15% to 20% nationally from peak levels at the beginning of 2001. While the level of rental rate reduction varied by market, we strove to maintain high occupancy by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions.

Industrial same store occupancy was 94.6% at December 31, 2002, and 95.0% at December 31, 2001. Year-to-date, the same store rent decrease on industrial renewals and rollovers (cash basis) was (1.4%) on 13.8 million square feet leased. The increase in straight-line rents was partially offset by write-offs associated with lease terminations. In 2002, lease termination fees increased $9.5 million, net of straight-line rent adjustments and lease cost and tenant improvement write-downs, over 2001.

We carried a 9.5% mortgage note secured by the retail center that we sold in September 2000 in the principal amount of $74.0 million. 24 Property Operating Expenses and Real Estate Taxes (Exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 2002 2001 $ Change % Change Rental expenses $ 77.5 $ 64.5 $ 13.0 20.2 % Real estate taxes 68.4 63.3 5.1 8.1 % Property operating expenses $ 145.9 $ 127.8 $ 18.1 14.2 % Industrial: Same store $ 118.3 $ 112.6 $ 5.7 5.1 % 2001 acquisitions 11.0 3.9 7.1 182.1 % 2002 acquisitions 6.8 — 6.8 — Developments 7.2 3.1 4.1 132.3 % Divestitures 6.7 10.0 (3.3 ) (33.0 )% Retail 6.3 8.6 (2.3 ) (26.7 )% Discontinued operations (10.4 ) (10.4 ) 0.0 — Total $ 145.9 $ 127.8 $ 18.1 14.2 % The $5.7 million increase in same store properties’ operating expenses primarily relates to increases in real estate taxes of $1.2 million and insurance expenses of $3.7 million due to premium increases.

The secured debt issuances were primarily for our co-investment joint ventures’ properties. The increase in depreciation expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the consolidation of AMB Investment Management, Inc. (predecessor-in-interest to AMB Capital Partners, LLC) and Headlands Realty Corporation on May 31, 2001. Prior to May 31, 2001, general and administrative expenses did not include expenses incurred by two unconsolidated preferred stock subsidiaries, Headlands Realty Corporation and AMB Investment Management, Inc. General and administrative expenses would have been $39.4 million had the subsidiaries been consolidated beginning January 1, 2001. The increase in general and administrative expenses was also due to increased stock-based compensation expense, additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international expansion and income taxes for our taxable REIT subsidiaries. In 2001, we recognized $20.8 million of losses on investments in other companies, including our investment in Webvan Group, Inc. and other technology-related companies. The loss reflects a 100% write-down of the investments. No gains or losses were recognized in 2002. 25 For the Years Ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 Rental Revenues 2001 2000 $ Change % Change (Dollars in millions) Same store $ 400.2 $ 376.7 $ 23.5 6.2 % 2000 acquisitions 97.1 25.6 71.5 279.3 % 2001 acquisitions 22.8 — 22.8 — Developments 26.9 14.6 12.3 84.0 % Divestitures 10.9 37.1 (26.2 ) (70.6 )% Discontinued operations (38.0 ) (33.1 ) (4.9 ) 14.8 % Straight-line rents 10.1 10.2 (0.1 ) (1.0 )% Total $ 530.0 $ 431.1 $ 98.9 22.9 % The growth in rental revenues in same store properties resulted primarily from the incremental effect of cash rental rate increases on renewals and rollovers, fixed rent increases on existing leases, and reimbursement of expenses, partially offset by lower average occupancies.

The secured debt issuances were primarily for our co-investment joint ventures’ properties. The increase in depreciation expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased personnel and occupancy costs. In addition, the consolidation of AMB Investment Management, Inc. (predecessor-in-interest to AMB Capital Partners, LLC) and Headlands Realty Corporation on May 31, 2001, resulted in an increase in general and administrative expenses of $4.9 million. During 2001, we recognized $20.8 million of losses on investments in other companies, related to our investment in Webvan Group, Inc. and other technology-related companies. The loss reflects a 100% write-down of the book value of the investments. 27 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: • cash flow from operations; • borrowings under our unsecured credit facility; • other forms of secured or unsecured financing; • proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries); • net proceeds from divestitures of properties; and • private capital from co-investment partners. We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facility and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. Capital Resources Property Divestitures. During 2002, we divested ourselves of 58 industrial buildings, two retail centers and an undeveloped retail land parcel for an aggregate price of $244.0 million, with a resulting net gain of $9.6 million. During 2002, we also completed and sold six buildings developed as part of our development-for-sale program for a net gain of $1.0 million. Properties Held for Divestiture. We have decided to divest ourselves of two retail centers, four industrial properties and two development properties, which are not in our core markets or which do not meet our current strategic objectives. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. As of December 31, 2002, the net carrying value of the properties held for divestiture was $107.9 million. Co-investment Joint Ventures. We consolidate the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of our five co-investment joint ventures. Our five co-investment joint ventures are engaged in the acquisition, ownership, operation, management and, in some cases, the renovation, expansion and development of industrial buildings in target markets nationwide. We consolidate these joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because we are the sole managing general partner and, as a result, control all major operating decisions. Third-party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2002, we owned approximately 28.2 million square feet of our properties through these five co-investment joint ventures and 5.6 million square feet of our properties through our other consolidated joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. During 2002, we sold $76.9 million in operating properties, consisting of 15 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 1.9 million square feet, to one of our co-investment joint ventures, AMB-SGP, L.P. We recognized a gain of $3.3 million related to this sale, representing the portion of the sold properties acquired by the third-party co-investor. We also sold 30% of our interest in AMB Partners II, L.P. to our co-investment joint venture partner, we now own 20% of AMB Partners II, L.P. We recognized a gain of $6.3 million related to this sale. 28 Our co-investment joint ventures at December 31, 2002 (dollars in thousands): Company’s Approximate Ownership Total Planned Co-investment Joint Venture Joint Venture Partner Percentage Capitalization(1) AMB/ Erie, L.P.

(5) In November 2002, our partner increased its ownership in AMB Partners II, L.P. from 50% to 80% by acquiring 30% of our partnership interest. We recognized a gain of $6.3 million. Equity. We have authorized for issuance 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which the following series were designated as of December 31, 2002: 4,600,000 shares of Series A preferred; 1,300,000 shares of Series B preferred; 1,595,337 shares of Series D preferred; 220,440 shares of Series E preferred; 267,439 shares of Series F preferred; 840,000 shares of Series H preferred; 510,000 shares of Series I preferred; 800,000 shares of Series J preferred; and 800,000 shares of Series K preferred. On July 31, 2002, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased 130,000 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 20,000 of its outstanding 7.95% Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units from a single institutional investor. We redeemed the units for an aggregate cost of $7.1 million, including accrued and unpaid dividends and a redemption discount of $0.4 million. On April 17, 2002, the operating partnership issued and sold 800,000 7.95% Series K Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a price of $50.00 per unit in a private placement. Distributions are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears. The Series K Preferred Units are redeemable by the operating partnership on or after April 17, 2007, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $50.00 per unit, plus accumulated and unpaid distributions thereon, if any, to the redemption date. The Series K Preferred Units are exchangeable at specified times and subject to certain conditions, on a one-for-one basis, for shares of our Series K Preferred Stock. The operating partnership used the net proceeds of $39.0 million for general corporate purposes, which included the partial repayment of indebtedness and the acquisition and development of additional properties. During 2002, we redeemed 122,640 common limited partnership units of the operating partnership for shares of our common stock. In December 2001, our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $100.0 million worth of our common and preferred stock. In December 2002, our board of directors increased the repurchase program to $200.0 million. The current stock repurchase program expires in December 2003 and as of December 31, 2002, $130.6 million of repurchase capacity remained under our current stock repurchase program. During 2002, we repurchased 2,651,600 shares of our common stock for $69.4 million, including commissions. In July 2002, we also repurchased 4,200 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock for an aggregate cost of $0.1 million, including accrued and unpaid dividends. 29 Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend to operate with a debt-to-total market capitalization ratio (our share) of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2002, our share of total debt-to-total market capitalization ratio was 37.7%. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. In spite of these policies, our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our board of directors could alter or eliminate these policies or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2002, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.3 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $9.8 million. Of the $1.3 billion of secured debt, $0.9 billion is secured by properties in our joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non-recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 3.0% to 10.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 7.3%) and final maturity dates ranging from January 2003 to June 2023. All of the secured debt bears interest at fixed rates, except for seven loans with an aggregate principal amount of $65.6 million as of December 31, 2002, which bear interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 3.5% as of December 31, 2002). Over time, we intend to repay the secured debt on our 100%-owned assets and may prepay if market conditions warrant. In May 2002, the operating partnership commenced a medium-term note program for the issuance of up to $400.0 million in principal amount of medium-term notes, which will be guaranteed by us. As of December 31, 2002, the operating partnership had issued no medium-term notes under this program. In August 2000, the operating partnership commenced a medium-term note program for the issuance of up to $400.0 million in principal amount of medium-term notes, which are guaranteed by us. On January 14, 2002, the operating partnership completed the program when it issued and sold the remaining $20.0 million of the notes to Lehman Brothers, Inc., as principal. We have guaranteed the notes, which mature on January 17, 2007, and bear interest at 5.90% per annum. The operating partnership used the net proceeds of $19.9 million for general corporate purposes, to partially repay indebtedness and to acquire and develop additional properties. We guarantee the operating partnership’s obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. In December 2002, the operating partnership renewed its $500.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit. We guarantee the operating partnership’s obligations under the credit facility. The credit facility matures in December 2005, has a one-year extension option and is currently subject to a 20 basis point annual facility fee. Borrowings under our credit facility currently bear interest at LIBOR plus 60 basis points. Both the facility fee and the interest rate are based on our credit rating, which is currently investment grade. However, if our credit rating falls below investment grade, then our facility fee and interest rate may increase. The credit facility includes a multi-currency component under which up to $150.0 million may be drawn in either British pounds sterling, euros or yen, provided that such currency is readily available and freely transferable and convertible to U.S. dollars. The Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service reports LIBOR for such currency in interest periods of 1, 2, 3 or 6 months. The operating partnership has the ability to increase available borrowings to $700.0 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments. We use our unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions and for general working capital requirements. Monthly debt service payments on our credit facility are interest only. The total amount available under our credit facility fluctuates based upon the borrowing base, as defined in the agreement governing the credit facility, generally the value of our unencumbered properties. As of December 31, 2002, the outstanding balance on our unsecured credit facility was $95.0 million and the 30 remaining amount available was $379.0 million, net of outstanding letters of credit (excluding the $200.0 million of potential additional capacity). In July 2001, AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P. obtained a $150.0 million credit facility secured by the unfunded capital commitments of the investors in AMB Institutional Alliance REIT II, Inc. and AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P. Borrowings currently bear interest at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points. As of December 31, 2002, the outstanding balance was $45.5 million and the remaining amount available was $31.2 million, net of outstanding letters of credit and capital contributions from third-party investors. Mortgage Receivables. In September 2000, we sold a retail center located in Southern California. We carried a 9.5% mortgage note secured by the retail center in the principal amount of $74.0 million, due September 30, 2002. On July 3, 2002, we received a full repayment of the mortgage. Through a wholly-owned subsidiary, we also hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2002, the outstanding balance on the note was $13.1 million. 31 The tables below summarize our debt maturities and capitalization as of December 31, 2002 (dollars in thousands): DEBT Company Joint Unsecured Secured Venture Senior Debt Unsecured Credit Debt Debt Securities Debt Facilities Total Debt 2003 $ 74,631 $ 19,678 $ — $ 558 $ 45,500 $ 140,367 2004 63,465 64,928 — 601 — 128,994 2005 45,511 59,326 250,000 647 95,000 450,484 2006 85,023 65,676 25,000 698 — 176,397 2007 24,073 43,163 75,000 752 — 142,988 2008 32,669 154,684 175,000 810 — 363,163 2009 4,147 76,826 — 873 — 81,846 2010 50,948 105,854 75,000 941 — 232,743 2011 409 179,295 75,000 1,014 — 255,718 2012 407 101,399 — 1,092 — 102,898 Thereafter 481 22,264 125,000 2,200 — 149,945 Subtotal 381,764 893,093 800,000 10,186 140,500 2,225,543 Unamortized premiums 7,835 1,983 — — — 9,818 Total consolidated debt 389,599 895,076 800,000 10,186 140,500 2,235,361 Our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt(1) — 39,288 — — — 39,288 Total debt 389,599 934,364 800,000 10,186 140,500 2,274,649 Joint venture partners’ share of consolidated joint venture debt — (546,509 ) — — (36,400 ) (582,909 ) Our share of total debt $ 389,599 $ 387,855 $ 800,000 $ 10,186 $ 104,100 $ 1,691,740 Weighed average interest rate 8.1 % 7.0 % 7.2 % 7.5 % 2.1 % 7.0 % Weighed average maturity (in years) 3.7 7.1 6.5 11.8 2.2 6.0 (1) The weighted average interest and maturity for the unconsolidated joint venture debt were 6.4% and 6.6 years, respectively. 32 MARKET EQUITY Shares/Units Security Outstanding Market Price Market Value Common stock 82,029,449 $ 27.36 $ 2,244,326 Common limited partnership units 4,846,387 27.36 132,597 Total 86,875,836 $ 2,376,923 PREFERRED STOCK AND UNITS Dividend Liquidation Redemption Security Rate Preference Provisions Series A preferred stock 8.50 % $ 99,895 July 2003 Series B preferred units 8.63 % 65,000 November 2003 Series D preferred units 7.75 % 79,767 May 2004 Series E preferred units 7.75 % 11,022 August 2004 Series F preferred units 7.95 % 13,372 March 2005 Series H preferred units 8.13 % 42,000 September 2005 Series I preferred units 8.00 % 25,500 March 2006 Series J preferred units 7.95 % 40,000 September 2006 Series K preferred units 7.95 % 40,000 April 2007 Weighted average/total 8.17 % $ 416,556 CAPITALIZATION RATIOS Total debt-to-total market capitalization 44.9 % Our share of total debt-to-total market capitalization 37.7 % Total debt plus preferred-to-total market capitalization 53.1 % Our share of total debt plus preferred-to-total market capitalization 47.0 % Our share of total debt-to-total book capitalization 45.9 % Liquidity As of December 31, 2002, we had $117.2 million in cash, restricted cash and cash equivalents, and $379.0 million of additional available borrowings under our credit facility. We also had $31.2 million of additional available borrowings under our AMB Institutional Alliance Fund II, L.P. credit facility. To fund acquisitions, development activities and capital expenditures, and to provide for general working capital requirements, we intend to use: • cash flow from operations; • borrowings under our unsecured credit facility; • other forms of secured and unsecured financing; • proceeds from any future debt or equity offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries); • net proceeds from divestitures of properties; and • private capital from our co-investment partners. The unavailability of capital would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. 33 Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ending December 31, 2002, of $0.41 per share of common stock and the operating partnership declared a regular cash distribution for the quarter ending December 31, 2002, of $0.41 per common unit.

The following table sets forth the dividends and distributions paid or payable per share or unit for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000: Paying Entity Security 2002 2001 2000 AMB Property Corporation Common stock $ 1.64 $ 1.58 $ 1.48 AMB Property Corporation Series A preferred stock $ 2.13 $ 2.13 $ 2.13 Operating Partnership Common limited partnership units $ 1.64 $ 1.58 $ 1.48 Operating Partnership Series A preferred units $ 2.13 $ 2.13 $ 2.13 Operating Partnership Series B preferred units $ 4.31 $ 4.31 $ 4.31 Operating Partnership Series J preferred units $ 3.98 $ 1.24 n/a Operating Partnership Series K preferred units $ 2.96 n/a n/a AMB Property II, L.P. Series C preferred units n/a $ 3.88 $ 4.38 AMB Property II, L.P. Series D preferred units $ 3.88 $ 3.88 $ 3.88 AMB Property II, L.P. Series E preferred units $ 3.88 $ 3.88 $ 3.88 AMB Property II, L.P. Series F preferred units(1) $ 3.34 $ 3.98 $ 3.09 AMB Property II, L.P.

Series I preferred units $ 4.00 $ 3.04 n/a (1) On July 31, 2002, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, repurchased 130,000 of its 7.95% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units and all 20,000 of its outstanding 7.95% Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units from a single institutional investor. On July, 31, 2002, AMB Property II, L.P. paid a distribution, which accrued during the period from July 15, 2002 to July 31, 2002, of $0.155 per unit on the 130,000 Series F preferred units that were redeemed. The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Commitments Developments. In addition to recurring capital expenditures, which consist of building improvements and leasing costs incurred to renew or re-tenant space, as of December 31, 2002, we are developing ten projects representing a total estimated investment of $106.8 million upon completion and three development projects available for sale representing a total estimated investment of $49.1 million upon completion. Of this total, $92.8 million had been funded as of December 31, 2002, and an estimated $63.1 million is required to complete current and planned projects. We expect to fund these expenditures with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facility, debt or equity issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. Acquisitions. During 2002, we invested $403.3 million in 43 operating industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 5.4 million rentable square feet, and a parking lot adjacent to Los Angeles International 34 Airport. We funded these acquisitions and initiated development and renovation projects through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facility, cash, debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on-tarmac facilities, and office space with remaining lease terms from one to 38 years. Future minimum rental payments required under non-cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2002, were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2003 $ 19,921 2004 19,753 2005 19,819 2006 20,553 2007 20,772 Thereafter 283,574 Total lease commitments $ 384,392 These operating lease payments are being amortized ratably over the terms of the related leases. Captive Insurance Company. We have responded to recent trends towards increasing costs and decreasing coverage availability in the insurance markets by obtaining higher-deductible property insurance from third-party insurers and by forming a wholly-owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., in December 2001. Arcata National Insurance Ltd. provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the increased deductible under the third-party policies. We capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in accordance with regulatory requirements. Arcata National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. have a retrospective component, so that if expenses, including losses, are less than premiums collected, the excess will be returned to the property owners (and, in turn, as appropriate, to the customers) and conversely, subject to certain limitations, if expenses, including losses, are greater than premiums collected, an additional premium will be charged. As with all recoverable expenses, differences between estimated and actual insurance premiums will be recognized in the subsequent year. Through this structure, we believe that we have been able to obtain insurance for our portfolio with more comprehensive coverage at a projected overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Unknown Liabilities. Unknown liabilities may include the following: • liabilities for clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; • claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation transactions; • accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; • tax liabilities; and • claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. 35 Overview of Contractual Obligations The following tables summarizes our debt and lease commitments as of December 31, 2002 (dollars in thousands): Less than More than 5 Contractual Obligations 1 Year 1–3 Years 3–5 Years Years Total Debt $ 140,367 $ 579,478 $ 319,385 $ 1,186,313 $ 2,225,543 Lease commitments 19,921 39,572 41,325 283,574 384,392 Total contractual obligations $ 160,288 $ 619,050 $ 360,710 $ 1,469,887 $ 2,609,935 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have no off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations, guarantees or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Supplemental Earning Measure We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP , is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, the real estate industry has adopted a supplemental earnings measure, funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), that is widely used by investors and analysts. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance. Further, FFO as disclosed by other real estate investment trusts may not be comparable. FFO is defined as income from operations before minority interest plus real estate depreciation, discontinued operations’ FFO and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures, less minority interests’ pro rata share of FFO of consolidated joint ventures and perpetual preferred stock dividends. In accordance with the NAREIT White Paper on FFO, we include the effects of straight-line rents in FFO. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non-recurring charges. 36 The following table reflects the calculation of FFO for the years ended December 31, (dollars in thousands): 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 Net income $ 116,153 $ 125,053 $ 113,282 $ 167,603 $ 108,954 Minority interests 37,806 34,835 20,323 14,486 9,350 Gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests (7,789 ) (23,259 ) (1,144 ) (51,263 ) — Gains from dispositions of real estate, discontinued operations (11,372 ) — — — — Preferred unit redemption discount/(premium) (412 ) 4,400 — — — Real estate related depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 127,160 104,838 84,960 63,747 55,210 Discontinued operations’ depreciation 7,529 6,600 5,398 3,758 2,254 Furniture, fixtures and equipment depreciation and ground lease amortization(1) (2,450 ) (1,963 ) (1,114 ) (1,002 ) (463 ) FFO attributable to minority interests (52,051 ) (40,144 ) (15,030 ) (8,158 ) (5,887 ) Adjustments to derive FFO in unconsolidated joint ventures: Our share of net income (5,674 ) (5,467 ) (5,212 ) (4,701 ) (1,750 ) Our share of FFO 8,728 8,014 7,188 6,677 2,739 Funds from operations $ 217,628 $ 212,907 $ 208,651 $ 191,147 $ 170,407 (1) Ground lease amortization represents the amortization of our investments in ground lease properties, for which we do not have a purchase option.

These risks include, among others: General Real Estate Risks There are Factors Outside of Our Control that Affect the Performance and Value of Our Properties. Real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk. The yields available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated by the related properties as well as the expenses incurred in connection with the properties. If our properties do not generate income sufficient to meet operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, then our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders could be adversely affected. Income from, and the value of, our properties may be adversely affected by the general economic climate, local conditions, such as oversupply of industrial space or a reduction in demand for industrial space, the attractiveness of our properties to potential customers, competition from other properties, our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance and an increase in operating costs. Periods of economic slowdown or recession in the United States and in other countries, rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate, or public perception that any of these events may occur, would result in a general decrease in rents or an increased occurrence of defaults under existing leases, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our properties are currently concentrated predominantly in the industrial real estate sector. Our concentration in a certain property type exposes us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our portfolio also included other property types. As a result of such concentration, economic downturns in the industrial real estate sector could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, revenues from properties and real estate values are also affected by factors such as the cost of compliance with regulations, the potential for liability under applicable laws (including changes in tax laws), interest rate levels and the availability of financing. Our income would be adversely affected if a significant number of customers were unable to pay rent or if we were unable to rent our industrial space on favorable terms. Certain significant expenditures associated with an investment in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes, and maintenance costs) generally do not decline when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property. Future terrorist attacks in the United States may result in declining economic activity, which could harm the demand for and the value of our properties. To the extent that our customers are impacted by future attacks, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to honor their existing leases. We May Be Unable to Renew Leases or Relet Space as Leases Expire. We are subject to the risks that leases may not be renewed, space may not be relet, or the terms of renewal or reletting (including the cost of required renovations) may be less favorable than current lease terms. Leases on a total of 15.4% of our industrial properties (based on annualized base rent) as of December 31, 2002, will expire on or prior to December 31, 2003. In addition, numerous properties compete with our properties in attracting customers to lease space, particularly with respect to retail centers. The number of competitive commercial properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space in our properties and on the rents that we are able to charge. Our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected if we are unable to promptly relet or renew the leases for all or a substantial portion of expiring leases, if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting is significantly lower than expected, or if our reserves for these purposes prove inadequate. Real Estate Investments are Illiquid. Because real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions is limited. The limitations in the Internal Revenue Code and related 38 regulations on a real estate investment trust holding property for sale may affect our ability to sell properties without adversely affecting dividends to our stockholders. The relative illiquidity of our holdings and Internal Revenue Code prohibitions and related regulations could impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. A Significant Number of Our Properties are Located in California. Our industrial properties located in California as of December 31, 2002, represented 28.4% of the aggregate square footage of our industrial operating properties as of December 31, 2002, and 33.9% of our industrial annualized base rent. Annualized base rent means the monthly contractual amount under existing leases as of December 31, 2002, multiplied by 12. This amount excludes expense reimbursements and rental abatements. Our revenue from, and the value of, our properties located in California may be affected by a number of factors, including local real estate conditions (such as oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties) and the local economic climate. Business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics, and other factors may adversely impact the local economic climate. A downturn in California’s economy, fiscal situation or real estate conditions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Certain of our properties are also subject to possible loss from seismic activity. See “Some Potential Losses are not Covered by Insurance.” Some Potential Losses are not Covered by Insurance. We carry commercial liability, property and rental loss insurance covering all properties owned and managed by us, with policy specifications and insured limits that we believe are adequate and appropriate under the circumstances given relative risks, the cost of such coverage and industry practice. Certain losses such as losses due to terrorism, windstorms, floods or seismic activity may be insured subject to certain limitations, including large deductibles or co-payments and policy limits. Although we have obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism, with policy specifications and insured limits that we believe are commercially reasonable, it is not certain that we will be able to renew coverage or collect under such policies. From time to time, we evaluate the amount of earthquake coverage that we carry for all properties owned and managed by us, to assess whether, in our good faith discretion, the coverage is adequate. We may incur material losses in excess of insurance proceeds and we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, there are certain losses that are not generally insured because it is not economically feasible to insure against them, including losses due to riots or acts of war. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, then we could lose the capital we invested in the properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the properties and, in the case of debt, which is with recourse to us, we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties. Moreover, as the general partner of the operating partnership, we generally will be liable for all of the operating partnership’s unsatisfied obligations other than non-recourse obligations, including any obligations incurred by the operating partnership as the general partner of the co-investment joint ventures. Any such liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. A number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity, including California where, as of December 31, 2002, 295 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 23.9 million square feet (representing 28.4% of our industrial operating properties based on aggregate square footage and 33.9% based on industrial annualized base rent), are located. We carry replacement-cost earthquake insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. This insurance coverage also applies to the properties managed by AMB Capital Partners, LLC, with a single aggregate policy limit and deductible applicable to those properties and our properties. Through an annual analysis prepared by outside consultants, we evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage in light of current industry practice and determine the appropriate amount of earthquake insurance to carry, which we believe is commercially 39 reasonable. We may incur material losses in excess of insurance proceeds and we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance at commercially reasonable rates. We are Subject to Risks and Liabilities In Connection With Properties Owned Through Joint Ventures, Limited Liability Companies and Partnerships. As of December 31, 2002, we had ownership interests in several joint ventures, limited liability companies or partnerships with third parties, as well as interests in three unconsolidated entities. As of December 31, 2002, we owned approximately 33.7 million square feet (excluding three unconsolidated joint ventures) of our properties through these entities. We may make additional investments through these ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. Such partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions. Partnership, limited liability company or joint venture investments may involve risks such as the following: • our partners, co-members or joint venturers might become bankrupt (in which event we and any other remaining general partners, members, or joint venturers would generally remain liable for the liabilities of the partnership, limited liability company, or joint venture); • our partners, co-members or joint venturers might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals; • our partners, co-members or joint venturers may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions, requests, policies, or objectives, including our current policy with respect to maintaining our qualification as a real estate investment trust; and • agreements governing joint ventures, limited liability companies and partnerships often contain restrictions on the transfer of a joint venturer’s, member’s or partner’s interest or “buy-sell” or other provisions that may result in a purchase or sale of the interest at a disadvantageous time or on disadvantageous terms. We will, however, generally seek to maintain sufficient control of our partnerships, limited liability companies, and joint ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in partnerships, limited liability companies or joint ventures. The occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We May be Unable to Consummate Acquisitions on Advantageous Terms or Acquisitions May Not Perform As We Expect. We intend to continue to acquire primarily industrial properties. The acquisition of and investment in properties entails various risks. In addition to the general investment risks associated with any real estate investment, our investments may not perform in accordance with our expectations or our cost estimates for bringing an acquired property up to market standards may prove inaccurate. Further, we may not be able to acquire additional properties on acceptable terms. We anticipate significant competition for attractive investment opportunities from other major real estate investors with significant capital including both publicly-traded real estate investment trusts and private institutional investment funds. In addition, we expect to finance future acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units by the operating partnership or its subsidiaries) and proceeds from property divestitures, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. Our inability to finance future acquisitions on favorable terms, the failure of acquisitions to conform with our expectations or investment criteria, or our failure to timely reinvest the proceeds from property divestitures could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. 40 We May be Unable to Complete Divestitures on Advantageous Terms. We have decided to divest ourselves of retail centers and industrial properties that are not in our core markets or which do not meet our strategic objectives. The divestitures of the properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. Our ability to dispose of properties on advantageous terms is dependent upon factors beyond our control, including competition from other owners (including other real estate investment trusts) that are attempting to dispose of industrial and retail properties and the availability of attractive financing for potential buyers of our properties. Our inability to dispose of properties on favorable terms or redeploy the proceeds of property divestitures in accordance with our investment strategy could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We May be Unable to Complete Renovation and Development Projects on Advantageous Terms. The real estate development business, including the renovation and rehabilitation of existing properties, involves significant risks that include the following: • we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms for development projects and we may not complete construction on schedule or within budget, resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs and delays in leasing such properties and generating cash flow; • we may not be able to obtain, or we may experience delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations; • new or renovated properties may perform below anticipated levels, producing cash flow below budgeted amounts; • substantial renovation as well as new development activities, regardless of their ultimate success, typically require a substantial portion of management’s time and attention, diverting our attention from our day-to-day operations; and • upon completion of construction, we may not be able to obtain permanent financing, or obtain permanent financing on advantageous terms, for activities that we have financed through construction loans. These risks could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Debt Financing We Could Incur More Debt. It is our policy to incur debt, either directly or through our subsidiaries, only if it will not cause our share of debt-to-total market capitalization ratio to exceed approximately 45%. The aggregate amount of indebtedness that we may incur under our policy varies directly with the valuation of our capital stock and the number of shares of capital stock outstanding. Accordingly, we would be able to incur additional indebtedness under our policy as a result of increases in the market price per share of our common stock or other outstanding classes of capital stock, and future issuance of shares of our capital stock. However, our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our board of directors could alter or eliminate this policy. If we change this policy, then we could become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Scheduled Debt Payments Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition. We are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including that cash flow will be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders, that we will be unable to refinance existing indebtedness on our properties (which in all cases will not have been fully amortized at maturity), and that the terms of 41 refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. As of December 31, 2002, we had total debt outstanding of $2.2 billion. In addition, we guarantee the operating partnership’s obligations with respect to the senior debt securities referenced in our financial statements. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions, then we expect that our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay all such maturing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, if we mortgage one or more of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, then the property could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value. A foreclosure on one or more of our properties could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Rising Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect Our Cash Flow. As of December 31, 2002, we had $45.5 million outstanding under our Alliance Fund II secured credit facility, $95.0 million outstanding on our unsecured credit facility, and we had seven secured loans with an aggregate principal amount of $65.6 million that bear interest at variable rates (with weighted average interest rate of 3.5% as of December 31, 2002). In addition, we may incur other variable rate indebtedness in the future. Increases in interest rates on this indebtedness could increase our interest expense, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Accordingly, in the future, we may engage in transactions to limit our exposure to rising interest rates. We Are Dependent on External Sources of Capital. In order to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain) and we are subject to tax on our income to the extent it is not distributed. Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs, including capital needs in connection with acquisitions, from cash retained from operations. As a result, to fund capital needs we rely on third-party sources of capital, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms or at all. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors, including: • general market conditions; • the market’s perception of our growth potential; • our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and • the market price of our capital stock. Additional debt financing may substantially increase our debt-to-total capitalization ratio. We Could Default on Cross-Collateralized and Cross-Defaulted Debt. As of December 31, 2002, we had 26 non-recourse secured loans that are cross-collateralized by 60 properties, totaling $711.7 million (not including unamortized debt premium). If we default on any of these loans, then we could be required to repay the aggregate of all indebtedness, together with applicable prepayment charges, to avoid foreclosure on all the cross-collateralized properties within the applicable pool. Foreclosure on our properties, or our inability to refinance our loans on favorable terms, could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, our credit facilities and senior debt securities contain certain cross-default 42 provisions, which are triggered in the event that our other material indebtedness is in default. These cross-default provisions may require us to repay or restructure the credit facilities and the senior debt securities in addition to any mortgage or other debt that is in default, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Contingent or Unknown Liabilities Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition. Our predecessors have been in existence for varying lengths of time up to 19 years. At the time of our formation we acquired the assets of these entities subject to all of their potential existing liabilities. There may be current liabilities or future liabilities arising from prior activities that we are not aware of and therefore have not disclosed in this report. We assumed these liabilities as the surviving entity in the various merger and contribution transactions that occurred at the time of our formation. Existing liabilities for indebtedness generally were taken into account in connection with the allocation of the operating partnership’s limited partnership units or shares of our common stock in the formation transactions, but no other liabilities were taken into account for these purposes. We do not have recourse against our predecessors or any of their respective stockholders or partners or against any individual account investors with respect to any unknown liabilities. Unknown liabilities might include the following: • liabilities for clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; • claims of customers, vendors, or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to the formation transactions that had not been asserted prior to the formation transactions; • accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; • tax liabilities; and • claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. Certain customers may claim that the formation transactions gave rise to a right to purchase the premises that they occupy. We do not believe any such claims would be material and, to date, no such claims have been filed. See “— Government Regulations — We Could Encounter Costly Environmental Problems” below regarding the possibility of undisclosed environmental conditions potentially affecting the value of our properties. Undisclosed material liabilities in connection with the acquisition of properties, entities and interests in properties, or entities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Conflicts of Interest Some of Our Directors and Executive Officers are Involved in Other Real Estate Activities and Investments. Some of our executive officers own interests in real estate-related businesses and investments. These interests include minority ownership interests in Institutional Housing Partners, L.P., a residential housing finance company (Messrs. Burke and Moghadam) and Aspire Development, Inc. and Aspire Development, L.P., developers of properties not within our investment criteria (Messrs. Belmonte, Burke and Moghadam). The continued involvement in other real estate-related activities by some of our executive officers and directors could divert management’s attention from our day-to-day operations. Our executive officers have entered into non-competition agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed not to engage in any activities, directly or indirectly, in respect of commercial real estate, and not to make any investment in respect of any industrial or retail real estate, other than through ownership of not more than 5% of the outstanding shares of a public company engaged in such activities or through the existing investments referred to in this report. State law may limit our ability to enforce these agreements. 43 Certain of Our Executive Officers and Directors May Have Conflicts of Interest with Us in Connection with Other Properties that They Own or Control. As of December 31, 2002, Aspire Development, L.P. owned interests in several retail development projects in the U.S., which are individually less than 10,000 feet. In addition, Messrs. Moghadam and Burke, each a founder and director, own less than 1% interests in two partnerships that own office buildings in various markets; these interests have negligible value. Luis A. Belmonte, an executive officer, owns less than a 10% interest, representing an estimated value of $150,000, in a limited partnership, which owns an office building located in Oakland, California. In addition, several of our executive officers individually own: • less than 1% interests in the stocks of certain publicly-traded real estate investment trusts; • certain interests in and rights to developed and undeveloped real property located outside the United States; and • certain other de minimus holdings in equity securities of real estate companies. Thomas W. Tusher, a member of our board of directors and chair of the board’s compensation committee, is a limited partner in a venture in which Messrs. Moghadam and Burke are two of three members in the controlling general partner. The venture owns an office building. Mr. Tusher owns a 20% interest in the venture and Messrs. Moghadam and Burke each have a 26.7% interest in the venture. These interests in the venture have negligible value. The venture was formed in 1985, prior to the time of our initial public offering, and we continue to act as property and asset manager of the office building, for which services the venture pays us a fee. In our capacity as property and asset manager, we oversee the management and operation of the property, including the obtaining of financing and negotiating with third party lenders in connection therewith. The largest tenant, which occupies 68% of the building, filed for bankruptcy in January 2003. We believe that the properties and activities set forth above generally do not directly compete with any of our properties. However, it is possible that a property in which an executive officer or director, or an affiliate of an executive officer or director, has an interest may compete with us in the future if we were to invest in a property similar in type and in close proximity to that property. In addition, the continued involvement by our executive officers and directors in these properties could divert management’s attention from our day-to-day operations. Our policy prohibits us from acquiring any properties from our executive officers or their affiliates without the approval of the disinterested members of our board of directors with respect to that transaction. Our Role as General Partner of the Operating Partnership May Conflict with the Interests of Stockholders. As the general partner of the operating partnership, we have fiduciary obligations to the operating partnership’s limited partners, the discharge of which may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, those persons holding limited partnership units will have the right to vote as a class on certain amendments to the partnership agreement of the operating partnership and individually to approve certain amendments that would adversely affect their rights. The limited partners may exercise these voting rights in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, under the terms of the operating partnership’s partnership agreement, holders of limited partnership units will have certain approval rights with respect to certain transactions that affect all stockholders but which they may not exercise in a manner that reflects the interests of all stockholders. Our Directors, Executive Officers, and Significant Stockholders Could Act in a Manner that is Not in the Best Interest of All Stockholders. As of December 31, 2002, our two largest stockholders, Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Inc. (with respect to various client accounts for which Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Inc. serves as investment advisor) and ABP Investments U.S. (with respect to various client accounts for which ABP Investments U.S. serves as investment advisor) together beneficially owned 10.8% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, our executive officers and directors beneficially owned 4.3% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2002, and will have influence on our management and operation and, as 44 stockholders, will have influence on the outcome of any matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. This influence might be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other stockholders. Although there is no understanding or arrangement for these directors, officers, and stockholders and their affiliates to act in concert, these parties would be in a position to exercise significant influence over our affairs if they choose to do so. Government Regulations Many laws and governmental regulations are applicable to our properties and changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and the courts, occur frequently. We May Incur Costs to Comply with Americans with Disabilities Act. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act might require us to remove structural barriers to handicapped access in certain public areas where such removal is “readily achievable.” If we fail to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, then we might be required to pay fines to the government or damages to private litigants. The impact of application of the Americans with Disabilities Act to our properties, including the extent and timing of required renovations, is uncertain. If we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, then our cash flow and the amounts available for dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected. We Could Encounter Environmental Problems. Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment impose liability on a current or previous owner or operator of real estate for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at the property. A current or previous owner may be required to investigate and clean up contamination at or migrating from a site. These laws typically impose liability and clean-up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury, property damage, or other costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from environmental contamination present at or emanating from that site. Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos. These laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failing to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers. Some of our properties may contain asbestos-containing building materials. Some of our properties are leased or have been leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use, store, or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. These operations create a potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. Some of our properties are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain of our properties are on, are adjacent to, or are near other properties upon which others, including former owners or customers of the properties, have engaged or may in the future engage in activities that may release petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. From time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and the acquisition will yield a superior risk-adjusted return. Environmental issues for each 45 property are evaluated and quantified prior to acquisition. The costs of environmental investigation, clean-up and monitoring are underwritten into the cost of the acquisition and appropriate environmental insurance is obtained for the property. In connection with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties. All of our properties were subject to a Phase I or similar environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants at the time of acquisition. Phase I assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties and include an historical review, a public records review, an investigation of the surveyed site and surrounding properties, and preparation and issuance of a written report. We may perform additional Phase II testing if recommended by the independent environmental consultant. Phase II testing may include the collection and laboratory analysis of soil and groundwater samples, completion of surveys for asbestos-containing building materials, and any other testing that the consultant considers prudent in order to test for the presence of hazardous materials. None of the environmental assessments of our properties has revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. Furthermore, we are not aware of any such material environmental liability. Nonetheless, it is possible that the assessments do not reveal all environmental liabilities and that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware or that known environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are materially greater than anticipated. Moreover, the current environmental condition of our properties may be affected by customers, the condition of land, operations in the vicinity of the properties (such as releases from underground storage tanks), or by third-parties unrelated to us. If the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations exceed our budgets for these items, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. Our Financial Condition Could be Adversely Affected if We Fail to Comply with Other Regulations. Our properties are also subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements such as state and local fire and life-safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, then we might incur fines by governmental authorities or be required to pay awards of damages to private litigants. We believe that our properties are currently in substantial compliance with all such regulatory requirements. However, these requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us. Any such unanticipated expenditure could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Federal Income Tax Risks Our Failure to Qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust Would Have Serious Adverse Consequences to Our Stockholders. We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. Qualification as a real estate investment trust requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we must derive at least 95% of our gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our real estate investment 46 trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. These provisions and the applicable treasury regulations are more complicated in our case because we hold our assets through the operating partnership. Legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. However, we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to operate as a real estate investment trust. If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost qualification. If we lose our real estate investment trust status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved. In addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. We Pay Some Taxes. Even if we qualify as a real estate investment trust, we will be required to pay certain state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property. In addition, we will be required to pay federal and state income tax on the net taxable income, if any, from the activities conducted through our taxable REIT subsidiaries, IMD Holding Corporation and Headlands Realty Corporation, thereby reducing their cash available for distribution to us. Certain Property Transfers May Generate Prohibited Transaction Income. From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. Under the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction. We would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on that income. Since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we believe that any transfer or disposal of property by us would not be deemed by the Internal Revenue Service to be a prohibited transaction with any resulting gain allocable to us being subject to a 100% penalty tax. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. While we believe that the Internal Revenue Service would not prevail in any such dispute, if the IRS were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, any income from a prohibited transaction may adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes. We May Be Unable to Manage Our Growth. Our business has grown rapidly and continues to grow through property acquisitions and developments. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. Our International Growth is Subject to Special Political and Monetary Risks. We have and expect to continue to acquire or develop additional properties in foreign countries. Local markets affect our operations and, therefore, we would be subject to economic fluctuations in foreign locations. Our international operations also would be subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as the revaluation of currencies, revisions in tax treaties or other laws governing the taxation of revenues, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and, in certain parts of the world, property rights uncertainty and political instability. We cannot predict the likelihood that any such developments may occur. Further, we may enter into 47 agreements with non-U.S. entities that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute resolution in, the courts of another country or region. We cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide us with an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that may arise. Even if we are able to obtain a satisfactory decision through arbitration or a court proceeding, we could have difficulty enforcing any award or judgment on a timely basis. Our business has grown rapidly and continues to grow through property acquisitions and developments. If we fail to effectively manage our international growth, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. We Are Dependent On Our Key Personnel. We depend on the efforts of our executive officers. While we believe that we could find suitable replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers. Ownership of Our Stock Limitations in Our Charter and Bylaws Could Prevent a Change in Control. Certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay, defer, or prevent a change in control or other transaction that could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for the common stock. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year after the first taxable year for which a real estate investment trust election is made. Furthermore, our common stock must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a 12-month taxable year (or a proportionate part of a short tax year). In addition, if we, or an owner of 10% or more of our stock, actually or constructively owns 10% or more of one of our customers (or a tenant of any partnership in which we are a partner), then the rent received by us (either directly or through any such partnership) from that tenant will not be qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment trust gross income tests of the Internal Revenue Code. To facilitate maintenance of our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, we prohibit the ownership, actually or by virtue of the constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, by any single person of more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock and more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of our Series A preferred stock, and we also prohibit the ownership, actually or constructively, of any shares of our other preferred stock by any single person so that no such person, taking into account all of our stock so owned by such person, may own in excess of 9.8% of our issued and outstanding capital stock. We refer to this limitation as the “ownership limit.” Shares acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary. Any person who acquires shares in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the amount realized from the sale. A transfer of shares in violation of the above limits may be void under certain circumstances. The ownership limit may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control and, therefore, could adversely affect our stockholders’ ability to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for the shares of our common stock in connection with such transaction. Our charter authorizes us to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock and to establish the preferences, rights and other terms of any series or class of preferred stock that we issue. Although our board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series or class of preferred stock that could delay, defer, or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. 48 Our charter and bylaws and Maryland law also contain other provisions that may delay, defer, or prevent a transaction, including a change in control, that might involve payment of a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. Those provisions include the following: • directors may be removed only for cause and only upon a two-thirds vote of stockholders, together with bylaw provisions authorizing the board of directors to fill vacant directorships; • a two-thirds vote of stockholders for any amendment of the charter is required; • the request of the holders of 50% or more of our common stock is necessary for stockholders to call a special meeting; • stockholders may only take action by written consent with the unanimous approval of all stockholders entitled to vote on the matter in question; and • advance notice by stockholders for the nomination of directors or proposal of business to be considered at a meeting of stockholders is required. These provisions may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of our board of directors, which in turn may delay, defer or prevent a transaction involving a change of control. Various Market Conditions Affect the Price of Our Stock. As with other publicly-traded equity securities, the market price of our stock will depend upon various market conditions that may change from time to time. Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our stock are the following: • the extent of investor interest in us; • the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate-based companies); • our financial performance; • general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; and • terrorist activity may adversely affect the markets in which our securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending. Other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws could also have a significant impact on the future market price of our stock. Earnings and Cash Dividends, Asset Value and Market Interest Rates Affect the Price of Our Stock. The market value of the equity securities of a real estate investment trust generally is based primarily upon the market’s perception of the real estate investment trust’s growth potential and its current and potential future earnings and cash dividends. It is based secondarily upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets. For that reason, shares of our stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share. To the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves, or other purposes, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not correspondingly increase the market price of our stock. Our failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of our stock. Another factor that may influence the price of our stock will be the distribution yield on the stock (as a percentage of the price of the stock) relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates might lead prospective purchasers of our stock to expect a higher distribution yield, which would adversely affect the market price of the stock. If the market price of our stock declines significantly, then we might 49 breach certain covenants with respect to debt obligations, which might adversely affect our liquidity and ability to make future acquisitions and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. If We Issue Additional Securities, then the Investment of Existing Stockholders Will Be Diluted. We have authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities in exchange for property or otherwise. Similarly, we may cause the operating partnership to issue additional limited partnership units in exchange for property or otherwise. Existing stockholders will have no preemptive right to acquire any additional securities issued by us or the operating partnership and any issuance of additional equity securities could result in dilution of an existing stockholder’s investment. We Could Change Our Investment and Financing Policies without a Vote of Stockholders. Subject to our current investment policy to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust (unless a change is approved by our board of directors under certain circumstances), our board of directors will determine our investment and financing policies, our growth strategy and our debt, capitalization, distribution and operating policies. Although the board of directors has no present intention to revise or amend these strategies and policies, they may do so at any time without a vote of stockholders. Accordingly, stockholders will have no control over changes in our strategies and policies (other than through the election of directors), and any such changes may not serve the interests of all stockholders and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, including our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. Shares Available for Future Sale Could Adversely Affect the Market Price of Our Common Stock. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of our common stock, or the availability of shares of our common stock for future sale, will have on its market price. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market (or upon exchange of limited partnership units in the operating partnership) or the perception that such sales (or exchanges) might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. All shares of common stock issuable upon the redemption of limited partnership units in the operating partnership will be deemed to be “restricted securities” within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act and may not be transferred unless registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration is available, including any exemption from registration provided under Rule 144. In general, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, Rule 144 permits the holder to sell certain amounts of restricted securities one year following the date of acquisition of the restricted securities from us and, after two years, permits unlimited sales by persons unaffiliated with us. Commencing generally on the first anniversary of the date of acquisition of common limited partnership units (or such other date agreed to by the operating partnership and the holders of the units), the operating partnership may redeem common limited partnership units at the request of the holders for cash (based on the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of common stock at the time of redemption) or, at the option of the operating partnership, exchange the common limited partnership units for an equal number of shares of our common stock, subject to certain antidilution adjustments. The operating partnership had issued and outstanding 4,846,387 common limited partnership units as of December 31, 2002. As of December 31, 2002, we had reserved 17,336,237 shares of common stock for issuance under our Stock Option and Incentive Plans (not including shares that we have already issued) and, as of December 31, 2002, we had granted to certain directors, officers and employees options to purchase 8,764,912 shares of common stock (excluding forfeitures and 896,152 shares that we have issued pursuant to the exercise of options). As of December 31, 2002, we had granted 717,611 restricted shares of common stock, excluding 36,200 shares that have been forfeited. In addition, we may issue additional shares of common stock and the operating partnership may issue additional limited partnership units in connection with the acquisition of properties. In connection with the issuance of common limited partnership units to other transferors of properties, and in connection with the issuance of the performance units, we have agreed to file registration statements covering the issuance of shares of common stock upon the exchange of the common limited partnership units. We have also filed registration statements with respect to the shares of common stock issuable under our stock option and incentive plans. These registration statements and registration rights 50 generally allow shares of common stock covered thereby, including shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of limited partnership units, including performance units, or the exercise of options or restricted shares of common stock, to be transferred or resold without restriction under the Securities Act. We may also agree to provide registration rights to any other person who may become an owner of the operating partnership’s limited partnership units. Future sales of the shares of common stock described above could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The existence of the operating partnership’s limited partnership units, options, and shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange of limited partnership units, and the exercise of options and registration rights referred to above, also may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities. Item 7a. Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes: (1) interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings; and (2) our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2002, we had no interest rate caps or swaps. See “Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Capital Resources — Market Capitalization.” The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rated debt outstanding before unamortized debt premiums of $9.8 million as of December 31, 2002: Expected Maturity 2003 2004 2005 2006 Date 2007 Thereafter Total Debt Fixed rate debt (1) $ 93,088 $ 98,490 $ 351,996 $ 167,804 $ 136,120 $ 1,171,945 $ 2,019,443 Average interest rate 7.8% 8.0% 7.3% 7.4% 7.4% 7.3% 7.4% Variable rate debt (2) $ 47,279 $ 30.504 $ 98,488 $ 8,593 $ 6,868 $ 14,368 $ 206,100 Average interest rate 2.8% 3.3% 2.1% 3.1% 3.1% 4.4% 2.7% (1) Represents 93.9% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 6.1% of all outstanding debt. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased by 10% (or approximately 27 basis points), then the increase in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $0.6 million annually. As of December 31, 2002, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt was $2,152.6 million based on our estimate of current market interest rates.",2023-12-30 18:37:00.500362
1045609,PLD,"Prologis, Inc.",2005,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL You should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements. We commenced operations as a fully integrated real estate company effective with the completion of our initial public offering on November 26, 1997, and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with our initial tax return for the year ended December 31, 1997. AMB Property Corporation and AMB Property, L.P. were formed shortly before the consummation of our initial public offering. Management’s Overview We generate revenue and earnings primarily from rent received from customers under long-term (generally three to ten years) operating leases at our properties, including reimbursements from customers for certain operating costs, and from partnership distributions and fees from our private capital business. We also derive earnings from the strategic disposition of assets and from the disposition of projects under our development-for-sale or contribution program. Our long-term growth is dependent on our ability to maintain and increase occupancy rates or increase rental rates at our properties and our ability to continue to acquire and develop new properties. National industrial markets improved significantly during 2004 when compared with market conditions in 2003. The positive trend in demand began in the second quarter of 2004 and reversed 14 prior quarters of negatively trending, or rising, space availability. We believe the protracted period of rising availability created a difficult leasing environment; however investor demand for industrial property (as evidenced by our observation of strong national sales volumes and declining acquisition capitalization rates) has remained consistently strong. We believe we capitalized on the demand for acquisition property by accelerating the repositioning of our portfolio through the disposition of non-core properties. We plan to continue selling selected assets on an opportunistic basis but believe we have substantially achieved our repositioning goals. Property dispositions result in reinvestment capacity and trigger gain/loss recognition, but also create near-term earnings dilution if the capital cannot be redeployed effectively. We experienced such near-term dilution in 2004. However, we believe that the repositioning of our portfolio will benefit our stockholders in the long-term. The table below summarizes our leasing activity for 2004 and 2003: U.S. Hub and Total Other Total/Weighted Property Data Gateway Markets(1) Markets(2) Average For the year ended December 31, 2004: % of total rentable square feet 74.1 % 25.9 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 95.0 % 94.2 % 94.8 % Same space square footage leased 13,932,213 3,553,563 17,485,776 Rent increases (decreases) on renewals and rollovers (15.3 )% (3.6 )% (13.2 )% For the year ended December 31, 2003: % of total rentable square feet 75.0 % 25.0 % 100.0 % Occupancy percentage at year end 93.5 % 91.9 % 93.1 % Same space square footage leased 13,636,050 3,636,967 17,273,017 Rent increases (decreases) on renewals and rollovers (12.7 )% 1.7 % (10.1 )% 25 (1) Our U.S. hub and gateway markets include on-tarmac and Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas/ Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/ New York City, the San Francisco Bay Area, Miami and Seattle. (2) Our total other markets include other domestic target markets, other non-target markets, international target markets and retail. We observed two positive trends nationally for industrial real estate during the year ended December 31, 2004, supported by data provided by Torto Wheaton Research. First, national industrial space availability declined 70 basis points during the year from 11.6% to 10.9%. This decrease in national industrial space availability occurred in the last three quarters of 2004, reversing the trend of the prior 14 quarters in which national industrial space availability increased on average 36 basis points per quarter. Second, national absorption of industrial space, defined as the net change in occupied stock as measured by square feet of completions less the change in available square feet, totaled approximately 175 million square feet in the year ended December 31, 2004, substantially exceeding the 20 million square feet of space absorbed in 2003 and well above the ten-year historical average of 132 million square feet of space absorbed annually. In this improved environment, our industrial portfolio’s occupancy levels increased to 94.8% at December 31, 2004 from 93.1% at December 31, 2003, which we believe reflects higher levels of demand for industrial space generally and in our portfolio specifically. During the year ended December 31, 2004, our lease expirations totaled approximately 21.4 million square feet while commencements of new or renewed leases totaled approximately 24.3 million square feet, resulting in an increase in our occupancy level of approximately 170 basis points. Rents on industrial renewals and rollovers in our portfolio decreased 13.2% during the year ended December 31, 2004 as leases were entered into or renewed at rates consistent with what we believe to be current market levels. We believe this decline in rents on lease renewals and rollovers reflects trends in national industrial space availability. We believe that relatively high levels of national industrial space availability have caused market rents for industrial properties to decline between 10% and 20% from their peak levels in 2001 based on our research data; 47% of the space that rolled over in our portfolio in 2004 had commenced between 1999 and 2001. Rental rates in our portfolio declined at successively lower rates in each of the four quarters during 2004, which we believe indicates a stabilization of market rental rate levels. While the level of rental rate reduction varied by market, we achieved occupancy levels in our portfolio 570 basis points in excess of the national industrial market, as determined by Torto Wheaton Research, by pricing lease renewals and new leases with sensitivity to local market conditions. During periods of decreasing or stabilizing rental rates, we strove to sign leases with shorter terms to prevent locking in lower rent levels for long periods and to be prepared to sign new, longer-term leases during periods of growing rental rates. When we sign leases of shorter duration, we attempt to limit overall leasing costs and capital expenditures by offering different grades of tenant improvement packages, appropriate to the lease term. We believe that development, renovation and expansion of well-located, high-quality industrial properties should generally continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities at a higher rate of return than we may obtain from the purchase of existing properties. We believe that our development opportunities in Mexico and Japan are attractive given the current lack of supply of modern distribution facilities in the major metropolitan markets of these countries. Globally, we have increased our development pipeline from a low of $107.0 million at the end of 2002 to approximately $828.7 million at December 31, 2004. In addition to our committed development pipeline, we hold a total of 1,263 acres for future development or sale, of which 1,015 acres, 199 acres, 39 acres and ten acres in North America, Mexico, Asia and Europe, respectively, could support an aggregate of approximately 22.2 million square feet of additional development. Going forward, we believe that our co-investment program with private-capital investors will continue to serve as a significant source of revenues and capital for acquisitions and developments. Through these co-investment joint ventures, we typically earn acquisition and development fees, asset management fees and priority distributions, as well as promoted interests and incentive distributions based on the performance of the co-investment joint ventures; however, there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so. Through contribution of development properties to our co-investment joint ventures, we expect to recognize value 26 creation from our development pipeline. As of December 31, 2004, we owned approximately 40.8 million square feet of our properties (36.8% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our co-investment joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. By 2007, we plan to have approximately 15% of our portfolio (based on consolidated annualized base rent) invested in international markets. Our North American target markets outside of the United States currently include Guadalajara, Mexico City, Monterrey and Toronto. Our European target markets currently include Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, London, Lyon, Madrid and Paris. Our Asian target markets currently include Beijing, Nagoya, Osaka, the Pearl River Delta, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo. It is possible that our target markets will change over time to reflect experience, market opportunities, customer needs and changes in global distribution patterns. As of December 31, 2004, our international operating properties comprised 4.4% of our consolidated annualized base rent. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income. As a result, we cannot rely on retained earnings to fund our on-going operations to the same extent that other corporations that are not real estate investment trusts can. We must continue to raise capital in both the debt and equity markets to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions and developments. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a complete discussion of the sources of our capital. Summary of Key Transactions in 2004 During the year ended December 31, 2004, we completed the following capital deployment transactions: • Acquired 64 buildings in the United States, Mexico, Europe and Asia, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet, for $695.2 million, including $261.0 million invested through four of our co-investment joint ventures; • Commenced 19 development projects in the United States, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, totaling 6.1 million square feet with an estimated total investment of approximately $648.5 million (using exchange rates in effect at applicable quarter end and year end dates); • Acquired 640 acres of land for industrial warehouse development in various U.S. markets and Mexico City for approximately $68.3 million; • Sold seven land parcels and six development projects available for sale, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $40.4 million; and • Divested ourselves of 21 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office building, aggregating approximately 3.1 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $200.3 million. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 3 and 4 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a more detailed discussion of our acquisition, development and disposition activity. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we completed the following capital markets and other financing transactions: • Obtained long-term secured debt financings for our co-investment joint ventures totaling $243.5 million at an average rate of 5.0%; • Obtained $129.2 million of debt (using exchange rates in effect at applicable quarter end dates) with a weighted average interest rate of 4.5% for international acquisitions, net of the financing for the AMB Ohta Distribution Center development; • Completed the early renewal of the operating partnership’s senior unsecured revolving line of credit in the amount of $500.0 million. The three-year credit facility includes a multi-currency component under which up to $250.0 million can be drawn in Yen, Euros or British Pounds Sterling; 27 • Entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement through AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, providing for loans or letters of credit in a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of up to 24 billion Yen (approximately $233.8 million in U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2004); • Closed on a 20 billion Yen financing (approximately $195 million U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2004) for the AMB Ohta Distribution Center development project in Japan, of which 14 billion Yen ($136 million U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2004) has been funded. We locked in the interest rate on 65% of the financing for the full eight-year term at closing. During construction, the fixed rate portion is locked at 1.9% and upon stabilization, the fixed rate will be 2.4%; • Formed AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open-ended co-investment joint venture, with $136.5 million of equity from co-investment partners to invest in properties in the United States; and • Formed an unconsolidated co-investment joint venture, AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, with Industrial (Mexico) JV Pte Ltd, a real estate investment subsidiary of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, with an equity commitment of $200 million to invest in properties in Mexico, in which we retain a 20% interest. We contributed $71.5 million of operating properties and recently completed development projects in Mexico and when combined with our equity commitment and leverage, the venture has an investment capacity of approximately $715 million. This is our first international co-investment joint venture. See Part IV, Item 15: Notes 6, 9 and 11 of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for a more detailed discussion of our capital markets transactions. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Investments in Real Estate. Investments in real estate are stated at cost unless circumstances indicate that cost cannot be recovered, in which case the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value. We also record at acquisition an intangible asset or liability for the value attributable to above or below-market leases, in-place leases and lease origination costs for all acquisitions. Carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property-by-property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than the carrying amount of the property. The estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future market conditions and the availability of capital. Examples of certain situations that could affect future cash flows of a property may include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in occupancy; unforeseen bankruptcy, lease termination and move-out of a major customer; or a significant decrease in annual base rents of that property. If impairment analysis assumptions change, then an adjustment to the carrying amount of our long-lived assets could occur in the future period in which the assumptions change. To the extent that a property is impaired, the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to earnings. 28 Revenue Recognition. We record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If customers fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts, security deposits and letters of credit, then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our customers on an on-going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate. Each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable, including straight-line rents, for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed. We also record lease termination fees when a customer has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us. If a customer remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement, the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such customer’s occupancy. Property Dispositions. We report real estate dispositions in three separate categories on our consolidated statements of operations. First, when we divest a portion of our interests in real estate entities or properties, gains from the sale represent the interests acquired by third-party investors for cash. Second, we dispose of value-added conversion projects and build-to-suit and speculative development projects for which we have not generated material operating income prior to sale. The gain or loss recognized from the disposition of these projects is reported net of estimated taxes, when applicable. Lastly, beginning in 2002, SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, required us to separately report as discontinued operations the historical operating results attributable to operating properties sold and the applicable gain or loss on the disposition of the properties. The consolidated statements of operations for prior periods are also adjusted to conform with this classification. There is no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial position, net income or cash flows. In all cases, gains and losses are recognized using the full accrual method of accounting. Gains relating to transactions which do not meet the requirements of the full accrual method of accounting are deferred and recognized when the full accrual method of accounting criteria are met. Joint Ventures. We hold interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Our joint venture investments do not meet the variable interest entity criteria under FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. Therefore, we determine consolidation based on standards set forth in EITF 96-16, Investor’s Accounting for an Investee When the Investor Has a Majority of the Voting Interest but the Minority Shareholder or Shareholders Have Certain Approval or Veto Rights, and Statement of Position 78-9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures. Based on the guidance set forth in these pronouncements, we consolidate certain joint venture investments because we exercise significant control over major operating decisions, such as approval of budgets, selection of property managers, asset management, investment activity and changes in financing. For joint ventures where we do not exercise significant control over major operating and management decisions, but where we exercise significant influence, we use the equity method of accounting and do not consolidate the joint venture for financial reporting purposes. Real Estate Investment Trust. As a real estate investment trust, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income taxes in the U.S. if we meet minimum distribution, income, asset and shareholder tests. However, some of our subsidiaries may be subject to federal and state taxes. In addition, foreign entities may also be subject to the taxes of the host country. An income tax allocation is required to be estimated on our taxable income arising from our taxable REIT subsidiaries and international entities. A deferred tax component could arise based upon the differences in GAAP versus tax income for items such as depreciation and gain recognition. However, we believe deferred tax is an immaterial component of our consolidated balance sheet. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The analysis below includes changes attributable to same store growth, acquisitions, development activity and divestitures. Same store properties are those that we owned during both the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding development properties prior to being stabilized subsequent to December 31, 2002 29 (generally defined as properties that are 90% leased or properties for which we have held a certificate of occupancy or where building has been substantially complete for at least 12 months). As of December 31, 2004, same store industrial properties consisted of properties aggregating approximately 74.5 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2003 consisted of 82 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet. During 2004, property divestitures and contributions consisted of 29 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office, aggregating approximately 4.4 million square feet. In 2003, property divestitures consisted of 48 industrial buildings and two retail centers, aggregating approximately 5.3 million square feet. Our future financial condition and results of operations, including rental revenues, may be impacted by the acquisition of additional properties and dispositions. Our future revenues and expenses may vary materially from historical results. For the Years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 (dollars in millions) Revenues 2004 2003 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 531.8 $ 535.4 $ (3.6 ) (0.7 )% 2003 acquisitions 47.8 14.6 33.2 227.4 % 2004 acquisitions 25.9 — 25.9 — % Development 7.8 7.8 — — % Other industrial 10.3 6.3 4.0 63.5 % International industrial 25.6 6.1 19.5 319.7 % Retail 3.6 3.1 0.5 16.1 % Total rental revenues 652.8 573.3 79.5 13.9 % Private capital income 12.9 13.3 (0.4 ) (3.0 )% Total revenues $ 665.7 $ 586.6 $ 79.1 13.5 % The decrease in U.S. industrial same store rental revenues was primarily driven by decreased rental rates in various markets. Across the portfolio, these and other factors accounted for approximately $6.9 million of the change from the prior year. This decrease was partially offset by a decrease in allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $3.3 million. Industrial same store occupancy was 95.3% at December 31, 2004 and 93.0% at December 31, 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, rents in the same store portfolio decreased 14.7% on industrial renewals and rollovers (cash basis) on 16.2 million square feet leased due to decreases in market rates. The properties acquired during 2003 consisted of 82 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet. The properties acquired during 2004 consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2003 and 2004, we continued to acquire properties in France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The decrease in private capital income was due to greater incentive fees earned in the prior year. 30 Costs and Expenses 2004 2003 $ Change % Change Property operating costs: Rental expenses $ 94.7 $ 84.7 $ 10.0 11.8 % Real estate taxes 73.8 67.3 6.5 9.7 % Total property operating costs $ 168.5 $ 152.0 $ 16.5 10.9 % Property operating costs U.S. industrial: Same store $ 141.1 $ 141.4 $ (0.3 ) (0.2 )% 2003 acquisitions 11.0 3.6 7.4 205.6 % 2004 acquisitions 6.9 — 6.9 — % Development 1.5 3.6 (2.1 ) (58.3 )% Other industrial 1.8 1.8 — — % International industrial 4.9 0.4 4.5 1,125.0 % Retail 1.3 1.2 0.1 8.3 % Total property operating costs 168.5 152.0 16.5 10.9 % Depreciation and amortization 160.0 132.2 27.8 21.0 % Impairment losses — 5.3 (5.3 ) (100.0 )% General and administrative 59.0 46.4 12.6 27.2 % Fund costs 1.7 0.8 0.9 112.5 % Total costs and expenses $ 389.2 $ 336.7 $ 52.5 15.6 % Same store properties’ operating expenses showed a decrease of $0.3 million from the prior year due to decreased non-reimbursable expenses. The 2003 acquisitions consisted of 82 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet. The 2004 acquisitions consisted of 64 buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2003 and 2004, we continued to acquire properties in France, Germany, Japan, Mexico and the Netherlands, resulting in increased international industrial property operating costs. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate. The 2003 impairment loss was on investments in real estate and leasehold interests. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock-based compensation expense of $2.3 million and additional staffing and expenses for new initiatives, including our international and development expansions. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co-investment joint ventures. The increase in fund costs was due to additional formation of co-investment joint ventures in 2004. Other Income and (Expenses) 2004 2003 $ Change % Change Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures, net $ 3.8 $ 5.5 $ (1.7 ) (30.9 )% Interest and other income 4.0 4.0 — — % Gains from dispositions of real estate interests 5.2 7.4 (2.2 ) (29.7 )% Development profits, net of taxes 8.5 14.4 (5.9 ) (41.0 )% Interest expense, including amortization (157.9 ) (146.2 ) 11.7 8.0 % Total other income and (expenses), net $ (136.4 ) $ (114.9 ) $ 21.5 18.7 % The $1.7 million decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was primarily due to decreased occupancy at a property held by one of our joint ventures and increased non-reimbursable expenses. 31 This decrease was offset by the receipt of a lease termination fee at the above-mentioned property in Chicago in the first quarter of 2004. The gains from dispositions of real estate (not classified as discontinued operations) in 2004, resulted from our contribution of $71.5 million in operating properties to our newly formed unconsolidated co-investment joint venture, AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC. The gains from disposition of real estate (not classified as discontinued operations) in 2003, resulted from our contribution of $94.0 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co-investment joint venture, Industrial Fund I, LLC. The decrease in development profits, net of taxes, resulted from delayed gains on development sales. The increase in interest expense, including amortization, was due to the issuance of additional unsecured debt under our 2002 medium-term note program, increased borrowings on the unsecured credit facilities, and additional secured debt borrowings in our co-investment joint ventures. Discontinued Operations 2004 2003 $ Change % Change Income attributable to discontinued operations, net of minority interests $ 5.6 $ 18.9 $ (13.3 ) (70.4 )% Gains from dispositions of real estate, net of minority interests 42.0 42.9 (0.9 ) (2.1 )% Total discontinued operations $ 47.6 $ 61.8 $ (14.2 ) (23.0 )% During 2004, we divested ourselves of 21 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office building, aggregating approximately 3.1 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $200.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.0 million. During 2003, we divested ourselves of 24 industrial buildings and two retail centers, aggregating approximately 2.8 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $272.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.9 million. The decrease in income attributable to discontinued operations reflects the fact that properties were held for only a partial period in 2004 versus an entire year in 2003. Preferred Stock 2004 2003 $ Change % Change Preferred stock dividends $ (7.1 ) $ (7.0 ) $ 0.1 1.4 % Preferred stock and unit (issuance costs or premium) — (5.4 ) (5.4 ) (100.0 )% Total preferred stock $ (7.1 ) $ (12.4 ) $ (5.3 ) (42.7 )% In July 2003, we redeemed all 3,995,800 outstanding shares of our 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and recognized a reduction of income available to common stockholders of $3.7 million for the original issuance costs. In addition, on November 26, 2003, the operating partnership redeemed all 1,300,000 of its outstanding 85/8% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Partnership Units and we recognized a reduction of income available to common stockholders of $1.7 million for the original issuance costs. In June and November 2003, we issued 2,000,000 shares of 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and 2,300,000 shares of 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, respectively. The timing of the newly issued shares contributed to the increase in preferred stock dividends. 32 For the Years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 (dollars in millions) Revenues 2003 2002 $ Change % Change Rental revenues U.S. industrial: Same store $ 535.4 $ 529.2 $ 6.2 1.2 % 2003 acquisitions 14.6 — 14.6 — % Development 7.8 3.9 3.9 100.0 % Other industrial 6.3 13.1 (6.8 ) (51.9 )% International industrial 6.1 0.7 5.4 771.4 % Retail 3.1 5.1 (2.0 ) (39.2 )% Total rental revenues 573.3 552.0 21.3 3.9 % Private capital income 13.3 11.2 2.1 18.8 % Total revenues $ 586.6 $ 563.2 $ 23.4 4.2 % The increase in U.S. industrial same store revenues were primarily driven by increased rental revenues in our on-tarmac and Los Angeles markets. These increases were partially offset by decreased rental income in our San Francisco Bay Area market and an increase in our allowances for doubtful accounts of $4.0 million across the portfolio. The properties acquired during 2003 consisted of 82 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet. The development revenue increase reflects the timing of the stabilization of properties in the development pipeline. Other industrial revenues include rental revenues from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development projects that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. In 2003, we acquired properties in Mexico and France, resulting in increased international industrial revenues. The increase in private capital income was primarily due to incentive distributions earned from AMB Partners II, L.P.

The 2003 acquisitions consist of 82 buildings, aggregating approximately 6.5 million square feet. Other industrial expenses include expenses from divested properties that have been contributed to an unconsolidated joint venture, and accordingly are not classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements, and development properties that have reached certain levels of operation and are not yet part of the same store operating pool of properties. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to the increase in our net investment in real estate, partially offset by a reduction of $2.1 million for the recovery, through the settlement of a lawsuit, of capital expenditures paid in prior years. The 2003 impairment loss was on investments in real estate and leasehold interests. The 2002 impairment included losses for lease cost write-offs of $1.7 million and an impairment on a portion of our planned property contributions of $1.2 million. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock-based compensation expense of $2.8 million, partially offset by decreased personnel costs and taxes. Fund costs represent general and administrative costs paid to third parties associated with our co-investment joint ventures. Other Income and (Expenses) 2003 2002 $ Change % Change Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures, net $ 5.5 $ 5.7 $ (0.2 ) (3.5 )% Interest and other income 4.0 9.4 (5.4 ) (57.4 )% Gains from dispositions of real estate interests 7.4 8.8 (1.4 ) (15.9 )% Development profits, net of taxes 14.4 1.2 13.2 1,100.0 % Interest expense, including amortization (146.2 ) (142.9 ) 3.3 2.3 % Total other income and (expenses), net $ (114.9 ) $ (117.8 ) $ (2.9 ) (2.5 )% The decrease in interest and other income was primarily due to the repayment in full of a $74.0 million 9.5% mortgage note receivable in July 2002. Gains from dispositions of real estate (not classified as discontinued operations) in 2003 resulted from our contribution of $94.0 million in operating properties to our unconsolidated co-investment joint venture, Industrial Fund I, LLC, in February 2003. We recognized a gain of $7.4 million on the contribution, representing the portion of our interest in the contributed properties acquired by the third-party investors for cash. During 2002, we sold two industrial buildings and one retail center, aggregating approximately 0.8 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $50.6 million, with a resulting loss of $0.8 million. In June 2002, we also contributed $76.9 million in operating properties to our consolidated co-investment joint venture, AMB-SGP, L.P. We recognized a gain of $3.3 million, representing the sale of our interests in the properties acquired by the third-party investors for cash. In November 2002, our joint venture partner in AMB Partners II, L.P. increased its ownership from 50% to 80% by acquiring 30% of the operating partnership’s interest in AMB Partners II, L.P. We recognized a gain of $6.3 million on the sale of the operating partnership’s 30% interest.

In addition, on November 26, 2003, the operating partnership redeemed all 1,300,000 of its outstanding 85/8% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Partnership Units and we recognized a reduction of income available to common stockholders of $1.7 million for the original issuance costs. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Balance Sheet Strategy. In general, we use unsecured lines of credit, unsecured notes, preferred stock and common equity (issued by us and/or the operating partnership and its subsidiaries) to capitalize our 100%-owned assets. Over time, we plan to retire non-recourse, secured debt encumbering our 100%-owned assets and replace that debt with unsecured notes. In managing our co-investment joint ventures, in general, we use non-recourse, secured debt to capitalize our co-investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal sources of working capital and funding for acquisitions, development, expansion and renovation of properties will include: • retained earnings and cash flow from operations; • borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities; • other forms of secured or unsecured financing; • proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership (including issuances of limited partnership units in the operating partnership or its subsidiaries); • net proceeds from divestitures of properties; • private capital from co-investment partners; and • contribution of properties and completed development projects to our co-investment joint ventures. We currently expect that our principal funding requirements will include: • working capital; • development, expansion and renovation of properties; • acquisitions, including our global expansion; • debt service; and • dividends and distributions on outstanding common and preferred stock and limited partnership units. We believe that our sources of working capital, specifically our cash flow from operations, borrowings available under our unsecured credit facilities and our ability to access private and public debt and equity capital, are adequate for us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. The unavailability of capital could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. 35 Capital Resources Property Contributions. In December 2004, we contributed $71.5 million in operating properties, consisting of eight industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 1.3 million square feet, to our newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, with Industrial (Mexico) JV Pte Ltd, a real estate investment subsidiary of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, and recognized a gain of $7.2 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed properties acquired by the third-party co-investor for cash. Property Divestitures. During 2004, we divested ourselves of 21 industrial buildings, two retail centers and one office building, aggregating approximately 3.1 million square feet, for an aggregate price of $200.3 million, with a resulting net gain of $42.0 million. Development Sales and Contributions. During 2004, we sold seven land parcels and six development projects as part of our development-for-sale program, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet for an aggregate price of $40.4 million, resulting in an after-tax gain of $6.5 million. During 2004, we also contributed one completed development project into a newly formed unconsolidated joint venture, AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC, and recognized an after-tax gain of $2.0 million representing the partial sale of our interest in the contributed property acquired by the third-party co-investor for cash. Properties Held for Divestiture. As of December 31, 2004, we held for divestiture 25 industrial buildings and one undeveloped land parcel, which are not in our core markets, do not meet our current strategic objectives or which we have included as part of our development-for-sale program. The divestitures of these properties are subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and other customary conditions. As of December 31, 2004, the net carrying value of the properties held for divestiture was $87.3 million. Expected net sales proceeds exceed the net carrying value of the properties. Co-investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co-investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co-investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. We generally consolidate these joint ventures for financial reporting purposes because they are not variable interest entities and because we are the sole managing general partner and control all major operating decisions. However in certain cases, our co-investment joint ventures are unconsolidated. During 2004, we formed AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P. with $136.5 million of equity from co-investment partners to invest in properties in the United States. During 2004, we contributed $71.5 million in operating properties, consisting of eight industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 1.3 million square feet, to our newly formed unconsolidated co-investment joint venture, AMB-SGP Mexico, LLC. Third-party equity interests in the joint ventures are reflected as minority interests in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2004, we owned approximately 40.8 million square feet of our properties (36.8% of the total operating and development portfolio) through our consolidated co-investment joint ventures and 4.6 million square feet of our properties through our other consolidated joint ventures. We may make additional investments through these joint ventures or new joint ventures in the future and presently plan to do so. 36 Our co-investment joint ventures at December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands): Our Approximate Ownership Original Planned Consolidated co-investment Joint Venture Joint Venture Partner Percentage Capitalization(1) AMB/Erie, L.P.

We have authorized for issuance 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which the following series were designated as of December 31, 2004: 1,595,337 shares of series D cumulative redeemable preferred stock; 220,440 shares of series E cumulative redeemable preferred stock; 267,439 shares of series F cumulative redeemable preferred stock; 840,000 shares of series H cumulative redeemable preferred stock; 510,000 shares of series I cumulative redeemable preferred stock; 800,000 shares of series J cumulative redeemable preferred stock; 800,000 shares of series K cumulative redeemable preferred stock; 2,300,000 shares of series L cumulative redeemable preferred stock; and 2,300,000 shares of series M cumulative redeemable preferred stock. On June 23, 2003, we issued and sold 2,000,000 shares of 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at a price of $25.00 per share. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable 37 quarterly in arrears at a rate per share equal to $1.625 per annum. The series L preferred stock is redeemable by us on or after June 23, 2008, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, if any, to the redemption date. We contributed the net proceeds of approximately $48.0 million to the operating partnership, and in exchange, the operating partnership issued to us 2,000,000 6.5% Series L Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. The operating partnership used the proceeds, in addition to proceeds previously contributed to the operating partnership from other equity issuances, to redeem all 3,995,800 of its 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units from us on July 28, 2003. We, in turn, used those proceeds to redeem all 3,995,800 of our 8.5% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $100.2 million, including all accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, to the redemption date. On July 14, 2003, AMB Property II, L.P. repurchased, from an unrelated third party, 66,300 of its series F preferred units for $3.3 million, including accrued and unpaid dividends. On November 25, 2003, we issued and sold 2,300,000 shares of 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at $25.00 per share. Dividends are cumulative from the date of issuance and payable quarterly in arrears at a rate per share equal to $1.6875 per annum. The series M preferred stock is redeemable by us on or after November 25, 2008, subject to certain conditions, for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, if any, to the redemption date. We contributed the net proceeds of $55.4 million to the operating partnership, and in exchange, the operating partnership issued to us 2,300,000 6.75% Series M Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. On November 26, 2003, the operating partnership redeemed all 1,300,000 of its outstanding 85/8% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Partnership Units, for an aggregate redemption price of $65.6 million, including accrued and unpaid dividends. On September 24, 2004, AMB Property II, L.P., a partnership in which Texas AMB I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and our indirect subsidiary, owns an approximate 1.0% general partnership interest and the operating partnership owns an approximate 99% common limited partnership interest, issued 729,582 5.0% Series N Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Limited Partnership Units at a price of $50.00 per unit. The series N preferred units were issued to Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. in exchange for the contribution of certain parcels of land that are located in multiple markets to AMB Property II, L.P. Beginning September 25, 2006 and until and including September 25, 2009, the series N preferred units may be redeemed by AMB Property II, L.P. at a redemption price equal to 99.5% of the original $50.00 per unit capital contribution, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of redemption, which shall be paid solely out of capital contributed to AMB Property II, L.P. by Texas AMB I, LLC or the operating partnership (other than with respect to the accumulated but unpaid distributions). Pursuant to a Put Agreement, dated September 24, 2004, by and between Robert Pattillo Properties, Inc. and the operating partnership, beginning on June 1, 2005 and until January 15, 2006, the holders of the series N preferred units will have the right to sell all, but not less than all, of such units to the operating partnership (or to certain designees) at a price equal to $50.00 per unit, plus all accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of such sale. As of December 31, 2004, $90.8 million in preferred units with a rate of 7.75%, issued by the operating partnership, were callable under the terms of the partnership agreement. In December 2003, our board of directors approved a new two-year common stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of our common stock. We did not repurchase or retire any shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2004. In December 2001, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $100.0 million worth of our common and preferred stock. In December 2002, our board of directors increased the 2001 repurchase program to $200.0 million. The 2001 stock repurchase program expired in December 2003. During 2002, we repurchased 2,651,600 shares of our common stock for $69.4 million, including commissions. In July 2002, we also repurchased 4,200 shares of our series A preferred stock for an aggregate cost of $0.1 million, including accrued and unpaid dividends. 38 During 2003, the operating partnership redeemed 226,145 of its common limited partnership units for cash and 2,000 of its common limited partnership units for shares of our common stock. During 2002, the operating partnership redeemed 122,640 of its common limited partnership units for shares of our common stock. In November 2003, AMB Property II, L.P., one of our subsidiaries, also issued 145,548 of its class B common limited partnership units in connection with a property acquisition. Debt. In order to maintain financial flexibility and facilitate the deployment of capital through market cycles, we presently intend to operate with an our share of total debt-to-our share of total market capitalization ratio of approximately 45% or less. As of December 31, 2004, our share of total debt-to-our share of total market capitalization ratio was 37.8%. Our definition of “our share of total market capitalization” is our share of total debt plus preferred equity liquidation preferences plus market equity. See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratio table contained in Part II, Item 7: “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation — Liquidity and Capital Resources” for our definition of “market equity” and footnote 2 to such table for our definition of “our share of total debt.” However, we typically finance our co-investment joint ventures with secured debt at a loan-to-value ratio of 50-65% per our joint venture partnership agreements. Additionally, we currently intend to manage our capitalization in order to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. Regardless of these policies, however, our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Accordingly, our management could alter or eliminate these policies without stockholder approval or circumstances could arise that could render us unable to comply with these policies. As of December 31, 2004, the aggregate principal amount of our secured debt was $1.9 billion, excluding unamortized debt premiums of $10.8 million. Of the $1.9 billion of secured debt, $1.4 billion is secured by properties in our joint ventures. The secured debt is generally non-recourse and bears interest at rates varying from 0.7% to 10.4% per annum (with a weighted average rate of 6.3%) and has final maturity dates ranging from April 2005 to November 2022. As of December 31, 2004, $1.8 billion of the secured debt obligations bears interest at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 6.5% while the remaining $96.6 million bears interest at variable rates (with a weighted average interest rate of 2.5%). As of December 31, 2004, the operating partnership had issued an aggregate of $1.0 billion in unsecured senior debt securities, which bore a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% and had an average term of 4.6 years. These unsecured senior debt securities include $400.0 million in notes, issued in June 1998, $400.0 million of medium-term notes, which were issued under the operating partnership’s 2000 medium-term note program, and $225.0 million of medium-term notes, which were issued under the operating partnership’s 2002 medium-term note program. As of December 31, 2004, the operating partnership’s 2002 medium-term note program has a remaining capacity of $175.0 million. The operating partnership intends to continue to issue medium-term notes, guaranteed by us, under the 2002 program from time to time and as market conditions permit. In August 2000, the operating partnership commenced a medium-term note program and subsequently issued $400.0 million of medium-term notes with a weighted average interest rate of 7.3%. These notes mature between December 2005 and September 2011 and are guaranteed by us. In May 2002, the operating partnership commenced a new medium-term note program for the issuance of up to $400.0 million in principal amount of medium-term notes, which will be guaranteed by us. On November 10, 2003, the operating partnership issued $75.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes to Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America under the 2002 medium-term note program. We guaranteed the principal amount and interest on the notes, which mature on November 1, 2013, and bear interest at 5.53% per annum. Teachers has agreed that until November 10, 2005, the operating partnership can require Teachers to return the notes to it for cancellation for an obligation of equal dollar amount under a first mortgage loan to be secured by properties determined by the operating partnership, except that in the event the ratings on operating partnership’s senior unsecured debt are downgraded by two ratings agencies to BBB-, the operating partnership will only have ten days after the last of these downgrades to exercise this right. During the period when the operating partnership can exercise its cancellation right and 39 until any mortgage loans close, Teachers has agreed not to sell, contract to sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of, any portion of the notes. On December 9, 2004, we returned $21.1 million of these senior unsecured notes for cancellation and Teachers issued a first mortgage loan in this principal amount that is secured by certain properties in one of our joint ventures. In June 1998, the operating partnership issued $400.0 million of unsecured senior debt securities. Interest on the unsecured senior debt securities is payable semi-annually. The 2015 notes are putable and callable in September 2005. We guarantee the operating partnership’s obligations with respect to its senior debt securities. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions, then our cash flow may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders in all years and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. This increased interest expense would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Credit Facilities. On June 1, 2004, the operating partnership completed the early renewal of its senior unsecured revolving line of credit in the amount of $500.0 million. We remain a guarantor of the operating partnership’s obligations under the credit facility. The three-year credit facility includes a multi-currency component under which up to $250.0 million can be drawn in Yen, Euros or British Pounds Sterling. The line, which matures in June 2007 and carries a one-year extension option, can be increased up to $700.0 million upon certain conditions, and replaces the operating partnership’s previous $500.0 million credit facility that was to mature in December 2005. The rate on the borrowings is generally LIBOR plus a margin, based on the operating partnership’s long-term debt rating, which is currently 60 basis points with an annual facility fee of 20 basis points, based on the current credit rating of the operating partnership’s long-term debt. The operating partnership uses its unsecured credit facility principally for acquisitions, funding development activity and general working capital requirements. The total amount available under the credit facility fluctuates based upon the borrowing base, as defined in the agreement governing the credit facility, which is generally based upon the value of our unencumbered properties. As of December 31, 2004, the outstanding balance on the credit facility was $235.1 million and the remaining amount available was $251.0 million, net of outstanding letters of credit of $13.9 million (excluding the additional $200.0 million of potential additional capacity). The outstanding balance included borrowings denominated in Euros and Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2004, would equal approximately $114.6 million and $92.5 million in U.S. dollars, respectively. As of December 31, 2004, we had an additional outstanding balance of $27.8 million on other credit facilities. On June 29, 2004, AMB Japan Finance Y.K., a subsidiary of the operating partnership, entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement providing for loans or letters of credit in a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of up to 24 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2004, equaled approximately $233.8 million U.S. dollars. We, along with the operating partnership, guarantee the obligations of AMB Japan Finance Y.K. under the revolving credit facility, as well as the obligations of any other entity in which the operating partnership directly or indirectly owns an ownership interest, and which is selected from time to time to be a borrower under and pursuant to the revolving credit agreement. The borrowers intend to use the proceeds from the facility to fund the acquisition and development of properties and for other real estate purposes in Japan. Generally, borrowers under the revolving credit facility have the option to secure all or a portion of the borrowings under the revolving credit facility with certain real estate assets or equity in entities holding such real estate assets. The revolving credit facility matures in June 2007 and has a one-year extension option, which is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of an extension fee equal to 0.25% of the outstanding commitments under the facility at that time. The rate on the borrowings is generally TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the current credit rating of the operating partnership’s long-term debt and is currently 60 basis points. In addition, there is an annual facility fee, payable in quarterly amounts, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s long-term debt, and is currently 20 basis points of the outstanding commitments under the facility. As of December 31, 2004, 40 the outstanding balance on this credit facility, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2004, was $88.8 million in U.S. dollars. On November 24, 2004, AMB Tokai TMK, a Japanese subsidiary of the operating partnership, entered into a secured multi-advance project financing, providing for loans in a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of up to 20 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2004, would equal approximately $194.9 million U.S. dollars. The financing agreement is among AMB Tokai TMK, us, the operating partnership, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and a syndicate of banks. We, along with the operating partnership, jointly and severally guarantee AMB Tokai TMK’s obligations under the financing agreement, pursuant to a guaranty of payment executed in connection with the project financing. The financing is secured by a mortgage on certain real property located in Tokai, Tokyo, Japan, and matures on October 31, 2006 with a one-year extension option. The rate on the borrowings will generally be TIBOR plus a margin, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s long-term debt and is currently 60 basis points per annum, except that AMB Tokai TMK has purchased from Sumitomo an interest rate swap, which has fixed the interest rate payable on a principal amount equal to 13 billion Yen at 1.32% per annum plus the applicable margin. In addition, there is an annual commitment fee based on unused commitments, payable quarterly, which is based on the credit rating of the operating partnership’s long-term debt, and is currently 20 basis points of the amount of unused commitments. The financing agreement contains customary and other affirmative covenants, including financial reporting requirements and maintenance of specified financial ratios, and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of liens and limitations on mergers or consolidations. In addition, Sumitomo, AMB Tokai TMK and the operating partnership signed a commitment letter on November 24, 2004, pursuant to which Sumitomo committed to purchase bonds that may be issued by AMB Tokai TMK in an amount between 10 billion Yen and 15 billion Yen (such amount to be determined by AMB Tokai TMK). The bonds would be secured by the AMB Ohta Distribution Center and would generally accrue interest at a rate of TIBOR plus 1.10% per annum; because the swap purchased by AMB Tokai TMK from Sumitomo is coterminous with the maturity date of the proposed bonds, AMB Tokai TMK will have fixed the interest rate payable on, in general, a principal amount equal to 13 billion Yen at 2.42% per annum. The bonds, if issued, would mature on October 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2004, the outstanding balance on this financing agreement was 14 billion Yen, which, using the exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2004, equaled approximately $136.4 million U.S. dollars. Mortgages Receivable. Through a wholly-owned subsidiary, we hold a mortgage loan receivable on AMB Pier One, LLC, an unconsolidated joint venture. The note bears interest at 13.0% and matures in May 2026. As of December 31, 2004, the outstanding balance on the note was $12.9 million. We also hold a short-term mortgage on a sold property totaling $0.8 million with an interest rate of 12.0%. The mortgage matures in November 2006.

(2) The weighted average interest and maturity for the unconsolidated joint venture debt were 5.3% and 4.9 years, respectively. (3) Our share of total debt is the pro rata portion of the total debt based on our percentage of equity interest in each of the consolidated ventures holding the debt. We believe that our share of total debt is a meaningful supplemental measure, which enables both management and investors to analyze our leverage and to compare our leverage to that of other companies. In addition, it allows for a more meaningful comparison of our debt to that of other companies that do not consolidate their joint ventures. Our share of total debt is not intended to reflect our actual liability should there be a default under any or all of such loans or a liquidation of the joint ventures. The above table reconciles our share of total debt to total consolidated debt, a GAAP financial measure. For the calculation of the joint venture partners’ share of consolidated joint venture debt used in the above table, please see Part 1, Item 2: “Properties held through Joint Ventures, Limited Liability Companies and Partnerships — Co-investment Consolidated Joint Ventures.” (4) Our secured debt and joint venture debt include debt related to international assets in the amount of $269.5 million. Of this, $195.2 million is associated with assets located in Asia and the remaining $74.3 million is related to assets located in Europe.

(4) Our share of total book capitalization is defined as our share of total debt plus minority interests to preferred unitholders and limited partnership unitholders plus stockholders’ equity. Liquidity As of December 31, 2004, we had $109.4 million in cash and cash equivalents (of which $69.0 million was held by our consolidated co-investment joint ventures), and $418.3 million of additional available 43 borrowings under our credit facilities. As of December 31, 2004, we had $37.2 million in restricted cash (of which $21.2 million was held by our consolidated co-investment joint ventures). Our board of directors declared a regular cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 of $0.425 per share of common stock, and the operating partnership announced its intention to pay a regular cash distribution for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 of $0.425 per common unit. The dividends and distributions were payable on January 7, 2005 to stockholders and unitholders of record on December 23, 2004. The series L and M preferred stock dividends were payable on January 17, 2005 to stockholders of record on January 6, 2005. The series E, F, J and K preferred unit quarterly distributions were payable on January 17, 2005. The series D, H and I preferred unit quarterly distributions were payable on December 27, 2004.

Series N preferred units $ 0.70 n/a n/a The anticipated size of our distributions, using only cash from operations, will not allow us to retire all of our debt as it comes due. Therefore, we intend to also repay maturing debt with net proceeds from future debt or equity financings, as well as property divestitures. However, we may not be able to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to obtain future financings on favorable terms or at all would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Capital Commitments Developments. In addition to recurring capital expenditures, which consist of building improvements and leasing costs incurred to renew or re-tenant space, during 2004, we initiated 14 new industrial development projects in the United States and Mexico with a total estimated investment of $235.4 million, aggregating an estimated 3.1 million square feet, four new industrial developments in Japan and Singapore with a total expected investment of $368.8 million, aggregating approximately 2.7 million square feet, and one new industrial development in Europe with a total expected investment of $44.3 million, aggregating approximately 0.3 million square feet. As of December 31, 2004, we had 30 projects in our development pipeline representing a total estimated investment of $828.7 million upon completion, of which four industrial projects with a total of 1.2 million square feet and an aggregate estimated investment of $55.0 million upon completion are held in unconsolidated joint ventures. In addition, we held four development projects available for sale, representing a total estimated investment of $29.2 million upon completion. Of this total, $515.2 million had been funded as of December 31, 2004 and an estimated $342.7 million was required to 44 complete current and planned projects. We expect to fund these expenditures with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances, net proceeds from property divestitures and private capital from co-investment partners, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow. Acquisitions. During 2004, we acquired 64 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 7.6 million square feet for a total expected investment of $695.2 million, of which we acquired 48 industrial buildings aggregating approximately 4.2 million square feet through three of our co-investment joint ventures, for a total expected investment of $261.0 million. We generally fund our acquisitions through private capital contributions, borrowings under our credit facilities, cash, debt issuances and net proceeds from property divestitures. Lease Commitments. We have entered into operating ground leases on certain land parcels, primarily on-tarmac facilities and office space with remaining lease terms from two to 58 years. These operating lease payments are amortized ratably over the terms of the related leases. Future minimum rental payments required under non-cancelable operating leases in effect as of December 31, 2004 were as follows (dollars in thousands): 2005 $ 10,810 2006 11,320 2007 11,280 2008 11,310 2009 11,169 Thereafter 222,437 Total $ 278,326 Co-investment Joint Ventures. Through the operating partnership, we enter into co-investment joint ventures with institutional investors. These co-investment joint ventures are managed by our private capital group and provide us with an additional source of capital to fund acquisitions, development projects and renovation projects, as well as private capital income. As of December 31, 2004, we had investments in co-investment joint ventures with a gross book value of $2.6 billion, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, and investments in an unconsolidated co-investment joint venture of $9.5 million. As of December 31, 2004, we may make additional capital contributions to current and planned co-investment joint ventures of up to $47.9 million. From time to time, we may raise additional equity commitments for AMB Institutional Alliance Fund III, L.P., an open-ended consolidated co-investment joint venture formed in 2004 with institutional investors, which invest through a private real estate investment trust. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of this fund, we are obligated to contribute 20% of the total equity commitments to the fund until such time our total equity commitment is greater than $150 million, at which time, our obligation is reduced to 10% of the total equity commitments. We expect to fund these contributions with cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, debt or equity issuances or net proceeds from property divestitures, which could adversely effect our cash flow. Captive Insurance Company. In December 2001, we formed a wholly-owned captive insurance company, Arcata National Insurance Ltd., which provides insurance coverage for all or a portion of losses below the deductible under our third-party policies. We capitalized Arcata National Insurance Ltd. in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. Arcata National Insurance Ltd. established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of our properties. Annually, we engage an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims, related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. may be adjusted based on this estimate. Premiums paid to Arcata National Insurance Ltd. have a retrospective component, so that if expenses, including losses and deductibles, are less than premiums collected, the excess may be returned to the property owners (and, in turn, as appropriate, to the customers) and conversely, subject to certain limitations, if expenses, including losses, are greater than premiums collected, an additional premium will be charged. As with all recoverable expenses, differences between estimated and actual insurance premiums are recognized in the subsequent year. Through this 45 structure, we believe that we have more comprehensive insurance coverage at an overall lower cost than would otherwise be available in the market. Potential Unknown Liabilities. Unknown liabilities may include the following: • liabilities for clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; • claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with our predecessors prior to our formation transactions that had not been asserted prior to our formation transactions; • accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; • tax liabilities; and • claims for indemnification by the officers and directors of our predecessors and others indemnified by these entities. Overview of Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our debt, interest and lease payments due by period as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands): Less than More than Contractual Obligations 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years Total Debt $ 359,847 $ 743,280 $ 618,012 $ 1,525,286 $ 3,246,425 Debt interest payments 25,154 30,438 36,117 108,280 199,989 Operating lease commitments 10,810 22,600 22,479 222,437 278,326 Total $ 395,811 $ 796,318 $ 676,608 $ 1,856,003 $ 3,724,740 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Standby Letters of Credit. As of December 31, 2004, we had provided approximately $33.6 million in letters of credit, of which $13.9 million was provided under the operating partnership’s $500.0 million unsecured credit facility. The letters of credit were required to be issued under certain ground lease provisions, bank guarantees and other commitments. Guarantees. Other than parent guarantees associated with the unsecured debt of the operating partnership, as of December 31, 2004, we had outstanding guarantees in the aggregate amount of $34.7 million in connection with certain acquisitions and lease obligations of which $8.3 million was backed by standby letters of credit. As of December 31, 2004, we guaranteed $4.8 million on outstanding construction loans on two of our unconsolidated joint ventures. Additionally, we provided a take out guarantee after the completion of construction on the aggregate construction loan amount of $30.2 million for another of our unconsolidated joint ventures, of which $20.9 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2004. In connection with this construction loan, our joint venture partner provides an underlying construction loan guarantee up to the completion of construction. Performance and Surety Bonds. As of December 31, 2004, we had outstanding performance and surety bonds in an aggregate amount of $1.2 million. These bonds were issued in connection with certain of our development projects and were posted to guarantee certain tax obligations and the construction of certain real property improvements and infrastructure, such as grading, sewers and streets. Performance and surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from real estate developers. Performance and surety bonds are renewable and expire upon the payment of the taxes due or the completion of the improvements and infrastructure. Promoted Interests and Other Contractual Obligations. Upon the achievement of certain return thresholds and the occurrence of certain events, we may be obligated to make payments to certain of joint venture partners pursuant to the terms and provisions of their contractual agreements with us. From time to 46 time in the normal course of our business, we enter into various contracts with third parties that may obligate us to make payments or perform other obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES FFO. We believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure. However, we consider funds from operations, or FFO, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. FFO is defined as net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, less gains (or losses) from dispositions of real estate held for investment purposes and real estate-related depreciation, and adjustments to derive our pro rata share of FFO of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. Further, we do not adjust FFO to eliminate the effects of non-recurring charges. We believe that FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. We believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization, FFO can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO also does not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. The following table reflects the calculation of FFO reconciled from net income for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands): 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Net income $ 125,471 $ 129,128 $ 121,119 $ 136,200 $ 121,782 Gains from dispositions of real estate (47,224 ) (50,325 ) (19,383 ) (41,859 ) (7,044 ) Real estate related depreciation and amortization: Total depreciation and amortization 160,026 132,167 121,069 101,455 81,523 Discontinued operations’ depreciation 7,324 10,170 15,434 12,088 8,835 Furniture, fixtures and equipment depreciation (871 ) (720 ) (712 ) (731 ) (380 ) Ground lease amortization — — (2,301 ) (1,232 ) (734 ) 47 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Adjustments to derive FFO from consolidated joint ventures: Joint venture partners’ minority interests (Net income) 37,817 31,726 27,320 23,731 11,086 Limited partnership unitholders’ minority interests (Net income) 3,318 2,890 4,004 5,322 6,676 Limited partnership unitholders’ minority interests (Development profits) 435 344 57 764 — Discontinued operations’ minority interests (Net income) 4,573 4,991 5,105 4,666 2,586 FFO attributable to minority interests (80,192 ) (65,603 ) (52,051 ) (40,144 ) (15,055 ) Adjustments to derive FFO from unconsolidated joint ventures: Our share of net income (3,781 ) (5,445 ) (5,674 ) (5,467 ) (5,212 ) Our share of FFO 7,549 9,755 9,291 8,014 7,188 Preferred stock dividends (7,131 ) (6,999 ) (8,496 ) (8,500 ) (8,500 ) Preferred stock and unit redemption discount (issuance costs) — (5,413 ) 412 (7,600 ) — Funds from operations $ 207,314 $ 186,666 $ 215,194 $ 186,707 $ 202,751 Basic FFO per common share and unit $ 2.39 $ 2.17 $ 2.44 $ 2.09 $ 2.26 Diluted FFO per common share and unit $ 2.30 $ 2.13 $ 2.40 $ 2.07 $ 2.25 Weighted average common shares and units: Basic 86,885,250 85,859,899 88,204,208 89,286,379 89,566,375 Diluted 90,120,250 87,616,365 89,689,310 90,325,801 90,024,511 48 BUSINESS RISKS Our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences to us. These risks include, among others: General Real Estate Industry Risks Our performance and value are subject to general economic conditions and risks associated with our real estate assets. The investment returns available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income earned and capital appreciation generated by the properties, as well as the expenses incurred in connection with the properties. If our properties do not generate income sufficient to meet operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, then our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders could be adversely affected. In addition, there are significant expenditures associated with an investment in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs) that generally do not decline when circumstances reduce the income from the property. Income from, and the value of, our properties may be adversely affected by: • changes in the general economic climate; • local conditions, such as oversupply of or a reduction in demand for industrial space; • the attractiveness of our properties to potential customers; • competition from other properties; • our ability to provide adequate maintenance and insurance; • increased operating costs; • increased cost of compliance with regulations; and • the potential for liability under applicable laws (including changes in tax laws). In addition, periods of economic slowdown or recession in the United States and in other countries, rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate, or public perception that any of these events may occur, would result in a general decrease in rents or an increased occurrence of defaults under existing leases, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future terrorist attacks may result in declining economic activity, which could reduce the demand for and the value of our properties. To the extent that future attacks impact our customers, their businesses similarly could be adversely affected, including their ability to continue to honor their existing leases. Our properties are concentrated predominantly in the industrial real estate sector. As a result of this concentration, we would feel the impact of an economic downturn in this sector more acutely than if our portfolio included other property types. We may be unable to renew leases or relet space as leases expire. As of December 31, 2004, leases on a total of 16.3% of our industrial properties (based on annualized base rent) will expire on or prior to December 31, 2005. We derive most of our income from rent received from our customers. Accordingly, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected if we are unable to promptly relet or renew these expiring leases, if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected. If a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other type of financial distress, then it may be unable to make timely rental payments or renew its lease. Further, our ability to rent space and the rents that we can charge are impacted, not only by customer demand, but by the number of other properties we have to compete with to appeal to customers. 49 Actions by our competitors may decrease or prevent increases of the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. We compete with other developers, owners and operators of real estate, some of which own properties similar to ours in the same submarkets in which our properties are located. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose potential tenants, and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to retain tenants when our tenants’ leases expire. As a result, our financial condition, cash flow, cash available for distribution, trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations could be materially adversely affected. Real estate investments are relatively illiquid, making it difficult for us to respond promptly to changing conditions. Real estate assets are not as liquid as certain other types of assets. Further, as a real estate investment trust, the Internal Revenue Code regulates the number of properties that we can dispose of in a year, their tax bases and the cost of improvements that we make to the properties. In addition, a portion of the properties held directly or indirectly by certain of our subsidiary partnerships were acquired in exchange for limited partnership units in the applicable partnership. The contribution agreements for such properties may contain restrictions on certain sales, exchanges or other dispositions of these properties, or a portion thereof, that result in a taxable transaction for specified periods, following the contribution of these properties to the applicable partnership. These limitations may affect our ability to sell properties. This lack of liquidity and the Internal Revenue Code restrictions may limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions and, as a result, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and our ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We could be adversely affected if a significant number of our tenants are unable to meet their lease obligations. Our results of operations, distributable cash flow and the value of our common stock would be adversely affected if a significant number of our tenants were unable to meet their lease obligations to us. In the event of a significant number of lease defaults, our cash flow may not be sufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders and repay maturing debt. As of December 31, 2004, we did not have any single tenant account for annualized base rent revenues greater than 3.4%. However, in the event of lease defaults by a significant number of our tenants, we may incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord. We may be unable to consummate acquisitions on advantageous terms or acquisitions may not perform as we expect. We acquire and intend to continue to acquire primarily industrial properties. The acquisition of properties entails various risks, including the risks that our investments may not perform as we expect, that we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate our new acquisitions into our existing operations and that our cost estimates for bringing an acquired property up to market standards may prove inaccurate. Further, we face significant competition for attractive investment opportunities from other well-capitalized real estate investors, including both publicly-traded real estate investment trusts and private institutional investment funds. This competition increases as investments in real estate become increasingly attractive relative to other forms of investment. As a result of competition, we may be unable to acquire additional properties as we desire or the purchase price may be significantly elevated. In addition, we expect to finance future acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, proceeds from equity or debt offerings by us or the operating partnership or its subsidiaries and proceeds from property divestitures, which may not be available and which could adversely affect our cash flow. Any of the above risks could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. 50 We may be unable to complete renovation and development projects on advantageous terms. As part of our business, we develop new and renovate existing properties. The real estate development and renovation business involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock, which include: • we may not be able to obtain financing for development projects on favorable terms and complete construction on schedule or within budget, resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs and delays in leasing the properties and generating cash flow; • we may not be able to obtain, or may experience delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations; • the properties may perform below anticipated levels, producing cash flow below budgeted amounts; • substantial renovation and new development activities, regardless of their ultimate success, typically require a significant amount of management’s time and attention, diverting their attention from our day-to-day operations; and • upon completion of construction, we may not be able to obtain, or obtain on advantageous terms, permanent financing for activities that we have financed through construction loans. Risks Associated With Our International Business Our international growth is subject to special risks and we may not be able to effectively manage our international growth. We have acquired and developed, and expect to continue to acquire and develop, properties in international countries. Because local markets affect our operations, our international investments are subject to economic fluctuations in the international locations in which we invest. In addition, our international operations are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as revisions in tax treaties or other laws and regulations, including those governing the taxation of our international revenues, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and, in certain parts of the world, property rights uncertainty and political instability. We cannot predict the likelihood that any of these developments may occur. Further, we have entered, and may in the future enter, into agreements with non-U.S. entities that are governed by the laws of, and are subject to dispute resolution in the courts of, another country or region. We cannot accurately predict whether such a forum would provide us with an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that may arise. And even if we are able to obtain a satisfactory decision through arbitration or a court proceeding, we could have difficulty enforcing any award or judgment on a timely basis or at all. Further, our business has grown rapidly and continues to grow through international property acquisitions and developments. If we fail to effectively manage our international growth, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. Acquired properties may be located in new markets, where we may face risks associated with investing in an unfamiliar market. We have acquired and may continue to acquire properties in international markets that are new to us. When we acquire properties located in these markets, we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures. We work to mitigate such risks through extensive diligence and research and associations with experienced partners, however there can be no guarantee that all such risks will be eliminated. 51 We are subject to risks from potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the other countries in which we invest. We are pursuing, and intend to continue to pursue, growth opportunities in international markets. As we invest in countries where the U.S. dollar is not the national currency, we are subject to international currency risks from the potential fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of those other countries. A significant depreciation in the value of the currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may materially affect our results of operations. We attempt to mitigate any such effects by borrowing under our multi-currency credit facility in the currency of the country we are investing in and, under certain circumstances, by putting in place international currency put option contracts hedging exchange rate fluctuations. For leases denominated in international currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage the international exchange risk. We cannot, however, assure you that our efforts will successfully neutralize all international currency risks. If we do engage in international currency exchange rate hedging activities, any income recognized with respect to these hedges (as well as any international currency gain recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates) may not qualify under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test that we must satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT. Our performance and value are impacted by the local economic conditions of and the risks associated with doing business in California. As of December 31, 2004, our industrial properties located in California represented 27.0% of the aggregate square footage of our industrial operating properties and 27.8% of our industrial annualized base rent. Our revenue from, and the value of, our properties located in California may be affected by local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties) and the local economic climate. Business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics, and other factors may adversely impact California’s economic climate. Because of the number of properties we have located in California, a downturn in California’s economy or real estate conditions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We may experience losses that our insurance does not cover. We carry commercial liability, property and rental loss insurance covering all the properties that we own and manage in types and amounts that we believe are adequate and appropriate given the relative risks applicable to the property, the cost of coverage and industry practice. Certain losses, such as those due to terrorism, windstorms, floods or seismic activity, may be insured subject to certain limitations, including large deductibles or co-payments and policy limits. Although we have obtained coverage for certain acts of terrorism, with policy specifications and insured limits that we consider commercially reasonable given the cost and availability of such coverage, we cannot be certain that we will be able to renew coverage on comparable terms or collect under such policies. In addition, there are other types of losses, such as those from riots, bio-terrorism, or acts of war, that are not generally insured in our industry because it is not economically feasible to do so. We may incur material losses in excess of insurance proceeds and we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance at commercially reasonable rates. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds our insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties, then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from those properties and, if there is recourse debt, then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties. Moreover, as the general partner of the operating partnership, we generally will be liable for all of the operating partnership’s unsatisfied recourse obligations, including any obligations incurred by the operating partnership as the general partner of co-investment joint ventures. Any such losses could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. A number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity. Domestic properties located in active seismic areas include properties in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Memphis and Seattle. Our largest concentration of such properties is in California where, as of 52 December 31, 2004, we had 289 industrial buildings, aggregating approximately 24.4 million square feet and representing 27.0% of our industrial operating properties based on aggregate square footage and 27.8% based on industrial annualized base rent. International properties located in active seismic areas include Tokyo and Osaka, Japan and Mexico City, Mexico. We carry replacement-cost earthquake insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles that we believe are commercially reasonable. We evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants. We are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with properties owned through joint ventures, limited liability companies and partnerships. As of December 31, 2004, we owned approximately 55.6 million square feet of our properties through several joint ventures, limited liability companies or partnerships with third parties. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in partnerships, limited liability companies or joint ventures and we intend to continue to develop and acquire properties through joint ventures, limited liability companies and partnerships with other persons or entities when warranted by the circumstances. Such partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions. Partnership, limited liability company or joint venture investments involve certain risks, including: • if our partners, co-members or joint venturers go bankrupt, then we and any other remaining general partners, members, or joint venturers would generally remain liable for the partnership’s, limited liability company’s, or joint venture’s liabilities; • if our partners fail to fund their share of any required capital contributions; • our partners, co-members or joint venturers might have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals that would affect our ability to operate the property; • our partners, co-members or joint venturers may have the power to act contrary to our instructions, requests, policies, or objectives, including our current policy with respect to maintaining our qualification as a real estate investment trust; • the joint venture, limited liability and partnership agreements often restrict the transfer of a joint venture’s, member’s or partner’s interest or “buy-sell” or may otherwise restrict our ability to sell the interest when we desire or on advantageous terms; • disputes between us and our partners, co-members or joint venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business and result in subjecting the properties owned by the applicable partnership or joint venture to additional risk; and • we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our partners, co-members or joint venturers. We generally seek to maintain sufficient control of our partnerships, limited liability companies, and joint ventures to permit us to achieve our business objectives, however, we may not be able to do so, and the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We may be unable to complete divestitures on advantageous terms or contribute properties. We intend to continue to divest ourselves of properties that do not meet our strategic objectives, provided that we can negotiate acceptable terms and conditions. Our ability to dispose of properties on advantageous terms depends on factors beyond our control, including competition from other sellers and the availability of attractive financing for potential buyers of our properties. If we are unable to dispose of properties on favorable terms or redeploy the proceeds of property divestitures in accordance with our investment strategy, then our 53 financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. We also anticipate contributing or selling properties to funds and joint ventures. If we do not have sufficient properties available that meet the investment criteria of current or future property funds, or if the funds have reduced or no access to capital on favorable terms, then such contributions or sales could be delayed or prevented, adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Contingent or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition. We have and may in the future acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of any of these entities or properties, then we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to entities or properties acquired might include: • liabilities for clean-up or remediation of undisclosed environmental conditions; • accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; • tax liabilities; and • claims for indemnification by the general partners, officers and directors and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties. We are dependent on external sources of capital. In order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain) and are taxed on our income to the extent it is not fully distributed. Consequently, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisition and development activities, from cash retained from operations and must rely on third-party sources of capital. Further, in order to maintain our REIT status and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the REIT distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. These short-term borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. Our ability to access private debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of factors, including, general market conditions, the market’s perception of our growth potential, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our capital stock. Debt Financing Risks We could incur more debt, increasing our debt service. It is our policy to incur debt, either directly or through our subsidiaries, only if it will not cause our share of total debt-to-our share of total market capitalization ratio to exceed approximately 45%. Our definition of “our share of total market capitalization” is our share of total debt plus preferred equity liquidation preferences plus market equity. See footnote 1 to the Capitalization Ratio table contained in Part II, Item 7: “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation — Liquidity and Capital Resources” for our definition of “market equity” and footnote 2 to such table for our definition of “our share of total debt.” The aggregate amount of indebtedness that we may incur under our policy increases directly with an increase in the market price per share of our capital stock. Further, our management could alter or eliminate this policy without stockholder approval. If we change this policy, then we could become 54 more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect the cash available for distribution to our stockholders. We face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk. As of December 31, 2004, we had total debt outstanding of $3.3 billion. We guarantee the operating partnership’s obligations with respect to the senior debt securities referenced in our financial statements. We are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. We anticipate that we will repay only a small portion of the principal of our debt prior to maturity. Accordingly, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. If we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds of other capital transactions, then we expect that our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay all such maturing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase. In addition, if we mortgage one or more of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments, then the property could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a consequent loss of income and asset value. A foreclosure on one or more of our properties could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our financial condition. The terms of our credit agreements and other indebtedness require that we comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage. These covenants may limit flexibility in our operations, and our failure to comply with these covenants could cause a default under the applicable debt agreement even if we have satisfied our payment obligations. As of December 31, 2004, we had certain non-recourse, secured loans, which are cross-collateralized by multiple properties. If we default on any of these loans, we may then be required to repay such indebtedness, together with applicable prepayment charges, to avoid foreclosure on all the cross-collateralized properties within the applicable pool. Foreclosure on our properties, or our inability to refinance our loans on favorable terms, could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. In addition, our credit facilities and senior debt securities contain certain cross-default provisions, which are triggered in the event that our other material indebtedness is in default. These cross-default provisions may require us to repay or restructure the credit facilities and the senior debt securities in addition to any mortgage or other debt that is in default, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect results of operations. We seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements, such as interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements. These agreements involve risks, such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such agreements are not legally enforceable. Hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations. 55 Conflicts of Interest Risks Some of our directors and executive officers are involved in other real estate activities and investments and therefore, may have conflicts of interest with us. Certain of our executive officers and directors own interests in other real-estate related businesses and investments, including retail development projects, office buildings and de minimis holdings of the equity securities of public and private real estate companies. Our executive officers’ continued involvement in other real estate-related activities could divert their attention from our day-to-day operations. Our executive officers have entered into non-competition agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed not to engage in any activities, directly or indirectly, in respect of commercial real estate, and not to make any investment in respect of any industrial or retail real estate, other than through ownership of not more than 5% of the outstanding shares of a public company engaged in such activities or through the existing investments referred to in this report. State law may limit our ability to enforce these agreements. We believe that these properties and activities generally do not directly compete with any of our properties. However, it is possible that a property in which an executive officer or director, or an affiliate of an executive officer or director, has an interest may compete with us in the future if we were to invest in a property similar in type and in close proximity to that property. We will not acquire any properties from our executive officers, directors or their affiliates unless the transaction is approved by a majority of the disinterested and independent (as defined by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange) members of our board of directors with respect to that transaction. Our role as general partner of the operating partnership may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. As the general partner of the operating partnership, we have fiduciary obligations to the operating partnership’s limited partners, the discharge of which may conflict with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, those persons holding limited partnership units will have the right to vote as a class on certain amendments to the operating partnership’s partnership agreement and individually to approve certain amendments that would adversely affect their rights. The limited partners may exercise these voting rights in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our stockholders. In addition, under the terms of the operating partnership’s partnership agreement, holders of limited partnership units will have certain approval rights with respect to certain transactions that affect all stockholders but which they may not exercise in a manner that reflects the interests of all stockholders. Risks Associated with Government Regulations The costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations and any related potential liability could exceed our budgets for these items. Under various environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at, on, under or in its property. The costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial. These laws typically impose liability and clean-up responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury, property damage, or other costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from the environmental contamination. Environmental laws in some countries, including the U.S., also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and 56 may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos. Some of our properties may contain asbestos-containing building materials. In addition, some of our properties are leased or have been leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use, store, or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances. Further, certain of our properties are on, adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or upon which others have engaged, are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances. From time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior risk-adjusted return. In such an instance, we underwrite the costs of environmental investigation, clean-up and monitoring into the acquisition cost and obtain appropriate environmental insurance for the property. Further, in connection with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties. At the time of acquisition, we subject all of our properties to a Phase I or similar environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants and we may have additional Phase II testing performed upon consultant’s recommendation. These environmental assessments have not revealed, and we are not aware of, any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. Nonetheless, it is possible that the assessments did not reveal all environmental liabilities and that there are material environmental liabilities unknown to us, or that known environmental conditions may give rise to liabilities that are greater than we anticipated. Further, our properties’ current environmental condition may be affected by customers, the condition of land, operations in the vicinity of the properties (such as releases from underground storage tanks), or by unrelated third parties. If the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations exceed our budgets for these items, then our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock could be adversely affected. Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar regulations could result in substantial costs. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. If we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, including removing access barriers, then our cash flow and the amounts available for dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected. Our properties are also subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life-safety requirements. We could incur fines or private damage awards if we fail to comply with these requirements. While we believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. Federal Income Tax Risks Our failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust would have serious adverse consequences to our stockholders. We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a real estate 57 investment trust, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. Qualification as a real estate investment trust requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, in order to qualify as a real estate investment trust, we must derive at least 95% of our gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our real estate investment trust taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. These provisions and the applicable treasury regulations are more complicated in our case because we hold our assets through the operating partnership. Legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a real estate investment trust or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. However, we are not aware of any pending tax legislation that would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a real estate investment trust. If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost qualification. If we lose our real estate investment trust status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved. In addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. Certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties. Under the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. Since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are treated as prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions. While we believe that the Internal Revenue Service would not prevail in any such dispute, if the IRS were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes. Risks Associated With Our Dependence on Key Personnel We depend on the efforts of our executive officers. While we believe that we could find suitable replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to pay dividends on, and the market price of, our stock. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers. Risks Associated with Our Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting. The design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. As part of management’s on-going 58 review of our accounting policies and internal control over financial reporting, on October 12, 2004, management determined that there was a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to ground lease depreciation. This weakness resulted in an understatement of depreciation expense and resulted in a restatement of depreciation expense for our results in previously issued financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 and for the quarters ended March 31, 2004 and June 30, 2004. In connection with correcting this error, management modified our system of internal control over financial reporting to remediate the material weakness. As of December 31, 2004, management had appropriately remediated this issue and the material weakness no longer existed. While management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Other deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in our stock price, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operation, financial condition or liquidity. Risks Associated with Ownership of Our Stock Limitations in our charter and bylaws could prevent a change in control. Certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay, defer, or prevent a change in control or other transaction that could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for the common stock. To maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code to include certain entities) during the last half of a taxable year after the first taxable year for which a real estate investment trust election is made. Furthermore, our common stock must be held by a minimum of 100 persons for at least 335 days of a 12-month taxable year (or a proportionate part of a short tax year). In addition, if we, or an owner of 10% or more of our stock, actually or constructively owns 10% or more of one of our customers (or a tenant of any partnership in which we are a partner), then the rent received by us (either directly or through any such partnership) from that tenant will not be qualifying income for purposes of the real estate investment trust gross income tests of the Internal Revenue Code. To help us maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes, we prohibit the ownership, actually or by virtue of the constructive ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, by any single person, of more than 9.8% (by value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the issued and outstanding shares of each of our common stock, series L preferred stock and series M preferred stock. We also prohibit the ownership, actually or constructively, of any shares of our series D, E, F, H, I, J and K preferred stock by any single person so that no such person, taking into account all of our stock so owned by such person, including any common stock or other series of preferred stock, may own in excess of 9.8% of our issued and outstanding capital stock. We refer to this limitation as the “ownership limit.” Shares acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary. Any person who acquires shares in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to any dividends on the shares or be entitled to vote the shares or receive any proceeds from the subsequent sale of the shares in excess of the lesser of the price paid for the shares or the amount realized from the sale. A transfer of shares in violation of the above limits may be void under certain circumstances. The ownership limit may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control and, therefore, could adversely affect our stockholders’ ability to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for the shares of our common stock in connection with such transaction. Our charter authorizes us to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock and to establish the preferences, rights and other terms of any series or class of preferred stock that we issue. Although our board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series or class of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a transaction, including a change in control, that might involve a premium price for the common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. 59 Our charter and bylaws and Maryland law also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of our board of directors, which in turn may delay, defer, or prevent a transaction, including a change in control. Those provisions in our charter and bylaws include: • directors may be removed only for cause and only upon a two-thirds vote of stockholders; • our board can fix the number of directors within set limits (which limits are subject to change by our board), and fill vacant directorships upon the vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even though less than a quorum, or in the case of a vacancy resulting from an increase in the size of the board, a majority of the entire board; • stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or propose business for consideration at a stockholders’ meeting; and • the request of the holders of 50% or more of our common stock is necessary for stockholders to call a special meeting. Those provisions provided for under Maryland law include: • a two-thirds vote of stockholders is required to amend our charter; and • stockholders may only act by written consent with the unanimous approval of all stockholders entitled to vote on the matter in question. In addition, our board could elect to adopt, without stockholder approval, certain other provisions under Maryland law that may impede a change in control. The market value of our stock could be substantially affected by various factors. As with other publicly traded securities, the trading price of our stock will depend on many factors that are not within our control and may change from time to time, including: • the extent of investor interest in us; • the market for similar securities issued by real estate investment trusts; • the general reputation of real estate investment trusts and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities (including securities issued by other real estate-based companies); • general stock and bond market conditions, including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities, that may lead prospective purchasers of our stock to demand a higher annual yield from future dividends; • terrorist activity may adversely affect the markets in which our securities trade, possibly increasing market volatility and causing the further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending; • general economic conditions; and • our financial condition, performance and prospects. Other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in tax laws could also have a significant impact on the future trading price of our stock. Earnings and cash dividends, asset value and market interest rates affect the price of our stock. As a real estate investment trust the market value of our equity securities, in general, is based primarily upon the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash dividends. Our equity securities’ market value is based secondarily upon the market value of our underlying real estate assets. For this reason, shares of our stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per share. To the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves, or other purposes, these retained funds, while increasing the value of our underlying assets, may not 60 correspondingly increase the market price of our stock. Our failure to meet the market’s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of our stock. Further, the distribution yield on the stock (as a percentage of the price of the stock) relative to market interest rates may also influence the price of our stock. An increase in market interest rates might lead prospective purchasers of our stock to expect a higher distribution yield, which would adversely affect our stock’s market price. Additionally, if the market price of our stock declines significantly, then we might breach certain covenants with respect to our debt obligations, which could adversely affect our liquidity and ability to make future acquisitions and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. If we issue additional securities, then the investment of existing stockholders will be diluted. We have authority to issue shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities, and to cause the operating partnership to issue limited partnership units, in exchange for property or otherwise. Existing stockholders have no preemptive right to acquire any additional securities issued by the operating partnership or us and any issuance of additional equity securities could result in dilution of an existing stockholder’s investment. We could change our investment and financing policies without a vote of stockholders. Subject to our current investment policy to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust (unless a change is approved by our board of directors under certain circumstances), our board of directors determines our investment and financing policies, our growth strategy and our debt, capitalization, distribution and operating policies. Although our board of directors does not presently intend to revise or amend these strategies and policies, they may do so at any time without a vote of stockholders. Any such changes may not serve the interests of all stockholders and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, including our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. Shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The operating partnership and AMB Property II, L.P. had 4,746,104 common limited partnership units issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2004, which may be exchanged generally one year after their issuance on a one-for-one basis into shares of our common stock. In the future, the operating partnership or AMB Property II, L.P. may issue additional limited partnership units, and we may issue shares of common stock, in connection with the acquisition of properties or in private placements. These shares of common stock and the shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of limited partnership units may be sold in the public securities markets over time, pursuant to registration rights that we have granted, or may grant in connection with future issuances, or pursuant to Rule 144. In addition, common stock issued under our stock option and incentive plans may also be sold in the market pursuant to registration statements that we have filed or pursuant to Rule 144. As of December 31, 2004, under our stock option and incentive plans, we had 5,103,927 shares of common stock reserved and available for issuance (including cancellations and forfeitures), had outstanding options to purchase 10,220,631 shares of common stock (net of cancellations and forfeitures, and 2,447,390 shares that we have issued upon the exercise of options) and had 1,178,052 restricted shares of common stock outstanding (net of 75,988 shares that have been forfeited). Future sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further, the existence of the operating partnership’s limited partnership units and the shares of our common stock reserved for issuance upon exchange of limited partnership units and the exercise of options, and registration rights referred to above, may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices, interest rates and international exchange rates. Our future earnings and cash flows are dependent upon prevailing market rates. Accordingly, we manage our market risk by matching projected cash inflows from operating, investing and financing 61 activities with projected cash outflows for debt service, acquisitions, capital expenditures, distributions to stockholders and unitholders, and other cash requirements. The majority of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the risk of fluctuating interest rates. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our credit facilities and other variable rate borrowings and our ability to incur more debt without stockholder approval, thereby increasing our debt service obligations, which could adversely affect our cash flows. As of December 31, 2004, we had two outstanding interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amount of $137.1 million (in U.S. dollars). See Financial Instruments disclosure below. The table below summarizes the market risks associated with our fixed and variable rate debt outstanding before unamortized debt premiums of $10.8 million as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands): 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Fixed rate debt(1) $ 358,798 $ 172,312 $ 145,740 $ 386,761 $ 188,305 $ 1,496,223 $ 2,748,139 Average interest rate 7.0 % 6.6 % 6.9 % 6.7 % 4.8 % 7.2 % 6.6 % Variable rate debt(2) $ 1,049 $ 84,037 $ 341,191 $ 5,571 $ 37,375 $ 29,063 $ 498,286 Average interest rate 3.6 % 2.6 % 2.0 % 2.8 % 2.7 % 1.9 % 2.1 % Interest Payments $ 25,154 $ 13,558 $ 16,880 $ 26,069 $ 10,048 $ 108,280 $ 199,989 (1) Represents 84.7% of all outstanding debt. (2) Represents 15.3% of all outstanding debt. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increased by 10%, then the increase in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be $1.1 million annually. As of December 31, 2004, the book value and the estimated fair value of our total consolidated debt (both secured and unsecured) was $3.4 billion based on our estimate of current market interest rates. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, variable rate debt comprised 15.3% and 14.7%, respectively, of all our outstanding debt. Variable rate debt was $498.3 million and $378.0 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. The increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our credit facilities. This increase in our outstanding variable rate debt increases our risk associated with unfavorable interest rate fluctuations. Financial Instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset or liability, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income or income. For revenues or expenses denominated in non-functional currencies, we may use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivative financial instruments in effect at December 31, 2004 were two put options (buy USD/sell MXN) hedging against adverse currency exchange fluctuations of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and two interest rate swaps hedging cash flows of our variable rate borrowings based on 62 Euribor (Europe) and Japanese TIBOR (Japan). The following table summarizes our financial instruments as of December 31, 2004: Maturity Dates Notional Related Derivatives (In thousands) March-05 Dec-08 October-12 Amount Fair Value Interest Rate Swaps: Plain Interest Rate Swap, Japan Notional Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 126,669 $ 126,669 Receive Floating(%) 3M TIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 1.32 % Fair Market Value $ — $ (1,211 ) Plain Interest Rate Swap, Europe Notional Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 10,437 $ 10,437 Receive Floating(%) 3M EURIBOR Pay Fixed Rate(%) 3.72 % Fair Market Value $ — $ (13 ) Foreign Exchange Agreements: Option to Sell MXN/ Buy USD Contract Amount (U.S. Dollars) $ 2,422 $ 2,422 Contract FX Rate 11.50 Contract Premium $ 43 $ 30 Total $ 139,528 $ (1,194 ) International Operations. Our exposure to market risk also includes foreign currency exchange rate risk. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries operating in the United States and Mexico. The functional currency for our subsidiaries operating outside North America is generally the local currency of the country in which the entity is located, mitigating the effect of currency exchange gains and losses. Our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar translate their financial statements into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date. We translate income statement accounts using the average exchange rate for the period and significant nonrecurring transactions using the rate on the transaction date. Losses resulting from the translation are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders’ equity and totaled $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. Our international subsidiaries may have transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. In these instances, non-monetary assets and liabilities are reflected at the historical exchange rate, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period and income statement accounts are remeasured at the average exchange rate for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2004, gains from remeasurement included in our statements of operations were $0.5 million. We also record gains or losses in the income statement when a transaction with a third party, denominated in a currency other than the entity’s functional currency, is settled and the functional currency cash flows realized are more or less than expected based upon the exchange rate in effect when the transaction was initiated. We believe that these gains and losses are immaterial. 63",2023-12-30 18:36:00.167702

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our segment footnote – Note22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for more information with regard to the investments and results of operations of our segments. Competition The existence of competitively priced distribution space available in any market could have a material impact on our ability to rent space and on the rents that we can charge. To the extent we wish to acquire land for future development of properties in our Real Estate Operations segment or dispose of land, we may compete with local, regional, and national developers. We also face competition from investment managers for institutional capital. We believe we have competitive advantages due to (i) our ability to respond quickly to customers’ needs for high-quality distribution space in key global distribution markets; (ii) our established relationships with key customers served by our local personnel; (iii) our ability to leverage our organizational structure to provide a single point of contact for our global customers through our Global Customer Solutions team; (iv) our property management and leasing expertise; (v) our relationships and proven track record with current and prospective investors in our private capital business; (vi) our global experience in the development and management of industrial properties; (vii) the strategic locations of our land that we expect to develop; and (viii) our personnel who are experienced in the land entitlement process. Customers We have developed a customer base that is diverse in terms of industry concentration and represents a broad spectrum of international, national, regional and local distribution space users. At December 31, 2011, in our Real Estate Operations segment, we had 3,163 customers occupying 266.0 million square feet of distribution space. In the unconsolidated properties we manage, we had 2,476 customers occupying 249.3 million square feet of distribution space. In our Real Estate Operations segment, our largest customer and 25 largest customers accounted for 0.6% and 7.2%, respectively, of our annualized base rent at December 31, 2011. Within our Global Customer Solutions team, we develop long-term relationships with our customers and understand their business and needs, serving as their strategic partner for real estate on a global basis. Keeping in close contact with customers and focusing on exceptional customer service sets us apart from other real estate providers as much more than a landlord. We believe that what we offer in terms of scope, scale and quality of assets is unique. Our in-depth knowledge of our markets helps us stay ahead of trends and create forward-thinking solutions for their distribution networks. This depth of customer knowledge results in greater retention and expanded service, which garners additional business from the same customer across multiple geographies. Approximately 50.0 % of our annual base rent is derived from customers who lease from us in more than one location and more than one country. In our Private Capital segment, we consider our private capital investors to be our customers. As of December 31, 2011, we partnered with 117 investors, several of which invest in multiple funds. Employees We employ 1,457 persons in our entire organization. Our employees work in four countries in the Americas (925 persons), in 15 countries in Europe (345 persons) and in three countries in Asia (187 persons). Of the total, we have assigned 862 employees to our Real Estate Operations segment and 67 employees to our Private Capital segment. We have 528 employees who work in corporate and support positions who are not assigned to a segment who may assist with segment activities. We believe our relationships with our employees are good. Our employees are not organized under collective bargaining agreements, although some of our employees in Europe are represented by statutory Works Councils and benefit from applicable labor agreements. Management’s Overview At the time of the Merger, we established key strategic priorities to guide our path over the next two years. These priorities are: • to align our portfolio with our investment strategy while serving the needs of our customers; 5 Table of Contents • to strengthen our financial position and build one of the top balance sheets in the REIT industry; • to streamline our private capital business and position it for substantial growth; • to improve the utilization of our low yielding assets; and • to build the most effective and efficient organization in the REIT industry and to become the employer of choice among top professionals interested in real estate as a career. Align our Portfolio with our Investment Strategy Subsequent to the Merger, we performed a comprehensive review of our owned and managed portfolio, and categorized the portfolio into three main segments – global, regional and other markets. Global markets represent approximately 83% of our overall owned and managed platform (based on our share of net operating income of the properties). Regional markets represent 12% of our total owned and managed platform. We intend to hold only the highest quality class-A product in our regional markets. We also own a small number of assets in other markets, which account for 5% of our owned and managed platform and that we plan to exit from in an orderly fashion in the next few years. By segmenting our markets in this manner, we were able to construct a strategy that includes culling the portfolio for buildings and potentially submarkets that are no longer a strategic fit for the company. We expect to use the proceeds from dispositions to pay down debt and to recycle capital into new development projects or strategic acquisitions. Strengthen our Financial Position We intend to further strengthen our financial position by lowering our financial risk and currency exposure and building one of the strongest balance sheets in the REIT industry. We expect to lower our financial risk by reducing leverage and maintaining staggered debt maturities, which will provide us with more financial flexibility and allow continued access to debt capital markets. This financial flexibility will position us to capitalize on market opportunities across the entire business cycle as they become available. We expect to lower our currency exposure by owning assets outside the U.S. primarily in co-investment ventures in which we maintain an ownership interest and provide services generating private capital revenue. We will accomplish this through contributions and sales to our existing and newly formed co-investment ventures. In addition, we expect that new development projects, particularly in emerging markets such as Brazil, China and Mexico, will be done in conjunction with our private capital partners. We will also reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations by borrowing in local currencies when appropriate. Streamline Private Capital Business We are rationalizing our private capital business in conjunction with our private capital investors. Some of our co-investment ventures have fee structures that do not adequately compensate us for the services we provide. Therefore, we may terminate or restructure certain of these co-investment ventures. In other cases, we may combine some co-investment ventures to gain operational efficiencies. In every case, however, we will work very closely with our partners and venture investors who will be active participants in these decisions. We plan to grow our private capital business with the deployment of the private capital commitments we have already raised, formation of new co-investment ventures and raising incremental capital for our existing co-investment ventures. Improve the Utilization of Our Low Yielding Assets We plan to increase the value of our low yielding assets by stabilizing our operating portfolio to its historical average of 95% leased, completing the build-out and lease-up of our development projects as well as monetizing our land through development or sale to third parties. Build the most effective and efficient organization in the REIT industry and become the employer of choice among top professionals interested in real estate as a career We have identified more than $115 million of Merger cost synergies on an annualized basis, as compared to the combined expenses of AMB and ProLogis on a pre-Merger basis. These synergies include gross general and administrative savings, reduced global line of credit facility fees and lower amortization of non real estate assets. We believe we have realized approximately 90% of these synergies already and expect to realize the full amount by year - end 2012. In addition, we are in the process of implementing a new enterprise wide system that will include a property management/billing system, a human resources system, a general ledger and accounting system and a data warehouse. In connection with this implementation, we are striving to utilize the most effective global business processes with the enhanced system functionality. We have implemented two new compensation plans that we believe will better align employees’ compensation to our performance. We believe these efforts and others will help us with the attainment of this objective. See “Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of our 2011 results and progress attaining the objectives outlined above. Code of Ethics and Business Conduct We maintain a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct applicable to our Board and all of our officers and employees, including the principal co-executive officers, the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer, or persons performing similar functions. A copy of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is available on our website, www.prologis.com. In addition to being accessible through our website, copies of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct can be obtained, free of charge, upon written request to Investor Relations, Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111. Any amendments to or waivers of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct that apply to the principal 6 Table of Contents executive officers, the principal financial officer, or the principal accounting officer, or persons performing similar functions, and that relate to any matter enumerated in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K, will be disclosed on our website. Environmental Matters We are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition. Either the previous owners or we subjected a majority of the properties we have acquired, including land, to environmental reviews. While some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling, none of the environmental assessments has revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and “Item 1A. Risk Factors”. Insurance Coverage We carry insurance coverage on our properties. We determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and our business operations in specific markets. Such coverages include property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from such perils as fire, additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy, named windstorm, flood, earthquake and terrorism; commercial general liability insurance; and environmental insurance. Insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance, self insurance and through a wholly-owned captive insurance entity. We believe that our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties, business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured. However, an uninsured loss could result in loss of capital investment and anticipated revenues and earnings. See further discussion in “Item 1A. Risk Factors”. ITEM 1A. Risk Factors Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, distributable cash flow and value of our securities. These risks include, among others: General Disruptions in the Global Capital and Credit Markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Global market and economic conditions have been challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower growth in most major economies during the last few years. Although signs of recovery may exist, there are continued concerns about the systemic impact of inflation, the availability and cost of credit, a lagging real estate market and geopolitical issues that contribute to increased market volatility and uncertain expectations for the global economy. To the extent there is turmoil in the financial markets, it has the potential to materially affect the value of our properties and investments in our unconsolidated investees, the availability or the terms of financing that we and our unconsolidated investees have or may anticipate utilizing, our ability and that of our unconsolidated investees to make principal and interest payments on, or refinance any outstanding debt when due and may impact the ability of our customers to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments under existing leases. The market volatility over the last several years has made the valuation of our properties and those of our unconsolidated investees more difficult. There may be significant uncertainty in the valuation, or in the stability of the value, of our properties and those of our unconsolidated investees, that could result in a decrease in the value of our properties and those of our unconsolidated investees. As a result, we may not be able to recover the current carrying amount of our investments in real estate properties, including our unconsolidated investees, which may require us to recognize an impairment charge in earnings in addition to the charges we previously recognized. Any additional, continued or recurring disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities. As a global company, we are subject to social, political and economic risks of doing business in many countries. We conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the United States. During 2011, we generated approximately 41.9% or $642 million of our revenue from operations outside the United States. Circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following factors: • difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations in certain regions; • differing employment practices and labor issues; • local businesses and cultural factors that differ from our usual standards and practices; • volatility in currencies; • currency restrictions, which may prevent the transfer of capital and profits to the United States; • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and other laws; • potentially adverse tax consequences; 7 Table of Contents • the responsibility of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws, e.g., with respect to corrupt practices, employment and licensing; • the impact of regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability; • political instability, uncertainty over property rights, civil unrest, drug trafficking, political activism or the continuation or escalation of terrorist or gang activities (particularly with respect to our operations in Mexico); • foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries; and • access to capital may be more restricted, or unavailable on favorable terms or at all in certain locations. Our global growth (including growth in new regions in the United States) also subjects us to certain risks, including risks associated with funding increasing headcount, integrating new offices, and establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate the operations of new offices and to monitor compliance with regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and similar laws. Although we have committed substantial resources to expand our global platform, if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or to adequately manage operational fluctuations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In addition, our international operations and, specifically, the ability of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries, including transfers of cash to pay interest and principal on our debt, may be affected by currency exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences, among other things. The depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. We have pursued, and intend to continue to pursue, growth opportunities in international markets where the U.S. dollar is not the functional currency. At December 31, 2011, approximately 43.5% or $12.1 billion of our total assets are invested in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, Japanese yen and British pound sterling. As a result, we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. A significant change in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, debt covenant ratios and results of operations. Although we attempt to mitigate adverse effects by borrowing under debt agreements denominated in foreign currencies and, on occasion and when deemed appropriate, using derivative contracts, there can be no assurance that those attempts to mitigate foreign currency risk will be successful. Real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets, which may reduce economic returns to investors. Real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions. In addition, significant expenditures associated with real estate investments, such as secured mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments. Like other companies qualifying as REITs under the Internal Revenue Code, we are only able to hold property for sale in the ordinary course of business through taxable REIT subsidiaries in order to not incur punitive taxation on any tax gain from the sale of such property. While we may dispose of certain properties that have been held for investment in order to generate liquidity, if we do not satisfy certain safe harbors or we believe there is too much risk of incurring the punitive tax on any tax gain from the sale, we may not pursue such sales. In the event that we do not have sufficient cash available to us through our operations or available credit facilities to continue operating our business as usual, we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity. Such alternatives may include, without limitation, divesting ourselves of properties, whether or not they otherwise meet our strategic objectives to keep in the long term, at less than optimal terms, incurring debt, entering into leases with our customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms or entering into lease renewals with our existing customers without an increase in rental rates at turnover. There can be no assurance, however, that such alternative ways to increase our liquidity will be available to us. Additionally, taking such measures to increase our liquidity may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, our ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities. Risks Related to our Business General economic conditions and other events or occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated, may impact financial results. We are exposed to general economic conditions, local, regional, national and international economic conditions and other events and occurrences that affect the markets in which we own properties. Our operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties. As of December 31, 2011, approximately 23.0% of our consolidated operating properties or $4.9 billion (based on investment before depreciation) are located in California, which represented 18.8% of the aggregate square footage of our operating properties and 20.8% of our annualized base rent. Our revenue from, and the value of, our properties located in California may be affected by local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties) and the local economic climate. Business layoffs, downsizing, industry 8 Table of Contents slowdowns, changing demographics and other factors may adversely impact California’s economic climate. Because of the number of properties we have located in California, a downturn in California’s economy or real estate conditions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities. In addition to California, we also have significant holdings (defined as more than 3% of total investment before depreciation) in operating properties in certain global and regional markets located in Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, France, Japan, New Jersey/New York City, South Florida and the United Kingdom. Our operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any of the markets in which we have a concentration of properties. Conditions such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for distribution space, among other factors, may impact operating conditions. Any material oversupply of distribution space or material reduction in demand for distribution space could adversely affect our results of operations, distributable cash flow and the value of our securities. In addition, our unconsolidated investees have concentrations of properties in the same markets mentioned above, as well as in markets in Central and Eastern Pennsylvania, Germany, Mexico, Poland and Reno and are subject to the economic conditions in those markets. A number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity. U.S. properties located in active seismic areas include properties in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and Seattle. International properties located in active seismic areas include Japan and Mexico. We generally carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable. We evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants and in some specific instances have elected to self insure our earthquake exposure based on this analysis. We have elected not to carry earthquake insurance for wholly owned assets in Japan based on this analysis. Further, a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to hurricane and/or flood risk. We carry hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to such activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable. We evaluate our insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants. Our insurance coverage does not include all potential losses. We and our unconsolidated investees currently carry insurance coverage including property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from certain perils such as fire and additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy, namely windstorm, flood, earthquake and terrorism; commercial general liability insurance; and environmental insurance, as appropriate for the markets where each of our properties and business operations are located. The insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties, business activities and markets. We believe our properties and the properties of our unconsolidated investees are adequately insured. However, there are certain losses, including losses from floods, earthquakes, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots, that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and future revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our insurance companies will be able to continue to offer products with sufficient coverage at commercially reasonable rates. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties or if our insurance companies fail to meet their coverage commitments to us in the event of an insured loss, then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from those properties and, if there is recourse debt, then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties. Any such losses or higher insurance costs could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities. Investments in real estate properties are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business. Investments in real estate properties are subject to varying degrees of risk. While we seek to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of our portfolio, market research and our property management capabilities, these risks cannot be eliminated. Some of the factors that may affect real estate values include: • local conditions, such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for distribution space in an area; • the attractiveness of our properties to potential customers; • competition from other available properties; • increasing costs of rehabilitating, repositioning, renovating and making improvements to our properties; • our ability to provide adequate maintenance of, and insurance on, our properties; • our ability to control rents and variable operating costs; 9 Table of Contents • governmental regulations, including zoning, usage and tax laws and changes in these laws; and • potential liability under, and changes in, environmental, zoning and other laws. Our investments are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector and our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector. Our investments in real estate assets are primarily concentrated in the industrial distribution sector. This concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities were more diversified. Our operating results and distributable cash flow will depend on the continued generation of lease revenues from customers and we may be unable to lease vacant space or renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms as leases expire. Our operating results and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations. We are also subject to the risk that, upon the expiration of leases for space located in our properties, leases may not be renewed by existing customers, the space may not be re-leased to new customers or the terms of renewal or re-leasing (including the cost of required renovations or concessions to customers) may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. Our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers, we may lose potential customers, and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to retain customers when our customers’ leases expire. In the event of default by a significant number of customers, we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord, and may be unable to re-lease spaces. A customer may experience a downturn in its business, which may cause the loss of the customer or may weaken its financial condition, resulting in the customer’s failure to make rental payments when due or requiring a restructuring that might reduce cash flow from the lease. In addition, a customer may seek the protection of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws, which could result in the rejection and termination of such customer’s lease and thereby cause a reduction in our available cash flow. If we decide to contribute or sell properties to an unconsolidated investee or third parties to generate proceeds, we may not be successful. We may contribute or sell properties to certain of our unconsolidated investees or third parties on a case-by-case basis. Our ability to sell properties on advantageous terms is affected by competition from other owners of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties; market conditions, including the capitalization rates applicable to our properties; and other factors beyond our control. If our competitors sell assets similar to assets we intend to divest in the same markets and/or at valuations below our valuations for comparable assets, we may be unable to divest our assets at favorable pricing or on favorable terms or at all. The unconsolidated investee or third parties who might acquire our properties may need to have access to debt and equity capital, in the private and public markets, in order to acquire properties from us. Should they have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms, then dispositions could be delayed. If we are unable to generate proceeds through property sales we may have to delay our deleveraging plans, which may result in adverse effects on our liquidity, distributable cash flow, debt covenant ratios, and the value of our securities. We may acquire properties, which involves risks that could adversely affect our operating results and the value of our securities. We may acquire industrial properties. The acquisition of properties involves risks, including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and that any actual costs for rehabilitation, repositioning, renovation and improvements identified in the pre-acquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates. When we acquire properties, we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures. Additionally, there is, and it is expected there will continue to be, significant competition for properties that meet our investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities. Our real estate development strategies may not be successful. Our real estate development strategy is focused on monetizing land in the future through sales to third parties, development of industrial properties to hold for long-term investment or contribution or sale to an unconsolidated investee, depending on market conditions, our liquidity needs and other factors. We may expand investment in our development, renovation and redevelopment business and we will complete the build-out and leasing of our development platform. We may also develop, renovate and redevelop properties within existing or newly formed development co-investment ventures. The real estate development, renovation and redevelopment business involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities, which include the following risks: • we may not be able to obtain financing for development projects on favorable terms or at all and complete construction on schedule or within budget, resulting in increased debt service and construction costs and delays in leasing the properties and generating cash flow; • we may not be able to obtain, or may experience delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations; • we may seek to sell certain land parcels and not be able to find a third party to acquire such land or the sales price will not allow us to recover our investment, resulting in additional impairment charges; 10 Table of Contents • development opportunities that we explore may be abandoned and the related investment impaired; • the properties may perform below anticipated levels, producing cash flow below budgeted amounts; • we may not be able to lease properties on favorable terms or at all; • construction costs, total investment amounts and our share of remaining funding may exceed our estimates and projects may not be completed, delivered or stabilized as planned; • we may not be able to attract third party investment in new development co-investment ventures or sufficient customer demand for our product; • we may not be able to capture the anticipated enhanced value created by our redevelopment projects on expected timetables or at all; • we may experience delays (temporary or permanent) if there is public opposition to our activities; and • substantial renovation, new development and redevelopment activities, regardless of their ultimate success, typically require a significant amount of management’s time and attention, diverting their attention from our day-to-day operations. We are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our operating results and financial condition. Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner, developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such hazardous substances. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury, property damage or other costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from the environmental contamination. Environmental laws in some countries, including the United States, also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos. Some of our properties are known to contain asbestos-containing building materials. In addition, some of our properties are leased or have been leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use, store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances. Further, certain of our properties are on, adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or upon which others have engaged, are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances. From time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior risk-adjusted return. In connection with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties. We cannot give any assurance that other such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future. The presence of such substances on our real estate properties could adversely affect our ability to lease, develop or sell such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral and may have an adverse effect on our distributable cash flow. We are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with forming co-investment ventures, investing in new or existing co-investment ventures, attracting third party investment and investing in and managing properties through co-investment ventures. As of December 31, 2011, we have an investment in approximately 277.8 million square feet held through unconsolidated investees. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in unconsolidated investees, and we may and currently intend to develop and acquire properties through co-investment ventures and investments in other entities when warranted by the circumstances. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to form new co-investment ventures, attract third party investment or make additional investments in new or existing co-investment ventures, successfully develop or acquire properties through unconsolidated entities, or realize value from such unconsolidated entities. Our inability to do so may have an adverse effect on our growth, our earnings and the market price of our securities. Our partners in our unconsolidated investments may share certain approval rights over major decisions and some partners may manage the properties in the unconsolidated investees. Our unconsolidated investments involve certain risks, including: • if our partners fail to fund their share of any required capital contributions, then we may choose to contribute such capital; 11 Table of Contents • our partners might have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals that would affect our ability to operate the property; • the venture or other governing agreements often restrict the transfer of an interest in the co-investment venture or may otherwise restrict our ability to sell the interest when we desire or on advantageous terms; • our relationships with our partners are generally contractual in nature and may be terminated or dissolved under the terms of the agreements, and in such event, we may not continue to manage or invest in the assets underlying such relationships resulting in reduced fee revenue or causing a need to purchase such interest to continue ownership; and • disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business and result in subjecting the properties owned by the applicable co-investment venture to additional risk. We generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over our unconsolidated investees to permit us to achieve our business objectives; however, we may not be able to do so, and the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities. Contingent or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition. We have acquired and may in the future acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of any of these entities or properties, then we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow. Contingent or unknown liabilities with respect to entities or properties acquired might include: • liabilities for environmental conditions; • losses in excess of our insured coverage; • accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; • tax, legal and regulatory liabilities; and • claims for indemnification by the general partners, officers and directors and others indemnified by the former owners of our properties. Risks Related to Financing and Capital We face risks associated with the use of debt to fund our business activities, including refinancing and interest rate risks, and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to make required payments on our debt or are unable to refinance our debt. We are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. There can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness, that such refinancing would be on terms as favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness, or that we will be able to otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected and, if the maturing debt is secured, the lender may foreclose on the property securing such indebtedness. Our Global Senior Credit Agreement, Yen-based credit agreement and certain other debt bears interest at variable rates. Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these agreements. In addition, our unconsolidated investees may be unable to refinance indebtedness or meet payment obligations, which may impact our distributable cash flow and our financial condition and/or we may be required to recognize impairment charges of our investments. Covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and breaches of these covenants could adversely affect our financial condition. The terms of our various credit agreements, including our Global Senior Credit Agreement and Yen-based credit agreement, the indentures under which our senior notes are issued and other note agreements, require us to comply with a number of customary financial covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage, leverage ratios, fixed charge ratios and other operating covenants including maintaining insurance coverage. These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness. If we default under the covenant provisions and are unable to cure the default, refinance the indebtedness or meet payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition could be adversely affected. Adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing activity. The credit ratings of our senior unsecured notes and preferred stock are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us. Our credit ratings can affect 12 Table of Contents the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings, and in the event our credit ratings are downgraded, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing. Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments. Adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our refinancing and other capital market activities, our ability to manage debt maturities, our future growth, our financial condition, the market price of our securities, and our development and acquisition activity. We are dependent on external sources of capital. In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain) and we may be subject to tax to the extent our income is not fully distributed. While historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders, we may choose to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, our own stock. For distributions with respect to taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2011, and in some cases declared as late as December 31, 2012, the REIT can satisfy up to 90% of the distribution requirements discussed above through the distribution of shares of our stock if certain conditions are met. Assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisition and development activities, from cash retained from operations and may have to rely on third-party sources of capital. Further, in order to maintain our REIT status and not have to pay federal income and excise taxes, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the REIT distribution requirements even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. These short-term borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. Our ability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of factors, including general market conditions, the market’s perception of our growth potential, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our securities. Federal Income Tax Risks Our failure to qualify as a REIT would have serious adverse consequences. The REIT elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We believe we have operated so as to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and believe that the current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, it is possible that we are organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. Qualification as a REIT requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex sections of the Internal Revenue Code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, in order to qualify as a REIT, the REIT must derive at least 95% of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of the REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. The provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury regulations regarding qualification as a REIT are more complicated in our case because we hold assets through the Operating Partnership. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost the qualification. If we lost our REIT status, our net earnings would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved. Furthermore, we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary REITs which elected to be taxed as REITs under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. Provided that each subsidiary REIT qualifies as a REIT, our interest in such subsidiary REIT will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset tests, and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary REIT will generally be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. To qualify as a REIT, the subsidiary REIT must independently satisfy all of the REIT qualification requirements. If such subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, and certain relief provisions did not apply, it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and its income would be subject to United States federal income tax. In addition, a failure of the subsidiary REIT to qualify as a REIT would have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify as a REIT. Certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties, including by contributing properties to our co-investment ventures. Under the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. We do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property or our contributions of properties into our co-investment ventures are prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties into our co-investment ventures are prohibited transactions. While we believe that the Internal Revenue Service 13 Table of Contents would not prevail in any such dispute, if the Internal Revenue Service were to argue successfully that a transfer, disposition, or contribution of property constituted a prohibited transaction, we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a REIT. Legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us. In recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made to the federal income tax taws applicable to investments in REITs and similar entities. Additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue to occur in the future, and may impact our taxation or that of our stockholders. Risks relating to the Merger The combined company may be unable to integrate its businesses successfully and realize the anticipated synergies and related benefits of the Merger or do so within the anticipated timeframe. On June 3, 2011, AMB and ProLogis completed the Merger. The Merger involved a combination of two companies that previously operated as independent public companies, each of which operated its own private capital platform focused on the industrial real estate sector and served as the sponsor or manager of, or in a similar capacity with respect to, numerous private equity investment vehicles. The combined company is required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of the constituent companies. Potential difficulties the combined company may encounter in the integration process include the following: • the inability to successfully combine the businesses in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the cost savings anticipated to result from the Merger; • the complexities associated with managing the combined businesses out of several different locations and integrating personnel and systems from the two companies; • the additional complexities of combining two companies with different histories, cultures, regulatory restrictions, markets and customer bases; • the failure to retain key employees of either of the two companies; and • performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by completing the Merger. For all these reasons, it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of our management, the disruption of our ongoing business or the diversion of our resources to the integration process as we attempt to complete the integration process, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to security holders and the market price of our securities. Other Risks Risks Associated with our Dependence on Key Personnel. We depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. From time to time, our personnel and their roles may change. In connection with the completion of the Merger, there were changes to our personnel and their roles. While we believe that we have retained our key talent and can find suitable employees to meet our personnel needs, the loss of key personnel, any change in their roles, or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to security holders and the market price of our securities. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain our executive officers, or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees become more expensive, our performance and competitive position could be materially adversely affected. Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar regulations could result in substantial costs. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. If we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, including removing access barriers, then our cash flow and the amounts available to make distributions and payments to our security holders may be adversely affected. Our properties are also subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life-safety requirements. We could incur fines or private damage awards if we fail to comply with these requirements. While we believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. We are subject to governmental regulations and actions that affect operating results and financial condition. Many laws, including tax laws, and governmental regulations apply to us, our unconsolidated investees and our properties. Changes in these laws and governmental regulations, or their interpretation by agencies or the courts, could occur, which might affect our ability to conduct business. 14 Table of Contents Our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting. The design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in the price of our securities, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. We are exposed to the potential impacts of future climate change and climate change related risks. We consider that we are exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate. Our distribution facilities may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events, such as severe storms and/or floods. If the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change, our exposure to these events could increase. We do not currently consider ourselves to be exposed to regulatory risks related to climate change, as our operations do not emit a significant amount of greenhouse gases. However, we may be adversely impacted as a real estate developer in the future by potential impacts to the supply chain and/or stricter energy efficiency standards for buildings. ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. ITEM 2. Properties We are invested in real estate properties that are primarily generic industrial properties. In Japan, our industrial properties are generally multi-level centers, which is common in Japan due to the high cost and limited availability of land. Our properties are typically used for distribution, storage, packaging, assembly and light manufacturing of consumer and industrial products. Based on the square footage of the operating properties included in our Real Estate Operations segment at December 31, 2011 (and discussed below), our properties are 100% industrial properties; including 92.5% used for bulk distribution, 4.4% used for light manufacturing and assembly, 1.3% used for flex industrial, 1.0% used for on-tarmac and 0.8% used for other purposes. Geographic Distribution Our investment strategy focuses on providing distribution and logistics space to customers whose businesses are tied to global trade and depend on the efficient movement of goods through the global supply chain. Our properties are primarily located in two main market types, global markets and regional markets. Global markets account for 85.4% of our consolidated operating properties (based on investment balance) and comprise approximately 30 of the largest and most liquid markets tied to global trade. These markets feature large population centers with high per-capita consumption rates and close proximity to airports, seaports and ground transportation systems. Regional markets account for 10.6% of our consolidated operating properties. Similar to global markets, regional markets benefit from large population centers but typically are not as tied to the global supply chain and are often less supply constrained. 15 Table of Contents The information in the following tables is as of December 31, 2011 for our consolidated operating properties, properties in our development portfolio and land, including 375 buildings owned by entities we consolidate but of which we own less than 100%. All of these assets are included in our Real Estate Operations segment. This includes our portfolio of operating properties we developed or are currently developing. No individual property or group of properties operating as a single business unit amounted to 10% or more of our consolidated total assets at December 31, 2011 or generated income equal to 10% or more of our consolidated gross revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011. These tables do not include properties that are owned by unconsolidated investees.

Operating properties at December 31, 2011 include completed development properties that may be in the initial lease-up phase, which reduces the overall leased percentage. (2) Certain properties are pledged as security under our secured mortgage debt and assessment bonds at December 31, 2011. For purposes of this table, the total principal balance of a debt issuance that is secured by a pool of properties is allocated among the properties in the pool based on each property’s investment balance. In addition to the amounts reflected here, we also have a $12.6 million in encumbrances related to our development portfolio and $147.1 million of encumbrances related to other real estate properties not included in the Real Estate Operations segment. See Schedule III — Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional identification of the properties pledged. (3) Represents the total expected investment when the property under development is completed and leased. This includes the cost of land, development and leasing costs. (4) Included in other investments are: (i) certain other non-industrial real estate; (ii) our corporate office buildings; (iii) land subject to ground leases; (iv) certain infrastructure costs related to projects we are developing on behalf of others; (v) costs incurred related to future development projects, including purchase options on land; and (vi) earnest money deposits associated with potential acquisitions. Unconsolidated Co-Investment Ventures At December 31, 2011, we had an investment in properties through our unconsolidated co-investment ventures that we also managed of 1,403 properties with 267.8 million square feet and a total entity investment of $21.3 billion. See further discussion in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 18 Table of Contents ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we and our unconsolidated investees are parties to a variety of legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe that, with respect to any such matters that we are currently a party to, the ultimate disposition of any such matter will not result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. In December 2011, arbitration hearings began in connection with a dispute related to a real estate development project known as Pacific Commons. The plaintiff, Cisco Technology, Inc. (“Cisco”), is seeking rescission of a 2007 Restructuring and Settlement Agreement (the “Contract”) and other agreements, and declaratory relief, and damages for breach of the Contract. Specifically, Cisco seeks (1) declaratory relief that Prologis owes certain Community Facilities District taxes that have been assessed against Cisco’s land, following Cisco’s purchase of the land from Prologis through the exercise of option agreements; (2) declaratory relief that Prologis’ partial transfers of rights and obligations under the Contract to third parties are void; and (3) damages for alleged breaches of the Contract relating to the plans to build a baseball stadium at Pacific Commons. Although the total damages alleged by Cisco are approximately $200 million, we believe these claims are without merit and are defending these matters vigorously. Based on the facts and circumstances surrounding this dispute, we believe the low end of our range of loss is zero and therefore, in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), we have not recorded any liability with respect to this matter as of December 31, 2011.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and by raising additional third-party capital in our existing ventures. Our Operating Segments As discussed above, our current business strategy includes two operating segments: Real Estate Operations, which includes our Capital Deployment activities, and Private Capital. Please see “Item 1A Risk Factors”, our property information and market presence as presented in “Item 2. Properties”, a discussion of our segment results in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our segment footnote – Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for more information with regard to the investments and results of operations of our segments. Competition The existence of competitively priced distribution space available in any market could have a material impact on our ability to rent space and on the rents that we can charge, which impacts both of our operating segments. To the extent we wish to acquire land for future development of properties in our Real Estate Operations segment or dispose of land, we may compete with local, regional, and national developers. We also face competition from investment managers for institutional capital within our Private Capital segment. We believe we have competitive advantages due to (i) our ability to respond quickly to customers’ needs for high-quality distribution space in key global distribution markets; (ii) our established relationships with key customers served by our local personnel; (iii) our ability to leverage our organizational structure to provide a single point of contact for our global customers through our Global Customer Solutions team; (iv) our property management and leasing expertise; (v) our relationships and proven track record with current and prospective investors in our private capital business; (vi) our global experience in the development and management of industrial properties; (vii) the strategic locations of our land that we expect to develop; and (viii) our personnel who are experienced in the land entitlement process. Customers We have developed a customer base that is diverse in terms of industry concentration and represents a broad spectrum of international, national, regional and local distribution space users. At December 31, 2012, in our Real Estate Operations segment, we had 3,832 customers occupying 296.5 million square feet of distribution space. In the unconsolidated properties we manage, we had 2,703 customers occupying 195.9 million square feet of distribution space. In our Real Estate Operations segment, our largest customer and 25 largest customers accounted for 1.6% and 18.7%, respectively, of our annualized base rent at December 31, 2012. Within our Global Customer Solutions team, we develop long-term relationships with our customers and understand their business and needs, serving as their strategic partner for real estate on a global basis. Keeping in close contact with customers and focusing on exceptional customer service sets us apart from other real estate providers as much more than a landlord. We believe that what we offer in terms of scope, scale and quality of assets is unique. Our in-depth knowledge of our markets helps us stay ahead of trends and create forward-thinking solutions for their distribution networks. This depth of customer knowledge results in greater retention and expanded service, which garners additional business from the same customer across multiple geographies. In our Real Estate Operations segment, approximately 50.0% of our annual base rent is derived from customers who lease from us in more than one location and more than one country. In our Private Capital segment, we consider our private capital investors to be our customers. As of December 31, 2012, we partnered with 107 investors, several of which invest in multiple ventures. Employees We employ 1,445 persons in our entire organization. Our employees work in four countries in the Americas (875 persons), in 15 countries in Europe (385 persons) and in three countries in Asia (185 persons). Of the total, we have assigned 885 employees to our Real Estate Operations segment and 100 employees to our Private Capital segment. We have 460 employees who work in corporate and support positions who are not assigned to a segment who may assist with segment activities. We believe our relationships with our employees are good. Our employees are not organized under collective bargaining agreements, although some of our employees in Europe are represented by statutory Works Councils and benefit from applicable labor agreements. Management’s Overview At the time of the Merger, we established our key strategic priorities to guide our path through the end of 2013. These priorities were: • to align our portfolio with our investment strategy while serving the needs of our customers; • to strengthen our financial position and build one of the top balance sheets in the REIT industry; • to streamline our private capital business and position it for substantial growth; • to improve the utilization of our low yielding assets; and • to build the most effective and efficient organization in the REIT industry and to become the employer of choice among top professionals interested in real estate as a career. 6 Table of Contents Align our Portfolio with our Investment Strategy As discussed above, we have categorized our portfolio into three main segments – global, regional and other markets. By segmenting our markets in this manner, we were able to construct a plan that includes culling the portfolio for buildings and potentially submarkets that are no longer a strategic fit. We expect to use the proceeds from dispositions to pay down debt that is secured by the disposed assets, if any, repay other debt and to recycle capital into new development projects and/or strategic acquisitions. Strengthen our Financial Position We intend to further strengthen our financial position by lowering our financial risk and currency exposure and building one of the strongest balance sheets in the REIT industry. We expect to lower our financial risk by reducing leverage and maintaining staggered debt maturities, which will increase our financial flexibility and provide for continued access to capital markets. This financial flexibility will position us to capitalize on market opportunities across the entire business cycle as they arise. We expect to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations by borrowing in local currency where appropriate, and utilizing derivative contracts to hedge our foreign denominated equity and swap U.S. dollar–denominated debt into obligations denominated in foreign currencies. We expect to also lower our foreign currency risk by holding assets outside the United States primarily in co-investment ventures in which we maintain an ownership interest and provide services generating private capital revenue. We will accomplish this through contributions and sales to our existing and newly formed co-investment ventures, including the new ventures in Europe and Japan discussed below under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. In addition, we expect that new development projects, particularly in those emerging markets such as Brazil, China and Mexico, will be done in conjunction with our private capital partners. Streamline Private Capital Business We are working with our private capital investors to rationalize certain of our co-investment ventures. Some of our legacy co-investment ventures have fee structures that do not adequately compensate us for the services we provide. Therefore, we have terminated or restructured certain of these co-investment ventures. In other cases, we may combine some co-investment ventures to gain operational efficiencies. In every case, however, we have and will continue to work very closely with our partners and venture investors who have been and will be active participants in these decisions. We expect to continue with these activities during 2013. We plan to grow our private capital business with the deployment of the private capital commitments we have already raised, formation of new co-investment ventures, including the new ventures in Europe and Japan, and raising incremental capital for our existing co-investment ventures. Improve the Utilization of Our Low Yielding Assets We plan to increase the value of our low yielding assets by stabilizing our operating portfolio to 95% leased, completing the build-out and lease-up of our development projects as well as monetizing our land through development or sale to third parties. Build the most effective and efficient organization in the REIT industry and become the employer of choice among top professionals interested in real estate as a career We realized more than $115 million of cost synergies on an annualized basis, compared to the combined expenses of AMB and ProLogis on a pre-Merger basis. These synergies included gross general and administrative savings, reduced global line of credit facility fees and lower amortization of non real estate assets. We will continue to look for and achieve additional savings opportunities. In addition, we implemented a new enterprise wide system that includes a property management/billing system (implemented in April 2012), a human resources system (implemented in July 2012), a general ledger and accounting system and a data warehouse (implemented in January 2013). In connection with this implementation, we are striving to utilize the most effective global business processes with the enhanced system functionality, and have also implemented several analytical tools to further empower and assist our regional and local teams. In early 2012, we implemented two new compensation plans that we believe will better align employees’ compensation to our company performance. We believe these efforts and others will help us with the attainment of this objective. See “Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of our 2012 results and progress attaining the objectives outlined above. Code of Ethics and Business Conduct We maintain a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct applicable to our Board of Directors (“Board”) and all of our officers and employees, including the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer, or persons performing similar functions. A copy of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is available on our website, www.prologis.com. In addition to being accessible through our website, copies of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct can be obtained, free of charge, upon written request to Investor Relations, Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111. Any amendments to or waivers of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct that apply to the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer, or the principal accounting officer, or persons performing similar functions, and that relate to any matter enumerated in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K, will be disclosed on our website. Environmental Matters We are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition. Either the previous owners or we subjected a majority of the properties we have acquired, including land, to environmental reviews. While 7 Table of Contents some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling, none of the environmental assessments has revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and “Item 1A. Risk Factors”. Insurance Coverage We carry insurance coverage on our properties. We determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and our business operations in specific markets. Such coverage includes property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from such perils as fire, additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy, namely windstorm, flood, earthquake and terrorism; commercial general liability insurance; and environmental insurance. Insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance, self insurance and through a wholly-owned captive insurance entity. We believe that our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties, business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured. However, an uninsured loss could result in loss of capital investment and anticipated revenues and earnings. See further discussion in “Item 1A. Risk Factors”. ITEM 1A. Risk Factors Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, distributable cash flow and value of our securities. These risks include, among others: General Disruptions in the Global Capital and Credit Markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Global market and economic conditions have been challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower growth in most major economies during the last few years. Although signs of recovery are emerging, there are continued concerns about the systemic impact of inflation, the availability and cost of credit, a lagging real estate market and geopolitical issues that contribute to increased market volatility and uncertain expectations for the global economy. To the extent there is turmoil in the financial markets, it has the potential to materially affect the value of our properties and investments in our unconsolidated entities, the availability or the terms of financing that we and our unconsolidated entities have or may anticipate utilizing, our ability and that of our unconsolidated entities to make principal and interest payments on, or refinance any outstanding debt when due and may impact the ability of our customers to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments under existing leases. The market volatility over the last several years has made the valuation of our properties and those of our unconsolidated entities more difficult. There may be significant uncertainty in the valuation, or in the stability of the value, of our properties and those we invest in through unconsolidated entities, that could result in a decrease in the value of our properties and our investments in unconsolidated entities. As a result, we may not be able to recover the current carrying amount of our investments in real estate properties, including our unconsolidated entities, which may require us to recognize an impairment charge in earnings where it is known in addition to the charges we previously recognized. Any additional, continued or recurring disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities. As a global company, we are subject to social, political and economic risks of doing business in many countries. We conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the United States. During 2012, we generated approximately 41.8% or $838.6 million of our revenue from operations outside the United States. Circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow include, but are not limited to, the following factors: • difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations in certain regions; • differing employment practices and labor issues; • local businesses and cultural factors that differ from our usual standards and practices; • volatility in currencies; • currency restrictions, which may prevent the transfer of capital and profits to the United States; • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and other laws; • potentially adverse tax consequences; • the responsibility of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws, e.g., with respect to corrupt practices, employment and licensing; 8 Table of Contents • the impact of regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability; • political instability, uncertainty over property rights, civil unrest, drug trafficking, political activism or the continuation or escalation of terrorist or gang activities (particularly with respect to our operations in Mexico); • foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in countries; and • access to capital may be more restricted, or unavailable on favorable terms or at all in certain locations. Our global growth also subjects us to certain risks, including risks associated with funding increasing headcount, integrating new offices, and establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate the operations of new offices and to monitor compliance with regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act and similar laws. Although we have committed substantial resources to expand our global platform, if we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or to adequately manage operational fluctuations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In addition, our international operations and, specifically, the ability of our non-United States subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries, including transfers of cash to pay interest and principal on our debt, may be affected by currency exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences, among other things. The depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. We have pursued, and intend to continue to pursue, growth opportunities in international markets where the U.S. dollar is not the functional currency. At December 31, 2012, approximately 40.6% or $11.1 billion of our total assets are invested in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound sterling, euro and Japanese yen. As a result, we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. A significant change in the value of the foreign currency of one or more countries where we have a significant investment may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, debt covenant ratios, results of operations and cash flow. Although we attempt to mitigate adverse effects by borrowing under debt agreements denominated in foreign currencies and using derivative contracts, there can be no assurance that those attempts to mitigate foreign currency risk will be successful. Hedging arrangements involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements and the risk of fluctuation in the relative value of the foreign currency. The funds required to settle such arrangements could be significant depending on the stability and movement of foreign currency. The failure to hedge effectively against exchange rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of assets, which may reduce economic returns to investors. Real estate investments are not as liquid as certain other types of investments and this lack of liquidity may limit our ability to react promptly to changes in economic or other conditions. In addition, significant expenditures associated with real estate investments, such as secured mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investments. Like other companies qualifying as REITs under the Internal Revenue Code, we are only able to hold property for sale in the ordinary course of business through taxable REIT subsidiaries in order to not incur punitive taxation on any tax gain from the sale of such property. While we may dispose of certain properties that have been held for investment in order to generate liquidity, if we do not satisfy certain safe harbors or we believe there is too much risk of incurring the punitive tax on any tax gain from the sale, we may not pursue such sales. In the event that we do not have sufficient cash available to us through our operations or available credit facilities to continue operating our business as usual, we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity. Such alternatives may include, without limitation, divesting ourselves of properties, whether or not they otherwise meet our strategic objectives to keep in the long term, at less than optimal terms, incurring debt, entering into leases with our customers at lower rental rates or less than optimal terms or entering into lease renewals with our existing customers without an increase in rental rates at turnover. There can be no assurance, however, that such alternative ways to increase our liquidity will be available to us. Additionally, taking such measures to increase our liquidity may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, our ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities. Risks Related to our Business General economic conditions and other events or occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated, may impact financial results. We are exposed to general economic conditions, local, regional, national and international economic conditions and other events and occurrences that affect the markets in which we own properties. Our operating performance is further impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties. 9 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2012, approximately 25.1% of our consolidated operating properties or $5.7 billion (based on investment before depreciation) are located in California, which represented 20.5% of the aggregate square footage of our operating properties and 23.1% of our annualized base rent. Our revenue from, and the value of, our properties located in California may be affected by local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties) and the local economic climate. Business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics and other factors may adversely impact California’s economic climate. Because of the number of properties we have located in California, a downturn in California’s economy or real estate conditions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities. In addition to California, we also have significant holdings (defined as more than 3% of total investment before depreciation) in operating properties in certain global and regional markets located in Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, France, Japan, Mexico, New Jersey/New York City, South Florida and the United Kingdom. Our operating performance could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any of the markets in which we have a concentration of properties. Conditions such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for distribution space, among other factors, may impact operating conditions. Any material oversupply of distribution space or material reduction in demand for distribution space could adversely affect our results of operations, distributable cash flow and the value of our securities. In addition, the unconsolidated entities in which we invest have concentrations of properties in the same markets mentioned above, as well as in markets in Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and Seattle are subject to the economic conditions in those markets. A number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to earthquake activity. United States properties located in active seismic areas include properties in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and Seattle. International properties located in active seismic areas include Japan and Mexico. We generally carry earthquake insurance on our properties located in areas historically subject to seismic activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable. We evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants and in some specific instances have elected to self insure our earthquake exposure based on this analysis. We have elected not to carry earthquake insurance for wholly owned assets in Japan based on this analysis. Further, a number of our properties are located in areas that are known to be subject to hurricane and/or flood risk. We carry hurricane and flood hazard insurance on all of our properties located in areas historically subject to such activity, subject to coverage limitations and deductibles if we believe it is commercially reasonable. We evaluate our insurance coverage annually in light of current industry practice through an analysis prepared by outside consultants. Our insurance coverage does not include all potential losses. We and our unconsolidated entities currently carry insurance coverage including property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from certain perils such as fire and additional perils as covered under an extended coverage policy, namely windstorm, flood, earthquake and terrorism; commercial general liability insurance; and environmental insurance, as appropriate for the markets where each of our properties and business operations are located. The insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties, business activities and markets. We believe our properties and the properties of our unconsolidated entities are adequately insured. However, there are certain losses, including losses from floods, earthquakes, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots, that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, we could experience a significant loss of capital invested and future revenues in these properties and could potentially remain obligated under any recourse debt associated with the property. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that the insurance companies will be able to continue to offer products with sufficient coverage at commercially reasonable rates. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds insured limits with respect to one or more of our properties or if the insurance companies fail to meet their coverage commitments to us in the event of an insured loss, then we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from those properties and, if there is recourse debt, then we would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the properties. Any such losses or higher insurance costs could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities. Investments in real estate properties are subject to risks that could adversely affect our business. Investments in real estate properties are subject to varying degrees of risk. While we seek to minimize these risks through geographic diversification of our portfolio, market research and our property management capabilities, these risks cannot be eliminated. Some of the factors that may affect real estate values include: • local conditions, such as an oversupply of distribution space or a reduction in demand for distribution space in an area; • the attractiveness of our properties to potential customers; • competition from other available properties; 10 Table of Contents • increasing costs of rehabilitating, repositioning, renovating and making improvements to our properties; • our ability to provide adequate maintenance of, and insurance on, our properties; • our ability to control rents and variable operating costs; • governmental regulations, including zoning, usage and tax laws and changes in these laws; and • potential liability under, and changes in, environmental, zoning and other laws. Our investments are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector and our business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector. Our investments in real estate assets are primarily concentrated in the industrial distribution sector. This concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities were more diversified. Our operating results and distributable cash flow will depend on the continued generation of lease revenues from customers and we may be unable to lease vacant space or renew leases or re-lease space on favorable terms as leases expire. Our operating results and distributable cash flow would be adversely affected if a significant number of our customers were unable to meet their lease obligations. We are also subject to the risk that, upon the expiration of leases for space located in our properties, leases may not be renewed by existing customers, the space may not be re-leased to new customers or the terms of renewal or re-leasing (including the cost of required renovations or concessions to customers) may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. Our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers, we may lose potential customers, and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to retain customers when our customers’ leases expire. In the event of default by a significant number of customers, we may experience delays and incur substantial costs in enforcing our rights as landlord, and may be unable to re-lease spaces. A customer may experience a downturn in its business, which may cause the loss of the customer or may weaken its financial condition, resulting in the customer’s failure to make rental payments when due or requiring a restructuring that might reduce cash flow from the lease. In addition, a customer may seek the protection of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws, which could result in the rejection and termination of such customer’s lease and thereby cause a reduction in our available cash flow. If we decide to contribute or sell properties to an unconsolidated entity or third parties to generate proceeds, we may not be successful. We may contribute or sell properties to certain of our unconsolidated entities or third parties on a case-by-case basis. Our ability to sell properties on advantageous terms is affected by competition from other owners of properties that are trying to dispose of their properties; market conditions, including the capitalization rates applicable to our properties; and other factors beyond our control. If our competitors sell assets similar to assets we intend to divest in the same markets and/or at valuations below our valuations for comparable assets, we may be unable to divest our assets at favorable pricing or on favorable terms or at all. The unconsolidated entity or third parties who might acquire our properties may need to have access to debt and equity capital, in the private and public markets, in order to acquire properties from us. Should they have limited or no access to capital on favorable terms, then dispositions could be delayed. If we are unable to generate proceeds through property sales we may have to delay our deleveraging plans, which may result in adverse effects on our liquidity, distributable cash flow, debt covenant ratio, and the market price of our securities. We may acquire properties, which involves risks that could adversely affect our operating results and the value of our securities. We may acquire industrial properties. The acquisition of properties involves risks, including the risk that the acquired property will not perform as anticipated and that any actual costs for rehabilitation, repositioning, renovation and improvements identified in the pre-acquisition due diligence process will exceed estimates. When we acquire properties, we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with local government and permitting procedures. Additionally, there is, and it is expected there will continue to be, significant competition for properties that meet our investment criteria as well as risks associated with obtaining financing for acquisition activities. Our real estate development strategies may not be successful. Our real estate development strategy is focused on monetizing land in the future through sales to third parties, development of industrial properties to hold for long-term investment or contribution or sale to an unconsolidated entity, depending on market conditions, our liquidity needs and other factors. We may expand investment in our development, renovation and redevelopment business and we will complete the build-out and leasing of our development platform. We may also develop, renovate and redevelop properties within existing or newly formed development co-investment ventures. The real estate development, renovation and redevelopment business involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities, which include the following risks: • we may not be able to obtain financing for development projects on favorable terms or at all; • we may not be able to obtain, or may experience delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations; 11 Table of Contents • we may seek to sell certain land parcels and not be able to find a third party to acquire such land or the sales price will not allow us to recover our investment, resulting in additional impairment charges; • development opportunities that we explore may be abandoned and the related investment impaired; • the properties may perform below anticipated levels, producing cash flow below budgeted amounts; • we may not be able to lease properties on favorable terms or at all; • construction costs, total investment amounts and our share of remaining funding may exceed our estimates and projects may not be completed, delivered or stabilized as planned; • we may not be able to attract third party investment in new development co-investment ventures or sufficient customer demand for our product; • we may not be able to capture the anticipated enhanced value created by our redevelopment projects on expected timetables or at all; • we may experience delays (temporary or permanent) if there is public or government opposition to our activities; and • substantial renovation, new development and redevelopment activities, regardless of their ultimate success, typically require a significant amount of management’s time and attention, diverting their attention from our day-to-day operations. We are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flow. Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner, developer or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of removal or remediation of such substances could be substantial. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such hazardous substances. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages based on personal injury, property damage or other costs, including investigation and clean-up costs, resulting from the environmental contamination. Environmental laws in some countries, including the United States, also require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos. Some of our properties are known to contain asbestos-containing building materials. In addition, some of our properties are leased or have been leased, in part, to owners and operators of businesses that use, store or otherwise handle petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, creating a potential for the release of such hazardous or toxic substances. Further, certain of our properties are on, adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or upon which others have engaged, are engaged or may engage in activities that may release such hazardous or toxic substances. From time to time, we may acquire properties, or interests in properties, with known adverse environmental conditions where we believe that the environmental liabilities associated with these conditions are quantifiable and that the acquisition will yield a superior risk-adjusted return. In connection with certain divested properties, we have agreed to remain responsible for, and to bear the cost of, remediating or monitoring certain environmental conditions on the properties. We cannot give any assurance that other such conditions do not exist or may not arise in the future. The presence of such substances on our real estate properties could adversely affect our ability to lease, develop or sell such properties or to borrow using such properties as collateral and may have an adverse effect on our distributable cash flow. We are subject to risks and liabilities in connection with forming co-investment ventures, investing in new or existing co-investment ventures, attracting third party investment and investing in and managing properties through co-investment ventures. As of December 31, 2012, we had an investment in real estate containing approximately 214.5 million square feet held through unconsolidated entities. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of available funds that we may invest in unconsolidated entities, and we may and currently intend to develop and acquire properties through co-investment ventures and investments in other entities when warranted by the circumstances. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to form new co-investment ventures, attract third party investment or make additional investments in new or existing co-investment ventures, successfully develop or acquire properties through unconsolidated entities, or realize value from such unconsolidated entities. Our inability to do so may have an adverse effect on our growth, our earnings and the market price of our securities. 12 Table of Contents Our partners in our unconsolidated investments may share certain approval rights over major decisions and some partners may manage the properties in the unconsolidated entities. Our unconsolidated investments involve certain risks, including: • if our partners fail to fund their share of any required capital contributions, then we may choose to contribute such capital; • our partners might have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals that would affect our ability to operate the property; • the venture or other governing agreements often restrict the transfer of an interest in the co-investment venture or may otherwise restrict our ability to sell the interest when we desire or on advantageous terms; • our relationships with our partners are generally contractual in nature and may be terminated or dissolved under the terms of the agreements, and in such event, we may not continue to manage or invest in the assets underlying such relationships resulting in reduced fee revenue or causing a need to purchase such interest to continue ownership; and • disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business and result in subjecting the properties owned by the applicable co-investment venture to additional risk. We generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over our unconsolidated entities to permit us to achieve our business objectives; however, we may not be able to do so. We have formed publicly traded investment vehicles, like our publicly traded REIT in Japan, for which we serve as sponsor and/or manager. We have contributed, and may continue to contribute, assets into such vehicles. As with any of our publicly traded entities or funds, there is a risk that we may not be able to continue to manage such entities and their assets in the event that our managerial relationship is terminated. The occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders and the market price of our securities. Contingent or unknown liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition. We have acquired and may in the future acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of any of these entities or properties, then we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow. Contingent or unknown liabilities with respect to entities or properties acquired might include: • liabilities for environmental conditions; • losses in excess of our insured coverage; • accrued but unpaid liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; • tax, legal and regulatory liabilities; and • claims for indemnification by the general partners, officers and directors and others indemnified by the former owners of our properties. Risks Related to Financing and Capital We face risks associated with the use of debt to fund our business activities, including refinancing and interest rate risks, and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to make required payments on our debt or are unable to refinance our debt. We are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. There can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness, that such refinancing would be on terms as favorable as the terms of the maturing indebtedness, or that we will be able to otherwise obtain funds by selling assets or raising equity to make required payments on maturing indebtedness. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected and, if the maturing debt is secured, the lender may foreclose on the property securing such indebtedness. Our Global Senior Credit Agreement, Japanese yen-based credit agreement and certain other debt bears interest at variable rates. Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these agreements. From time to time, we may enter into interest rate swap or cap agreements. Such hedging arrangements involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements. The funds required to settle any swap breakage arrangements, if any, could be significant depending on the size of underlying financing and the applicable interest rates at the time of breakage. The failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. In addition, our unconsolidated entities may be unable to refinance indebtedness or meet payment obligations, which may impact our distributable cash flow and our financial condition and/or we may be required to recognize impairment charges of our investments. 13 Table of Contents Covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and breaches of these covenants could adversely affect our financial condition. The terms of our various credit agreements, including our Global Senior Credit Agreement and Japanese yen-based credit agreement, the indentures under which our senior notes are issued and other note agreements, require us to comply with a number of customary financial covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage, leverage ratios, fixed charge ratios and other operating covenants including maintaining insurance coverage. These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness. If we default under the covenant provisions and are unable to cure the default, refinance the indebtedness or meet payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition could be adversely affected. Adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively affect our financing activity. The credit ratings of our senior unsecured notes and preferred stock are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analyses of us. Our credit ratings can affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms and pricing of any debt we may incur. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings, and in the event our credit ratings are downgraded, we would likely incur higher borrowing costs and may encounter difficulty in obtaining additional financing. Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings may trigger additional payments or other negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments. Adverse changes in our credit ratings could negatively impact our refinancing and other capital market activities, our ability to manage debt maturities, our future growth, our financial condition, the market price of our securities, and our development and acquisition activity. We are dependent on external sources of capital. In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain) and we may be subject to tax to the extent our income is not fully distributed. While historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders, we may choose to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, our own stock. For distributions with respect to taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2012, and in some cases declared as late as December 31, 2013, the REIT can satisfy up to 90% of the distribution requirements discussed above through the distribution of shares of our stock if certain conditions are met. Assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs, including acquisition and development activities, from cash retained from operations and may have to rely on third-party sources of capital. Further, in order to maintain our REIT status and not have to pay federal income and excise taxes, we may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the REIT distribution requirements even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. These short-term borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. Our ability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms or at all is dependent upon a number of factors, including general market conditions, the market’s perception of our growth potential, our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our securities. Our stockholders may experience dilution if we issue additional common stock. Any additional future issuance of common stock will reduce the percentage of our common stock owned by investors. In most circumstances, stockholders will not be entitled to vote on whether or not we issue additional common stock. In addition, depending on the terms and pricing of an additional offering of our common stock and the value of the properties, our stockholders may experience dilution in both book value and fair value of their common stock. Federal Income Tax Risks Our failure to qualify as a REIT would have serious adverse consequences. We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 1997. We believe we have operated so as to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, it is possible that we are organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. Qualification as a REIT requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual and others on a quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex sections of the Internal Revenue Code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. For example, in order to qualify as a REIT, Prologis must derive at least 95% of its gross income in any year from qualifying sources. In addition, we must pay dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding capital gains) and must satisfy specified asset tests on a quarterly basis. The provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury regulations regarding qualification as a REIT are more complicated in our case because we hold assets through the Operating Partnership. 14 Table of Contents If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on taxable income at regular corporate rates. Unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we lost the qualification. If we lost our REIT status, our net earnings would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved. Furthermore, we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary REITs which elected to be taxed as REITs under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. Provided that each subsidiary REIT qualifies as a REIT, our interest in such subsidiary REIT will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset tests, and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary REIT will generally be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. To qualify as a REIT, the subsidiary REIT must independently satisfy all of the REIT qualification requirements. If such subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, and certain relief provisions did not apply, it would be treated as a regular taxable corporation and its income would be subject to United States federal income tax. In addition, a failure of the subsidiary REIT to qualify as a REIT would have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify as a REIT. Certain property transfers may generate prohibited transaction income, resulting in a penalty tax on gain attributable to the transaction. From time to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties, including by contributing properties to our co-investment ventures. Under the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting from transfers of properties we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100% penalty tax. We do not believe that our transfers or disposals of property or our contributions of properties into our co-investment ventures are prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Code may contend that certain transfers or dispositions of properties by us or contributions of properties into our co-investment ventures are prohibited transactions. While we believe that the Internal Revenue Code would not prevail in any such dispute, if the Internal Revenue Code were to argue successfully that a transfer, disposition, or contribution of property constituted a prohibited transaction, we would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to us from the prohibited transaction. In addition, income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a REIT. Legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us. In recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made to the federal income tax taws applicable to investments in REITs and similar entities. Additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue to occur in the future, and may impact our taxation or that of our stockholders. Other Risks Risks Associated with our Dependence on Key Personnel. We depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. From time to time, our personnel and their roles may change. In connection with the completion of the Merger, there were changes to our personnel and their roles. While we believe that we have retained our key talent and have found suitable employees to meet our personnel needs, the loss of key personnel, any change in their roles, or the limitation of their availability could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions and payments to security holders and the market price of our securities. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain our executive officers, or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees become more expensive, our performance and competitive position could be materially adversely affected. Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar regulations could result in substantial costs. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, places of public accommodation must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants. If we are required to make unanticipated expenditures to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, including removing access barriers, then our cash flow and the amounts available to make distributions and payments to our security holders may be adversely affected. Our properties are also subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life-safety requirements. We could incur fines or private damage awards if we fail to comply with these requirements. While we believe that our properties are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us that will affect our cash flow and results of operations. We are subject to governmental regulations and actions that affect operating results and financial condition. Many laws, including tax laws, and governmental regulations apply to us, our unconsolidated entities and our properties. Changes in these laws and governmental regulations, or their interpretation by agencies or the courts, could occur, which might affect our ability to conduct business. Our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting. The design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures 15 Table of Contents and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Deficiencies, including any material weakness, in our internal control over financial reporting that may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in the price of our securities, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. We are exposed to the potential impacts of future climate change and climate change related risks. We consider that we are exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate. Our distribution facilities may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events, such as severe storms and/or floods. If the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change, our exposure to these events could increase. We do not currently consider ourselves to be exposed to regulatory risks related to climate change, as our operations do not emit a significant amount of greenhouse gases. However, we may be adversely impacted as a real estate developer in the future by potential impacts to the supply chain and/or stricter energy efficiency standards for buildings. ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. ITEM 2. Properties We are invested in real estate properties that are primarily generic industrial properties. In Japan, our industrial properties are generally multi-level centers, which is common in Japan due to the high cost and limited availability of land. Our properties are typically used for distribution, storage, packaging, assembly and light manufacturing of consumer and industrial products. Based on the square footage of the operating properties included in our Real Estate Operations segment at December 31, 2012 (and discussed below), all of our properties are industrial properties; consisting of 92.8% used for bulk distribution, 4.7% used for light manufacturing and assembly, 1.0% used for flex industrial, 0.9% used for on-tarmac and 0.6% used for other purposes. Geographic Distribution Our investment strategy focuses on providing distribution and logistics space to customers whose businesses are tied to global trade and depend on the efficient movement of goods through the global supply chain. Our properties are primarily located in two main market types, global markets and regional markets. Global markets account for 84.7% of our consolidated operating properties (based on investment balance) and comprise approximately 30 of the largest and most liquid markets tied to global trade. These markets feature large population centers with high per-capita consumption rates and close proximity to airports, seaports and ground transportation systems. Regional markets account for 11.6% of our consolidated operating properties. Similar to global markets, regional markets benefit from large population centers but typically are not as tied to the global supply chain and are often less supply constrained. 16 Table of Contents The information in the following tables is as of December 31, 2012 for our consolidated operating properties, properties in our development portfolio and land, including 157 buildings owned by entities we consolidate but of which we own less than 100%. All of these assets are included in our Real Estate Operations segment. This includes our portfolio of operating properties we developed or are currently developing. No individual property or group of properties operating as a single business unit amounted to 10% or more of our consolidated total assets at December 31, 2012 or generated income equal to 10% or more of our consolidated gross revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012. These tables do not include properties that are owned by unconsolidated entities.

For purposes of this table, the total principal balance of a debt issuance that is secured by a pool of properties is allocated among the properties in the pool based on each property’s investment balance. In addition to the amounts reflected here, we also have a $44.3 million of encumbrances related to other real estate properties not included in the Real Estate Operations segment. See Schedule III — Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for additional identification of the properties pledged. (3) Represents the total expected investment when the property under development is completed and leased. This includes the cost of land, development and leasing costs. (4) Included in other investments are: (i) certain non-industrial real estate; (ii) our corporate office buildings; (iii) land parcels that are ground leased to third parties; (iv) certain infrastructure costs related to projects we are developing on behalf of others; (v) restricted funds that are held in escrow pending the completion of tax-deferred exchange transactions involving operating properties; (vi) costs related to future development projects, including purchase options on land; and (vii) earnest money deposits associated with potential acquisitions. In December 2012 and February 2013, we announced the formation of two new co-investment ventures in Europe and Japan, respectively. We have 207 operating properties aggregating approximately $5.0 billion that we have contributed or expect to contribute these two entities in 2013. See further discussion below under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Unconsolidated Co-Investment Ventures At December 31, 2012, we had investments in real estate properties, primarily industrial properties that we also manage, through our equity investments in unconsolidated co-investment ventures. These investments include 1,163 properties aggregating 208.8 million square feet and a total gross book value of operating buildings of $17.6 billion. See further discussion in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we and our unconsolidated entities are parties to a variety of legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe that, with respect to any such matters that we are currently a party to, the ultimate disposition of any such matter will not result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.

We collect rent from our customers through long-term operating leases, including reimbursements for the majority of our property operating costs. We expect to generate long-term internal growth by increasing rents, maintaining high occupancy rates and controlling expenses. The primary driver of our revenue growth will be rolling in-place leases to current market rents coupled with increasing market rents. We believe our active portfolio management, combined with the skills of our property, leasing, maintenance, capital, energy, sustainability and risk management teams, will allow us to maximize rental revenues across our portfolio. A significant amount of our rental revenues, NOI and cash flows are generated in the U.S. Development. We develop properties to meet our customers’ needs, deepen our market presence and refresh our portfolio quality. We believe we have a competitive advantage due to (i) the strategic locations of our land bank; (ii) the development expertise of our local teams; and (iii) the depth of our customer relationships. Successful development and redevelopment efforts provide significant earnings growth as projects lease up and generate income and increase the net asset value of our Real Estate Operations segment. Based on our current estimates, our consolidated land bank, excluding land we have under option contracts, has the potential to support the development of $7.7 billion of TEI of new logistics space. Generally, we develop properties in the U.S. for long-term hold and outside the U.S. for contribution to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. Strategic Capital Real estate is a capital-intensive business that requires new capital to grow. Our strategic capital business gives us access to third-party capital, both private and public, allowing us to diversify our sources of capital and providing us with a broad range of options to fund our growth, while reducing our exposure to foreign currency movements for investments outside of the U.S. We partner with some of the world’s largest institutional investors to grow our business and provide incremental revenues, with a focus on long-term and open-ended ventures. We also access alternative sources of equity through two publicly traded vehicles: Nippon Prologis REIT, Inc. in Japan and FIBRA Prologis in Mexico. We align our interests with those of our partners by holding significant ownership interests in all of our unconsolidated co-investment ventures (ranging from 15% to 50%). This segment produces stable, long-term cash flows and generally contributes 10% to 15% of our consolidated revenues, earnings and FFO. We generate strategic capital revenues or fees from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, principally through asset and property management services. Substantially all of these revenues and fees are earned from long-term and open-ended ventures. We earn additional revenues by providing leasing, acquisition, construction, development, financing, legal and disposition services. In certain ventures, we also have the ability to earn revenues through incentive fees (“promotes” or “promote revenues”) periodically during the life of a venture or upon liquidation. We plan to profitably grow this business by increasing our assets under management in existing or new ventures. Most of the strategic capital revenues are generated outside the U.S. NOI in this segment is calculated directly from our Consolidated Financial Statements as Strategic Capital Revenues less Strategic Capital Expenses and excludes property-related NOI. FUTURE GROWTH We believe the quality and scale of our global portfolio, the expertise of our team, the depth of our customer relationships and the strength of our balance sheet give us unique competitive advantages to grow revenues, NOI, earnings, FFO and cash flows. 5 • Rent Growth. We expect market rents to continue to grow over the next few years, driven by demand for the location and quality of our properties. Due to strong market rent growth over the last several years, our in-place leases have considerable upside potential. We estimate that our leases are more than 15% below current market rent on the basis of our weighted average ownership at December 31, 2018. Therefore, even if market rents remain flat, a lease renewal will translate into increased future rental income, on a consolidated basis or through the earnings we recognize from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures based on our ownership. We have experienced positive rent change on rollover (comparing the net effective rent of the new lease to the prior lease for the same space) every quarter since 2013. We expect this trend to continue for several more years due to our current in-place rents being below market as well as increasing market rents. • Value Creation from Development. A successful development and redevelopment program involves maintaining control of well-located and entitled land. We believe the carrying value of our land bank is below its current fair value. Due to the strategic nature of our land bank and development expertise of our teams, we expect to realize future value creation as we build out the land bank. We measure the estimated development value as the margin above our anticipated cost to develop. We calculate the margin using estimated yield and capitalization rates from our underwriting models. As properties under development stabilize, we expect to realize the value creation principally through contributions to the unconsolidated co-investment ventures and increases in the NOI of our operating portfolio. • Economies of Scale from Growth. In 2018, we grew our consolidated real estate assets by 67 million square feet (or approximately 20%), primarily through the DCT Transaction, while lowering our general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses as a percentage of our average consolidated real estate investment. We believe we can continue to grow NOI and strategic capital revenues organically and through accretive acquisition and development, while strengthening our balance sheet and minimizing G&A expense growth. Competition Real estate ownership is generally fragmented, and we therefore face competition from many owners and operators. Competitively priced logistics space could impact our occupancy rates and have an adverse effect on how much rent we can charge, which in turn could affect our operating results. We may face competition regarding our capital deployment activities, including local, regional and national operators or developers. We also face competition from investment managers for institutional capital within our strategic capital business. Despite the competition we may face, our strategic focus over the years has given us distinct competitive advantages. These competitive advantages encompass the following: • a portfolio of properties strategically located in markets characterized by large population densities and growing consumption, typically near large labor pools and extensive transportation infrastructure; • the development of logistics facilities with sustainable design features that will continue to meet customer needs for high-quality buildings that can enable them to run their operations efficiently; • established relationships with customers served by our experienced and responsive local and regional teams; • the ability to leverage our organizational scale and structure to provide a single point of contact for our focus customers through our in-house global customer solutions team; • an investment across the portfolio in environmental stewardship, social responsibility and governance (“ESG”) practices that enhance asset value while improving sustainability performance; • proven property management and leasing expertise; • relationships and track record with current and prospective investors in our strategic capital business; • a strategically located land bank; • local teams with development expertise; and • a strong balance sheet and credit ratings, coupled with significant liquidity. Customers Our broad customer base represents a spectrum of international, national, regional and local logistics users. At December 31, 2018, in our Real Estate Operations segment representing our consolidated properties, we had more than 3,000 customers occupying 356 million square feet of logistics operating properties. 6 The following table details our top 25 customers for our consolidated real estate properties at December 31, 2018 (square feet in millions): Top Customers % of NER (1) Total Occupied Square Feet 1.

Amounts derived in a currency other than the U.S. dollar have been translated using the average rate from the previous twelve months. In our Strategic Capital segment, we view our partners and investors as our customers. At December 31, 2018, in our co-investment ventures, we partnered with approximately 120 investors, several of which invest in multiple ventures. Employees The following table summarizes our total number of employees at December 31, 2018: Regions U.S. (1) 878 Other Americas 136 Europe 375 Asia 228 Total 1,617 (1) This includes employees who were based in the U.S. but also support other regions. We allocate the employee costs to provide property management and leasing functions to our Real Estate Operations and Strategic Capital segments based on the square footage of the respective portfolios. The employee costs to perform only Strategic Capital functions are allocated directly to that segment. We believe we have good relationships with our employees. Prologis employees are not organized under collective bargaining agreements, other than in Brazil, although some employees in Europe are represented by statutory Works Councils and as such, benefit from applicable labor agreements. CODE OF ETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT We maintain a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct applicable to our board of directors (the “Board”) and all of our officers and employees, including the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer, and other people 7 performing similar functions. A copy of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is available on our website, www.prologis.com. In addition to being accessible through our website, copies of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct can be obtained, free of charge, upon written request to Investor Relations, Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111. Any amendments to or waivers of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct that apply to the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer, the principal accounting officer, or other people performing similar functions, and that relate to any matter enumerated in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K, will be disclosed on our website. ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP, SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND GOVERNANCE The principles of ESG are a natural fit in our business strategy. ESG creates value for our company by strengthening our relationships with our customers, investors, employees and the communities in which we do business — delivering a strategic business advantage while positively impacting the environment. We invest in sustainable design features and practices that result in cost-savings and operational efficiency for our customers and reduce energy and water consumption, as well as decrease greenhouse gas emissions across our portfolio and corporate operations. We are committed to social responsibility and strengthening relationships important to our business through customer partnerships, investor outreach, community involvement, labor solutions and inclusion and diversity initiatives, as well as a focus on our and our customers’ employees through health and wellness programs and building design. Through our community workforce initiative, for example, we partner with local community organizations to provide logistics training and help our customers with their labor pain points, while benefitting local economies and providing new career opportunities. Our strong governance and oversight ensures the resilience of our business, creating a culture of uncompromising integrity through our Board independence and diversity, open communication with our stockholders and a risk management framework that supports our investment and process decisions. Our approach is reinforced by our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, as described above. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS We are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition. Either the previous owners or we have conducted environmental reviews on a majority of the properties we have acquired, including land. While some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling, none of the environmental assessments have revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

1045609,PLD,"Prologis, Inc.",2021,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Throughout this discussion, we reflect amounts in U.S. dollars, our reporting currency. Included in these amounts are consolidated and unconsolidated investments denominated in foreign currencies, principally the British pound sterling, euro and Japanese yen that are impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates when translated to U.S. dollars. We mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by investing outside the U.S. through co-investment ventures, borrowing in the functional currency of our subsidiaries and utilizing derivative financial instruments. OPERATING SEGMENTS Our business comprises two operating segments: Real Estate Operations and Strategic Capital. Below is information summarizing consolidated activity within our segments over the last three years (in millions): (1) NOI from Real Estate Operations is calculated directly from our Consolidated Financial Statements as Rental Revenues and Development Management and Other Revenues less Rental Expenses and Other Expenses. (2) A developed property moves into the operating portfolio when it meets our definition of stabilization, which is the earlier of one year after completion or 90% occupancy. Amounts represent our total expected investment (“TEI”), which includes the estimated cost of development, land, construction and leasing costs. Real Estate Operations Rental. Rental operations comprise the largest component of our operating segments and generally contribute 85% to 90% of our consolidated revenues, earnings and funds from operations (“FFO”). We collect rent from our customers through operating leases, including reimbursements for the majority of our property operating costs. We expect to generate internal growth by increasing rents, maintaining high occupancy rates and controlling expenses. The primary driver of our revenue growth will be rolling in-place leases to current market rents as leases expire. We believe our active portfolio management, combined with the skills of our property, leasing, maintenance, capital, energy, sustainability and risk management teams allow us to maximize NOI across our portfolio. A majority of our consolidated rental revenue, NOI and cash flows are generated in the U.S. Development. Given the scarcity of modern logistics facilities in our target markets, our development business provides us the opportunity to build what our customers need. We develop properties to meet these needs, deepen our market presence and maintain a modern portfolio. We believe we have a competitive advantage due to (i) the strategic locations of our land bank and redevelopment sites; (ii) the development expertise of our local teams; and (iii) the depth of our customer relationships. Successful development and redevelopment efforts provide significant earnings growth as projects are leased, generate income and increase the net asset value of our Real Estate Operations segment. Based on our current estimates, our consolidated land, including options, has the potential to support the development of $11.8 billion of TEI of new logistics space. In addition to our land portfolio, we have also made investments in other properties that have the potential to be redeveloped to increase value. Generally, we develop properties in the U.S. for long-term hold and outside the U.S. for contribution to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures. Strategic Capital Our strategic capital segment allows us to partner with many of the world’s largest institutional investors and capitalize our business through private equity, principally perpetual open-ended or long-term ventures. We also access capital in this segment through two publicly traded vehicles: Nippon Prologis REIT, Inc. in Japan and FIBRA Prologis in Mexico. We align our interests with our partners by holding significant ownership interests in all of our 9 unconsolidated co-investment ventures (ranging from 15% to 50%), which allows us to reduce our exposure to foreign currency movements for investments outside the U.S. 5 This segment produces stable, long-term cash flows and generally contributes 10% to 15% of our recurring consolidated revenues, earnings and FFO. We generate strategic capital revenues from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, principally through asset and property management services. We earn additional revenues by providing leasing, acquisition, construction, development and disposition services. In certain ventures, we also have the ability to earn revenues through incentive fees (“promotes” or “promote revenues”) periodically during the life of a venture or upon liquidation. We plan to profitably grow this business by increasing our assets under management in existing or new ventures. Most of the strategic capital revenues are generated outside the U.S. NOI in this segment is calculated directly from our Consolidated Financial Statements as Strategic Capital Revenues less Strategic Capital Expenses and excludes property-related NOI. FUTURE GROWTH We believe the quality and scale of our global portfolio, the expertise of our team, the depth of our customer relationships and the strength of our balance sheet give us unique competitive advantages to grow revenues, NOI, earnings, FFO and cash flows. (1) General and Administrative (“G&A”) Expenses is a line item in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Adjusted G&A expenses is calculated from our Consolidated Financial Statements as G&A Expenses and Strategic Capital Expenses, less expenses under the Prologis Promote Plan (“PPP”) and property-level management expenses for the properties owned by the ventures. • Rent Growth. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the current economic environment, we expect rents in our markets to increase due to demand for the location and quality of our properties. In addition, due to strong market rent growth over the last several years, our in-place leases have considerable upside potential. We estimate that the rental rates of our leases are 13% below current market on the basis of our weighted average ownership at December 31, 2020. Therefore, even if market rent growth is flat, a lease renewal will likely translate into increased future rental income, on a consolidated basis or through the earnings we recognize from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures based on our ownership. We have experienced positive rent change on rollover (comparing the net effective rent (“NER”) of the new lease to the prior lease for the same space) in every quarter since 2013. We expect this trend to continue for several more years due to our current in-place rents being below market. We also expect future growth in market rents to further contribute to increased rental income. • Value Creation from Development. A successful development and redevelopment program involves maintaining control of well-located and entitled land and redevelopment sites. We believe that the carrying value of our land bank is below its current fair value. Due to the strategic nature of our land bank, development expertise of our teams and strength of our customer relationships, we expect to create value as we build new properties. We measure the estimated value creation of a development project as the margin above our anticipated cost to develop. As properties under development stabilize, we expect to realize the value creation principally through contributions to the unconsolidated co-investment ventures and increases in the NOI of our operating portfolio. • Balance Sheet Strength. Through the acquisitions of Liberty and IPT and execution of several opportunistic debt refinancings at historically low rates, we further enhanced our financial position during 2020 while maintaining low leverage. At December 31, 2020, we had total available liquidity of $4.8 billion. As a result of our low leverage and available liquidity, we have significant capacity to capitalize on value-added investment opportunities that will translate into future earnings growth. • Economies of Scale from Growth. We use adjusted G&A expenses as a percentage of the O&M portfolio to measure and evaluate our overhead costs. We have scalable systems and infrastructure in place to grow both our consolidated and O&M portfolios with limited incremental G&A expense. We believe we can continue to grow NOI and strategic capital revenues organically and through accretive development and acquisition activity while further reducing G&A as a percentage of our investments in real estate. As noted in the graph above, the acquisitions of the Liberty and IPT portfolios are key examples of this effort, where we increased our investments in real estate in the O&M portfolio by over 20% in the first quarter of 2020 and had minimal increases to G&A expenses, which results in lower G&A expenses as a percentage of the investments in real estate. • Staying “Ahead of What’s Next™”. We are working on initiatives to create value beyond the real estate by enhancing our customers’ experience, utilizing our scale to streamline our procurement activities and negotiating better pricing on products and services for us and our customers, as well as delivering improvements to our business through innovation, data analytics and 6 digitization efforts. Underlying our future strategy for growth is our ongoing commitment to, and initiatives in, environmental stewardship, social responsibility and governance (“ESG”). Competition Real estate ownership is highly fragmented, and we therefore face competition from many owners and operators. Competitively priced logistics space could impact our occupancy rates and have an adverse effect on how much rent we can charge, which in turn could affect our operating results. We may face competition regarding our capital deployment activities, including local, regional and national operators or developers. We also face competition from investment managers for institutional capital within our strategic capital business. Despite the competition we may face, our strategic focus over the years has given us distinct competitive advantages, including the following: • a portfolio of properties strategically located in markets characterized by large population densities, growing consumption and high barriers to entry, typically near large labor pools and extensive transportation infrastructure, including our Last Touch® facilities; • an investment in ESG practices that enhances asset values while improving sustainability performance, including the development of logistics facilities with sustainable design features that meet customer needs for high-quality buildings; • established relationships with customers served by our experienced and responsive local and regional teams; • the ability to leverage our organizational scale and structure to provide a single point of contact for our focus customers to address their needs through our in-house global customer solutions team; • proven property management and leasing expertise; • relationships and successful track record with current and prospective investors in our strategic capital business; • a strategically located land bank and redevelopment sites; • local teams with development expertise; and • a strong balance sheet and credit ratings, coupled with significant liquidity and borrowing capacity. Customers Our broad customer base represents a spectrum of international, national, regional and local logistics users. At December 31, 2020, in our Real Estate Operations segment representing our consolidated properties, we had more than 3,400 customers occupying 446 million square feet of logistics operating properties. 7 In order to provide for a customer-centric location strategy, we have invested in properties located within infill and urban areas in our largest global markets with same day and next day access to the consumer population, these are our Last Touch® and city distribution facilities, respectively. To support these distribution facilities, we utilize multi-market facilities located at key transportation hubs on the edge of these major infill and urban areas and gateway distribution facilities that incorporate access to major sea and intermodal ports. Below are the primary categories of goods in our buildings for our consolidated real estate properties at December 31, 2020. (1) NER is calculated using the estimated total cash to be received over the term of the lease divided by the lease term to determine the average amount of cash rent payments received per year. Amounts derived in a currency other than the U.S. dollar have been translated using the average rate from the previous year. The following table details our top 25 customers for our consolidated real estate properties at December 31, 2020 (square feet in millions): Top Customers % of NER Total Occupied Square Feet 1.

At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 128 investors in our private equity ventures, several of which invest in multiple ventures. Employees We believe our employees are the most important part of our business. When attracting, developing and retaining talent, we seek individuals who hold varied experiences and viewpoints to create an inclusive and diverse culture and workplace that allows each employee to do their best work and drive our collective success. We focus on leadership development at every level of the organization. We align employees’ goals with our overall strategic direction to create a clear link between individual efforts and the long-term success of the company and then provide effective feedback on their performance towards goals to ensure their growth. We believe a commitment to our employees’ learning and development through training, educational opportunities and mentorship is critical to our ability to continue to innovate. Through performance plans, talent recognition and individual development planning, along with reward packages, we advance our talent pool and create a sustainable and long-term enterprise. For additional discussion on the impact of COVID-19 on our employees, see the Summary of 2020 section in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following table summarizes our total number of employees at December 31, 2020: Geographies U.S. (1) 1,091 Other Americas 146 Europe 458 Asia 250 Total 1,945 (1) This includes employees who were based in the U.S. but also support other geographies. We allocate the personnel costs related to providing property management and leasing functions to our Real Estate Operations and Strategic Capital segments based on the square footage of the respective portfolios. The personnel costs to perform only Strategic Capital functions are allocated directly to that segment. We believe we have good relationships with our employees. Prologis employees are not organized under collective bargaining agreements, other than in Brazil, although some employees in Europe are represented by statutory Works Councils and as such, benefit from applicable labor agreements. CODE OF ETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT We maintain a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct applicable to our board of directors (the “Board”) and all of our officers and employees, including the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer, and other people performing similar functions. A copy of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is available on our website, www.prologis.com. In addition to being accessible through our website, copies of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct can be obtained, free of charge, upon written request to Investor Relations, Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111. Any amendments to or waivers of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct that apply to the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer, the principal accounting officer, or other people performing similar functions, and that relate to any matter enumerated in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K, will be disclosed on our website. ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP, SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND GOVERNANCE (“ESG”) Our long-standing dedication to ESG creates value for our company by strengthening our relationships with our customers, investors, employees and the communities in which we do business. The principles of ESG are an important aspect of our business strategy, delivering a strategic business advantage while positively impacting the environment. We develop modern and efficient building designs with state-of-the-art technology to stay ahead of our customers’ needs while advancing structural, transportation, and energy requirements. We invest in sustainable design features and practices, such as the addition of solar panels, cool roofs, light emitting diode (“LED”) lighting, electric vehicle charging stations, waste diversion, recycling and xeriscaping, that result in cost-savings and operational efficiency for our customers and reduce energy and water consumption, as well as decrease greenhouse gas emissions across our portfolio and corporate operations. We have a comprehensive carbon strategy that includes science-based targets to address our global carbon footprint. We are committed to social responsibility and strengthening relationships important to our business through customer partnerships, investor outreach, community involvement, labor solutions, and inclusion and diversity initiatives, as well as a focus on our employees and our customers’ employees through health and wellness programs and building design. Through our community workforce initiative, for example, we are helping build a talent pipeline for our customers with an emphasis on revitalizing career pathways and creating economic opportunities in the communities where we operate. We set an ambitious goal to train 25,000 individuals by 2025 by partnering with leading public sector organizations and leveraging learning technologies to develop innovative training solutions. Our strong governance and oversight creates a culture of uncompromising integrity. Our Board independence and diversity, open communication with our stockholders and a risk management framework that supports our investment and process decisions all serve 9 to mitigate risk and preserve value for our company. The strength of our balance sheet and credit ratings, ability to stay ahead of customer needs, and engagement with our employees through ethics and anti-corruption training, along with stockholder outreach ensures the financial, operational and reputational resilience of our organization for the long-term. Our approach is reinforced by our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, as described above. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS We are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition. Either the previous owners or we have conducted environmental reviews on a majority of the properties we have acquired, including land. While some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling, none of the environmental assessments have revealed an environmental liability that we think would have a material adverse effect beyond amounts recorded as of December 31, 2020. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. GOVERNMENTAL MATTERS We are exposed to various regulatory requirements, taxes, tariffs, trade wars and laws within the countries in which we operate and unexpected changes in these items may result in unanticipated losses, adverse tax consequences and affect our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we may be impacted by the ability of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to distribute or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries due to currency exchange control regulations and transfer pricing regulations. The impact of regional or country-specific economic instability, including government shutdowns or other internal trade alliances or agreements could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors. INSURANCE COVERAGE We carry insurance coverage on our properties. We determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and our business operations in specific markets. Such coverage typically includes property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from such perils as fire, windstorm, flood, earthquake and terrorism; commercial general liability insurance; and environmental insurance. Insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance, self-insurance and a wholly-owned captive insurance entity. The costs to insure our properties are primarily covered through expense reimbursements from our customers. We believe our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties, business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors. ITEM 1A. Risk Factors Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including but not limited to, our financial position, results of operations, cash flow, ability to make distributions and payments to security holders and the market value of our securities. These risks relate to Prologis as well as our investments in consolidated and unconsolidated entities and include among others, (i) risks related to our global operations (ii) risks related to our business; (iii) risks related to financing and capital; (iv) risks related to income taxes; and (v) general risks. Risks Related to our Global Operations As a global company, we are subject to social, political and economic risks of doing business in many countries. We conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the U.S. During 2020, we generated approximately $484 million or 10.9% of our consolidated revenues from operations outside the U.S. Circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect us include, but are not limited to, the following factors: • difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations in certain geographies, including differing employment practices and labor issues; • local businesses and cultural factors that differ from our usual standards and practices; • volatility in currencies and currency restrictions, which may prevent the transfer of capital and profits to the U.S.; • challenges in establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate operations in different geographies and to monitor compliance with applicable regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) Bribery Act and other similar laws; • unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, tariffs, trade wars and laws within the countries in which we operate; • potentially adverse tax consequences; • the responsibility of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws, e.g., with respect to corrupt practices, employment and licensing; 10 • the impact of regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability, including government shutdowns, uncertainty in the U.K., or further withdrawals from the European Union or other international trade alliances or agreements; • political instability, uncertainty over property rights, civil unrest, drug trafficking, political activism or the continuation or escalation of terrorist or gang activities; • foreign ownership restrictions in operations with the respective countries; and • access to capital may be more restricted, or unavailable on favorable terms or at all in certain locations. In addition, we may be impacted by the ability of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries due to currency exchange control regulations, transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences, among other factors. Compliance or failure to comply with regulatory requirements could result in substantial costs. We are required to comply with many regulations in different countries, including (but not limited to) the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws and regulations. Our properties are also subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and state and local fire and life-safety requirements. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of governmental fines or the award of damages to private litigants. While we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us. Disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. To the extent there is turmoil in the global financial markets, this turmoil has the potential to adversely affect (i) the value of our properties; (ii) the availability or the terms of financing that we have or may anticipate utilizing; (iii) our ability to make principal and interest payments on, or refinance any outstanding debt when due; and (iv) the ability of our customers to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments under existing leases. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may also adversely affect the market price of our securities and our ability to make distributions and payments to our security holders. The depreciation in the value of the foreign currency in countries where we have a significant investment may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. We hold significant real estate investments in international markets where the U.S. dollar is not the functional currency. At December 31, 2020, approximately $8.6 billion or 15.3% of our total consolidated assets were invested in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, principally the British pound sterling, euro and Japanese yen. For the year ended December 31, 2020, $289 million or 8.9% of our total consolidated segment NOI, as disclosed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in",2023-12-30 18:35:31.686301
