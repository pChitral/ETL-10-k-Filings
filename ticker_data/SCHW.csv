316709,SCHW,SCHWAB CHARLES CORP,2014,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Management of the Company focuses on several key client activity and financial metrics in evaluating the Company’s financial position and operating performance. Management believes that earnings per common share, net revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin, and return on common stockholders’ equity provide broad indicators of the Company’s overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns within the context of a given operating environment. Expenses excluding interest as a percentage of average client assets is considered by management to be a measure of operating efficiency. Results for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 are: Growth Rate 1-Year Year Ended December 31, 2012-2013 2013 2012 2011 Client Activity Metrics: Net new client assets (1) (in billions) (70) % $ 41.6 $ 139.7 $ 145.9 Client assets (2) (in billions, at year end) 15 % $ 2,249.4 $ 1,951.6 $ 1,677.7 New brokerage accounts (3) (in thousands) 7 % 960 900 1,138 Active brokerage accounts (4) (in thousands, at year end) 3 % 9,093 8,787 8,552 Company Financial Metrics: Net revenues 11 % $ 5,435 $ 4,883 $ 4,691 Expenses excluding interest 9 % 3,730 3,433 3,299 Income before taxes on income 18 % 1,705 1,450 1,392 Taxes on income 21 % 634 522 528 Net income 15 % $ 1,071 $ 928 $ 864 Net income available to common stockholders 14 % $ 1,010 $ 883 $ 864 Earnings per common share – diluted 13 % $ .78 $ .69 $ .70 Net revenue growth from prior year 11 % 4 % 10 % Pre-tax profit margin 31.4 % 29.7 % 29.7 % Return on common stockholders’ equity (5) 11 % 11 % 12 % Expenses excluding interest as a percentage of average client assets 0.18 % 0.19 % 0.20 % (1) Net new client assets is defined as the total inflows of client cash and securities to the firm less client outflows. Management believes that this metric along with core net new assets depicts how well the Company’s products and services appeal to new and existing clients in a given operating environment. Core net new assets totaled $140.8 billion, $112.4 billion, and $82.3 billion in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. See below for items excluded from core net new assets. (2) Client assets is the market value of all client assets custodied at the Company. Management considers client assets to be indicative of the Company’s appeal in the marketplace. Additionally, fluctuations in certain components of client assets (e.g., Mutual Fund OneSource funds) directly impact asset management and administration fees. (3) New brokerage accounts include all brokerage accounts opened during the period, as well as any accounts added via acquisition. This metric measures the Company’s effectiveness in attracting new clients and building stronger relationships with existing clients. See below comparisons of 2013 to 2012 and 2012 to 2011 for additional detail. (4) Active brokerage accounts include accounts with balances or activity within the preceding eight months. This metric is an indicator of the Company’s success in both attracting and retaining clients. See below comparisons of 2013 to 2012 and 2012 to 2011 for additional detail. (5) Calculated as net income available to common stockholders divided by common stockholders’ equity. N/M Not meaningful. 18 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Core net new client assets is defined as net new client assets before significant one-time flows. Management considers this to be a useful metric when comparing period-to-period client asset flows. The following one-time flows were excluded from core net new assets. · 2013 excludes outflows of $74.5 billion relating to the planned transfer of a mutual fund clearing services client. The Company also reduced its reported total for overall client assets by $24.7 billion in 2013 to reflect the estimated impact of the consolidation of its retirement plan recordkeeping technology platforms and subsequent resignation from certain retirement plan clients. · 2012 excludes inflows of $27.7 billion from mutual fund clearing services clients and $900 million from the acquisition of ThomasPartners, Inc., and outflows of $1.3 billion from the closure and/or sale of certain subsidiaries of optionsXpress. · 2011 excludes inflows of $56.1 billion from a mutual fund clearing services client and $7.5 billion from the acquisition of optionsXpress. The Company’s major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue. The Company generates asset management and administration fees through its proprietary and third-party mutual fund offerings, as well as fee-based advisory solutions. Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue are impacted by securities valuations, interest rates, the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing funding sources, the Company’s ability to attract new clients, and client activity levels. The Company generates trading revenue through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenue primarily from trading activity in client fixed income securities. Trading revenue is impacted by trading volumes, the volatility of prices in the equity and fixed income markets, and commission rates. 2013 Compared to 2012 Valuations in the broad equity markets improved during 2013 compared to 2012, as the Nasdaq Composite Index, Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, and Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 38%, 30%, and 26%, respectively. While the federal funds target rate remained unchanged at a range of zero to 0.25%, the average 10-year Treasury yield increased by 55 basis points to 2.33% during 2013 compared to 2012. In the same period however, the average three-month Treasury Bill yield decreased by 3 basis points to 0.05%. The Company continued to experience growth in its client base during 2013 – core net new client assets totaled $140.8 billion, up 25% from $112.4 billion in 2012. Total client assets ended the year at a record $2.25 trillion, up 15% from 2012. In addition, the Company added almost 1 million new brokerage accounts during 2013, and active brokerage accounts reached 9.1 million, up 3% from 2012. As a result of the Company’s strong key client activity metrics, the Company achieved a pre-tax profit margin of 31.4% in 2013. Overall, net income increased by 15% in 2013 from 2012 and the return on average common stockholders’ equity was 11% in 2013. Along with the growth in its client base, enrollments in client advisory solutions and stability in the economic environment helped the Company achieve increases in all three major revenue lines in 2013 compared to 2012. Overall, net revenues increased by 11% in 2013 from 2012, primarily due to increases in asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue, partially offset by a decrease in other revenue – net. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to increases in mutual fund service fees and advice solutions fees. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher balances of interest-earning assets and higher interest rates on new fixed-rate investments. This increase was partially offset by the effect lower average short-term interest rates and the maturity of short-term interest-earning assets had on the Company’s average net interest margin. Trading revenue increased primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades and two additional trading days during the year. Other revenue – net decreased primarily due to a non-recurring gain of $70 million relating to a confidential resolution of a vendor dispute in 2012. Expenses excluding interest increased by 9% in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits, professional services, advertising and market development, and other expense. Compensation and benefits expense increased 19 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to higher incentive compensation relating to the transition to a new payout schedule for field incentive plans, increased individual sales performance compensation as a result of field sales volume, increased and accelerated health savings account (HSA) contributions, equity incentive plan changes to vesting for retirement-eligible employees, and increased funding for the corporate bonus plan commensurate with achieving higher earnings per common share. Advertising and market development expense increased primarily due to investment in the Company’s new advertising and branding initiative, Own your tomorrow™. 2012 Compared to 2011 Valuations in the broad equity markets improved during 2012 compared to 2011, as the Nasdaq Composite Index, Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, and Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 16%, 13%, and 7%, respectively. While the federal funds target rate remained unchanged at a range of zero to 0.25%, the average three-month Treasury Bill yield increased by 4 basis points to 0.08% during 2012 compared to 2011. At the same time, the average 10-year Treasury yield decreased by 98 basis points to 1.78%. Despite continuing economic and interest rate challenges during the year, the Company’s sustained client focus helped deliver strong key client activity metrics in 2012. While net new client assets decreased slightly by 4% to $139.7 billion in 2012, core net new client assets totaled $112.4 billion, up 37% from $82.3 billion in 2011. Total client assets ended the year at a record $1.95 trillion, up 16% from 2011. In addition, the Company added 900,000 new brokerage accounts to its client base during 2012, a decrease of 21% from the prior year due to the removal of approximately 30,000 accounts due to escheatment and other factors in 2012, and the addition of 315,000 new brokerage accounts from the acquisition of optionsXpress in 2011. Active brokerage accounts reached a record 8.8 million, up 3% from 2011. Net revenues increased by 4% in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to increases in asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and other revenue – net, partially offset by a decrease in trading revenue. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to increases in advice solutions fees and other asset management and administration fees. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the effect of low overall interest rates and higher amortization of premiums relating to mortgage-backed securities. Other revenue – net increased primarily due to a non-recurring gain of $70 million relating to a confidential resolution of a vendor dispute in the second quarter of 2012. Trading revenue decreased primarily due to lower daily average revenue trades, partially offset by the inclusion of optionsXpress’ trading activity from its acquisition in September 2011. Expenses excluding interest were higher by 4% in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of optionsXpress’ expenses. Taxes on income in 2012 include a non-recurring state tax benefit of $20 million recorded in the third quarter of 2012. Overall, growth in the Company’s client base and ongoing expense discipline helped the Company increase net income by 7% in 2012 from 2011, and achieve a pre-tax profit margin of 29.7% and return on common stockholders’ equity of 11% in 2012. CURRENT MARKET AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS To the extent short-term interest rates remain at current low levels, the Company’s net interest revenue will continue to be constrained, even as growth in average balances helps to increase such revenue. The low short-term interest rate environment also affects asset management and administration fees. The Company continues to waive a portion of its management fees, as the overall yields on certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds have remained at levels at or below the management fees on those funds. These and certain other Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds may not be able to replace maturing securities with securities of equal or higher yields. As a result, the yields on such funds may remain around or decline from their current levels, and therefore below the stated management fees on those funds. To the extent this occurs, asset management and administration fees may continue to be negatively affected. In July 2013, the U.S. banking agencies issued regulatory capital rules that implemented BASEL III and relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (Final Regulatory Capital Rules), which are applicable to savings and loan holding companies, such as CSC, and federal savings banks, such as Schwab Bank. The rules will be phased in beginning on January 1, 2015. 20 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The Final Regulatory Capital Rules, among other things: · subject savings and loan holding companies to consolidated capital requirements; · revise the required minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements by (1) establishing a new minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio (common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets) of 4.5%; (2) raising the minimum Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio from 4.0% to 6.0%; (3) maintaining the minimum Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 8.0%; and (4) maintaining a minimum Tier 1 Leverage Ratio (Tier 1 capital to adjusted average consolidated assets) of 4.0%; · add a requirement to maintain a minimum capital conservation buffer, composed of common equity Tier 1 capital, of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, which means that banking organizations, on a fully phased-in basis no later than January 1, 2019, must maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio greater than 7.0%; a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio greater than 8.5% and a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio greater than 10.5%; and · change the definition of capital categories for insured depository: to be considered “well-capitalized”, Schwab Bank must have a Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of at least 8%, a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of at least 10% and a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of at least 5%. The new minimum regulatory capital ratios and changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets are effective beginning January 1, 2015. The required minimum capital conservation buffer will be phased in incrementally, starting at 0.625% on January 1, 2016 and increasing to 1.25% on January 1, 2017, 1.875% on January 1, 2018 and 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The Final Regulatory Capital Rules provide that the failure to maintain the minimum capital conservation buffer will result in restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers. The Company does not expect the Final Regulatory Capital Rules to have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. On October 24, 2013, the Federal Reserve, in collaboration with the OCC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking that would implement a quantitative liquidity requirement generally consistent with the LCR standard established by Basel III. The LCR would apply to all internationally active banking organizations. The Federal Reserve also proposed a modified LCR standard, which would apply to the Company. Under the modified LCR, a depository institution holding company would be required to maintain high-quality liquid assets in an amount related to its total net cash outflows over a prospective period. The proposed transition period for the rule would begin on January 1, 2015, and institutions would be required to be fully compliant by January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the proposed rule, which may be subject to further modification. In April 2013, the SEC published notice of a National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) proposed rule change that would impose a supplemental liquidity funding obligation on certain NSCC participants. The NSCC is a subsidiary of DTCC. The stated purpose was to provide the NSCC with sufficient liquidity and financial resources to withstand a default by one of its members. The rule change, as proposed, could have required the Company to provide a supplemental liquidity deposit relating to options activity (Special SLD) and a supplemental liquidity deposit relating to equities activity (Regular SLD). The proposed rule change with regard to the Special SLD was approved and went into effect on February 1, 2014, and the Company does not expect the rule change to have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. However, the proposed rule change with regard to the Regular SLD was withdrawn and alternative proposals are currently being discussed. The Company is pursuing lawsuits in state court in San Francisco for rescission and damages against issuers, underwriters, and dealers of individual non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities on which the Company has experienced realized and unrealized losses. The lawsuits allege that offering documents for the securities contained material untrue and misleading statements about the securities and the underwriting standards and credit quality of the underlying loans. On January 27, 2012, and July 24, 2012, the court denied defendants’ motions to dismiss the claims with respect to all but 3 of the 51 securities, and discovery is proceeding. 21 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion is an analysis of the Company’s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011. Net Revenues The Company’s major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue. Asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue all increased in 2013 as compared to 2012. Asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue increased, while trading revenue decreased in 2012 as compared to 2011.

The Company earns mutual fund service fees for shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. These fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in these funds. The Company also earns asset management fees for advice solutions, which include advisory and managed account services that are based on the daily balances of client assets subject to the specific fee for service. The fair values of client assets included in proprietary and third-party mutual funds are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data. Other asset management and administration fees include various asset based fees, such as third-party mutual fund service fees, trust fees, 401(k) record keeping fees, and mutual fund clearing and other service fees. Asset management and administration fees vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity. For a discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees, see “Current Market and Regulatory Environment and Other Developments.” Asset management and administration fees increased by $272 million, or 13%, in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to increases in mutual fund service fees and advice solutions fees. Asset management and administration fees increased by $115 million, 22 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) or 6%, in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to an increase in advice solutions fees and other asset management and administration fees. Mutual fund service fees increased by $84 million, or 8%, in 2013 from 2012, due to market appreciation and growth in client assets invested in the Company’s Mutual Fund OneSource funds and equity and bond funds, partially offset by a decrease in net money market mutual fund fees as a result of lower yields on fund assets. Mutual fund service fees were relatively flat in 2012 from 2011, which reflected growth in client assets invested in money market mutual funds, equity and bond funds, and Mutual Fund OneSource funds, offset by the effect of lower yields on certain fund assets. Advice solutions fees increased by $138 million, or 24%, in 2013 from 2012 and by $58 million, or 11%, in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to growth in client assets enrolled in advisory and managed account programs, including Windhaven®, Schwab Private ClientTM, and ThomasPartners. Other asset management and administration fees increased by $50 million, or 14%, in 2013 from 2012 and $43 million, or 14%, in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to an increase in third-party mutual fund service fees as a result of an increase in client asset balances invested in other third-party mutual funds. Net Interest Revenue Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies. The majority of the Company’s interest-earnings assets and interest-bearing liabilities are sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. The Company’s investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall. When interest rates fall, the Company may attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending the maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lock in asset yields, and by lowering rates paid to clients on interest-bearing liabilities. Since the Company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients, as well as the rates charged on receivables from brokerage clients, and also controls the composition of its investment securities, it has some ability to manage its net interest spread. However, the spread is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition. The current low interest rate environment limits the extent to which the Company can reduce interest expense paid on funding sources. To a lesser degree, the Company is sensitive to changes in long-term interest rates through some of its investment portfolios. To mitigate the related risk, the Company may alter the types of investments purchased. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on net interest revenue, see “Current Market and Regulatory Environment and Other Developments.” The Company’s interest-earning assets are financed primarily by brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients. Non-interest-bearing funding sources include non-interest-bearing brokerage client cash balances, stockholders’ equity, and proceeds from stock-lending activities. Revenue from stock-lending activities is included in other interest revenue. Schwab Bank maintains available for sale and held to maturity investment portfolios for liquidity as well as to invest funds from deposits that are in excess of loans to banking clients and liquidity requirements. Schwab Bank lends funds to banking clients primarily in the form of mortgage loans, HELOCs, and personal loans secured by securities. These loans are largely funded by interest-bearing deposits from banking clients. In clearing their clients’ trades, Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. hold cash balances payable to clients. In most cases, Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. pay their clients interest on cash balances awaiting investment, and in turn invest these funds and earn interest revenue. Receivables from brokerage clients consist primarily of margin loans to brokerage clients. Margin loans are loans made to clients on a secured basis to purchase securities. Pursuant to applicable regulations, client cash balances that are not used for margin lending are generally segregated into investment accounts that are maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients, which are recorded in cash and investments segregated on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. When investing segregated client cash balances, Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. must adhere to applicable regulations that restrict investments to securities guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, participation 23 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) certificates, mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association, deposits held at U.S. banks and thrifts, and resale agreements collateralized by qualified securities. Additionally, Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. have established policies for the minimum credit quality and maximum maturity of these investments.

(2) Amounts have been calculated based on amortized cost. Net interest revenue increased in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to higher balances of interest-earning assets and higher interest rates on new fixed-rate investments, including securities available for sale and securities held to maturity, partially offset by the effect lower average short-term interest rates and the maturity of short-term interest-earning assets had on the Company’s average net interest margin. The growth in the average balance of deposits from banking clients funded the increase in the balance of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity. Net interest revenue also increased due to the redemption of higher rate trust preferred securities and the exchange of higher rate Senior Notes during the third quarter of 2012. Net interest revenue increased in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to higher balances of interest-earning assets, primarily securities available for sale, partially offset by the effect of low overall interest rates and higher amortization of premiums relating to mortgage-backed securities. Growth in the average balance of deposits from banking clients funded the increase in the balance of securities available for sale. Trading Revenue Trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenue is affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. Principal transaction revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from trading activity in client fixed income securities. To accommodate clients’ fixed income trading activity, the Company maintains positions in fixed income securities, including state and municipal debt obligations, U.S. Government, corporate debt, and other securities. The difference between the price at which the Company buys and sells securities to and from its clients and other broker-dealers is recognized as principal transaction revenue. Principal transaction 24 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) revenue also includes adjustments to the fair value of these securities positions. Factors that influence principal transaction revenue include the volume of client trades and market price volatility. Trading revenue increased by $45 million, or 5%, in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades and two additional trading days in 2013. Trading revenue decreased by $59 million, or 6%, in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to lower daily average revenue trades, partially offset by the inclusion of optionsXpress’ trading activity for the full year. Daily average revenue trades increased by 4% in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to a higher volume of equity and mutual fund trades, partially offset by a lower volume of future and option trades. Daily average revenue trades decreased by 7% in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to a lower volume of equity and mutual fund trades, partially offset by a higher volume of option and future trades as a result of the inclusion of optionsXpress. Average revenue per revenue trade remained relatively flat from 2011 to 2013. Growth Rate Year Ended December 31, 2012-2013 2013 2012 2011 Daily average revenue trades (1) (in thousands) 4 % 295.0 282.7 303.8 Clients’ daily average trades (2) (in thousands) 11 % 490.5 440.9 451.1 Number of trading days (3) 1 % 250.5 248.5 251.5 Average revenue per revenue trade - $ 12.31 $ 12.35 $ 12.15 (1) Includes all client trades that generate trading revenue (i.e., commission revenue or principal transaction revenue). (2) Includes daily average revenue trades, trades by clients in asset-based pricing relationships, and all commission-free trades, including the Company’s Mutual Fund OneSource funds and ETFs, and other proprietary products. Clients’ daily average trades is an indicator of client engagement with securities markets. (3) October 29 and 30, 2012, were not included as trading days due to weather-related market closures. Other Revenue – Net Other revenue – net includes order flow revenue, nonrecurring gains, software fees from the Company’s portfolio management services, exchange processing fees, realized gains or losses on sales of securities available for sale, and other service fees. Other revenue – net decreased by $20 million, or 8%, in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to a non-recurring gain of $70 million relating to a confidential resolution of a vendor dispute in the second quarter of 2012 and realized gains of $35 million from the sales of securities available for sale in 2012, partially offset by an increase in order flow revenue that Schwab began receiving in November 2012. Other revenue – net increased by $96 million, or 60%, in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a non-recurring gain of $70 million relating to a confidential resolution of a vendor dispute mentioned above. In November 2012, the Company began receiving additional order flow rebates from market venues to which client orders are routed for execution. Order flow revenue increased by $23 million due to this revenue and the inclusion of a full year of optionsXpress’ order flow revenue. In December 2012, CSC redeemed the remaining outstanding portion of its 4.950% Senior Notes of $494 million that were due in 2014, which resulted in the payment of a make-whole premium of $31 million that was recorded in other revenue – net. Other revenue – net also included realized gains of $35 million from the sales of securities available for sale. Provision for Loan Losses The provision for loan losses decreased by $17 million in 2013, from $16 million to $(1) million in 2012 and 2013, respectively, primarily due to improved residential real estate mortgage and HELOC credit quality in the Company’s loan portfolio. The provision for loan losses was relatively flat in 2012 from 2011, reflecting stable levels of delinquencies and nonaccrual loans experienced in 2012. Charge-offs were $11 million, $16 million, and $19 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. For further discussion on the Company’s credit risk and the allowance for loan losses, see “Risk Management – Credit Risk” and “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 6. Loans to Banking Clients and Related Allowance for Loan Losses.” 25 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Net Impairment Losses on Securities Net impairment losses on securities were $10 million, $32 million, and $31 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. These charges were lower in 2013 compared to 2012, reflecting a stabilization of the credit characteristics of certain non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities’ underlying loans. For further discussion, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 5. Securities Available for Sale and Securities Held to Maturity.” Expenses Excluding Interest As shown in the table below, expenses excluding interest were higher in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits, professional services, advertising and market development, and other expense. Expenses excluding interest were higher in 2012 compared to 2011, which was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of optionsXpress’ expenses and amortization of intangible assets relating to the optionsXpress acquisition. Growth Rate Year Ended December 31, 2012-2013 2013 2012 2011 Compensation and benefits 12 % $ 2,027 $ 1,803 $ 1,732 Professional services 7 % 415 388 387 Occupancy and equipment (1) % 309 311 301 Advertising and market development 7 % 257 241 228 Communications - 220 220 220 Depreciation and amortization 3 % 202 196 155 Class action litigation and regulatory reserve (1) - - - 7 Other 9 % 300 274 269 Total expenses excluding interest 9 % $ 3,730 $ 3,433 $ 3,299 Expenses as a percentage of total net revenues: Total expenses excluding interest 69 % 70 % 70 % Advertising and market development 5 % 5 % 5 % (1) Relates to Schwab YieldPlus Fund®. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits expense includes salaries and wages, incentive compensation, and related employee benefits and taxes. Incentive compensation includes variable compensation, discretionary bonuses, and stock-based compensation. Variable compensation includes payments to certain individuals based on their sales performance. Discretionary bonuses are based on the Company’s overall performance as measured by earnings per common share, and therefore will fluctuate with this measure. Stock-based compensation primarily includes employee and board of director stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock awards. 26 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Compensation and benefits expense increased by $224 million, or 12%, in 2013 from 2012, and $471 million, or 4%, in 2012 from 2011, due to increases in salaries and wages, incentive compensation and employee benefits and other expense. The following table shows a comparison of certain compensation and benefits components and employee data: Growth Rate Year Ended December 31, 2012-2013 2013 2012 2011 Salaries and wages 6 % $ 1,110 $ 1,043 $ 1,012 Incentive compensation 29 % 599 466 444 Employee benefits and other 8 % 318 294 276 Total compensation and benefits expense 12 % $ 2,027 $ 1,803 $ 1,732 Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total net revenues: Salaries and wages 20 % 21 % 22 % Incentive compensation 11 % 10 % 9 % Employee benefits and other 6 % 6 % 6 % Total compensation and benefits expense 37 % 37 % 37 % Full-time equivalent employees (in thousands) (1) At year end - 13.8 13.8 14.1 Average 1 % 13.9 13.8 13.4 (1) Includes full-time, part-time and temporary employees, and persons employed on a contract basis, and excludes employees of outsourced service providers. Salaries and wages increased in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to annual salary increases. Incentive compensation increased in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to the transition to a new payout schedule for field incentive plans, increased individual sales performance compensation as a result of higher field sales volume, and increased funding for the corporate bonus plan commensurate with achieving higher earnings per common share. Employee benefits and other expense increased in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to payroll taxes related to the increase in incentive compensation, and increased contributions to new employee HSAs. The Company was converting to HSA-based healthcare and employee enrollment in these plans rose significantly in 2013. Salaries and wages increased in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to an increase in average full-time employees from the inclusion of a full year of optionsXpress’ employees. The increase in salaries and wages was partially offset by a decrease in persons employed on a contract basis. Incentive compensation increased in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to higher variable compensation resulting from product sales performance in the Company’s branch offices. Employee benefits and other expense increased in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to increases in payroll taxes and the Company’s 401(k) plan expense due to increases in average full-time employees and incentive compensation, and an increase in the Company’s deferred compensation plan expense as a result of improvement in the broad equity markets. Expenses Excluding Compensation and Benefits Professional services expense increased in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to an increase in fees paid to outsourced service providers and consultants and higher spending on printing and fulfillment services. Professional services expense was relatively flat in 2012 compared to 2011. Occupancy and equipment expense was relatively flat in 2013 compared to 2012. Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to an increase in software maintenance expense relating to the Company’s information technology systems. Advertising and market development expense increased in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to higher spending on media relating to the launch of the Company’s new advertising and branding initiative, Own your tomorrowTM. Advertising and market development expense increased in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of optionsXpress’ expenses, which includes media, and the Company’s increased spending on customer promotions. 27 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Depreciation and amortization expense was relatively flat in 2013 compared to 2012. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets relating to the optionsXpress acquisition. Other expense increased in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to an increase in regulatory assessments. Other expense was relatively flat in 2012 compared to 2011. Taxes on Income The Company’s effective income tax rate on income before taxes was 37.2% in 2013, 36.0% in 2012, and 37.9% in 2011. The increase in 2013 from 2012 was primarily due to the impact of a non-recurring state tax benefit of $20 million in 2012, partially offset by the recognition of an additional state tax benefit of $4 million in 2013. The decrease in 2012 from 2011 was primarily due to the recognition of the non-recurring state tax benefit discussed above. Segment Information The Company provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments – Investor Services and Advisor Services. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services to individual investors, retirement plan services, and corporate brokerage services. The Advisor Services segment provides custodial, trading, and support services to independent investment advisors, and retirement business services to independent retirement plan advisors and recordkeepers whose plan assets are held at Schwab Bank. Banking revenues and expenses are allocated to the Company’s two segments based on which segment services the client. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments on a pre-tax basis, excluding items such as significant nonrecurring gains, impairment charges on non-financial assets, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and significant restructuring and other charges. Segment assets and liabilities are not used for evaluating segment performance or in deciding how to allocate resources to segments. 28 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Financial information for the Company’s reportable segments is presented in the following tables: Investor Services Advisor Services Growth Rate Growth Rate Year Ended December 31, 2012-2013 2013 2012 2011 2012-2013 2013 2012 2011 Net Revenues Asset management and administration fees 13 % $ 1,627 $ 1,436 $ 1,357 14 % $ 689 $ 607 $ 571 Net interest revenue 13 % 1,756 1,559 1,542 9 % 224 205 183 Trading revenue 1 % 621 612 667 15 % 292 255 260 Other – net 45 % 178 123 98 (8) % 57 62 62 Provision for loan losses (107) % 1 (15) (16) (100) % - (1) (2) Net impairment losses on securities (69) % (9) (29) (29) (67) % (1) (3) (2) Total net revenues 13 % 4,174 3,686 3,619 12 % 1,261 1,125 1,072 Expenses Excluding Interest 8 % 2,899 2,693 2,569 12 % 831 739 731 Income before taxes on income 28 % $ 1,275 $ 993 $ 1,050 11 % $ 430 $ 386 $ 341 Unallocated Total Growth Rate Growth Rate Year Ended December 31, 2012-2013 2013 2012 2011 2012-2013 2013 2012 2011 Net Revenues Asset management and administration fees N/M $ (1) $ - $ - 13 % $ 2,315 $ 2,043 $ 1,928 Net interest revenue N/M - - - 12 % 1,980 1,764 1,725 Trading revenue N/M - 1 - 5 % 913 868 927 Other – net N/M 1 71 - (8) % 236 256 160 Provision for loan losses N/M - - - (106) % 1 (16) (18) Net impairment losses on securities N/M - - - (69) % (10) (32) (31) Total net revenues N/M - 72 - 11 % 5,435 4,883 4,691 Expenses Excluding Interest N/M - 1 (1) 9 % 3,730 3,433 3,299 Income before taxes on income N/M $ - $ 71 $ 1 18 % $ 1,705 $ 1,450 $ 1,392 N/M Not meaningful. Investor Services Net revenues increased by $488 million, or 13%, in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue, asset management and administration fees, and other revenue. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the effect lower average short-term interest rates had on the Company’s average net interest margin. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to increases in advice solutions fees and mutual fund service fees. Advice solutions fees increased due to growth in client assets enrolled in advisory offers, including Windhaven and Schwab Private Client. Mutual fund service fees increased due to market appreciation and growth in client assets invested in the Company’s Mutual Fund OneSource funds, and equity and bond funds, partially offset by a decrease in net money market mutual fund fees as a result of lower yields on fund assets. Other revenue – net increased primarily due to an increase in order flow revenue that Schwab began receiving in November 2012. Expenses excluding interest increased by $206 million, or 8%, in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits, professional services, advertising and market development, and other expenses. 29 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Net revenues were relatively flat in 2012 compared to 2011 as the increases in asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and other revenue – net were largely offset by a decrease in trading revenue. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to an increase in advice solutions fees relating to Windhaven, partially offset by a decrease in net money market mutual fund fees. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the effect of low overall interest rates and higher amortization of premiums relating to mortgage-backed securities. Other revenue – net increased primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of optionsXpress’ order flow revenue and other fees. Trading revenue decreased primarily due to lower daily average revenue trades, partially offset by the inclusion of optionsXpress’ trading activity for the full year. Expenses excluding interest increased by $124 million, or 5%, in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of optionsXpress’ compensation and benefits, depreciation and amortization, and advertising and market development expenses. Advisor Services Net revenues increased by $136 million, or 12%, in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to increases in asset management and administration fees, trading revenue, and net interest revenue. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to increases in mutual fund service fees and advice solutions fees. Mutual fund service fees increased due to market appreciation and growth in client assets invested in the Company’s Mutual Fund OneSource funds, and equity and bond funds. Advice solutions fees increased due to growth in client assets enrolled in advisory offers. Trading revenue increased primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades and two additional trading days in 2013. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the effect lower average short-term interest rates had on the Company’s average net interest margin. Expenses excluding interest increased by $92 million, or 12%, in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits, professional services, advertising and market development expenses, and other expenses. Net revenues increased by $53 million, or 5%, in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to increases in asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue, partially offset by a decrease in trading revenue. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to an increase in third-party mutual fund service fees. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the effect of low overall interest rates and higher amortization of premiums relating to mortgage-backed securities. Trading revenue decreased primarily due to lower daily average revenue trades. Expenses excluding interest were relatively flat in 2012 compared to 2011. Unallocated Other revenue – net in 2012 includes a non-recurring gain of $70 million relating to a confidential resolution of a vendor dispute. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CSC conducts substantially all of its business through its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company’s capital structure is designed to provide each subsidiary with capital and liquidity to meet its operational needs and regulatory requirements. CSC is a savings and loan holding company and Schwab Bank, CSC’s depository institution, is a federal savings bank. CSC is subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve and Schwab Bank is subject to supervision and regulation by the OCC. Liquidity CSC CSC’s liquidity needs arise from funding its subsidiaries’ operations, including margin and mortgage lending, and transaction settlement, in addition to funding cash dividends, acquisitions, investments, short- and long-term debt, and managing statutory capital requirements. 30 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) CSC’s liquidity needs are generally met through cash generated by its subsidiaries, as well as cash provided by external financing. CSC has a universal automatic shelf registration statement (Shelf Registration Statement) on file with the SEC which enables CSC to issue debt, equity, and other securities. CSC maintains excess liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments to cover daily funding needs and to support growth in the Company’s business. Generally, CSC does not hold liquidity at its subsidiaries in excess of amounts deemed sufficient to support the subsidiaries’ operations, including any regulatory capital requirements. Schwab, Schwab Bank, and optionsXpress, Inc. are subject to regulatory requirements that may restrict them from certain transactions with CSC, as further discussed below. Management believes that funds generated by the operations of CSC’s subsidiaries will continue to be the primary funding source in meeting CSC’s liquidity needs, providing adequate liquidity to meet Schwab Bank’s capital guidelines, and maintaining Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc.’s net capital. On July 25, 2013, CSC issued $275 million of Senior Notes that mature in 2018 under its Shelf Registration Statement. The Senior Notes have a fixed interest rate of 2.20% with interest payable semi-annually. While CSC is not currently subject to specific statutory capital requirements, CSC is required to serve as a source of strength for Schwab Bank and must have the ability to provide financial assistance if Schwab Bank experiences financial distress. To manage capital adequacy, the Company currently utilizes a target Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for CSC, as currently defined by the Federal Reserve, of at least 6%. At December 31, 2013, CSC’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 6.4%, Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 16.7%, and Total Capital Ratio was 16.8%. The following are details of CSC’s long-term debt: Par Standard December 31, 2013 Outstanding Maturity Interest Rate Moody’s & Poor’s Fitch Senior Notes $ 1,581 2015 – 2022 0.850% to 4.45% fixed A2 A A Medium Term Notes $ 250 2017 6.375% fixed A2 A A CSC has authorization from its Board of Directors to issue unsecured commercial paper notes (Commercial Paper Notes) not to exceed $1.5 billion. Management has set a current limit for the commercial paper program of $800 million. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes may vary, but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper is not redeemable prior to maturity and cannot be voluntarily prepaid. The proceeds of the commercial paper program are to be used for general corporate purposes. There were no borrowings of Commercial Paper Notes outstanding at December 31, 2013. CSC’s ratings for these short-term borrowings are P1 by Moody’s, A1 by Standard & Poor’s, and F1 by Fitch. CSC maintains an $800 million committed, unsecured credit facility with a group of 12 banks, which is scheduled to expire in June 2014. This facility replaced a similar facility that expired in June 2013 and both facilities were unused in 2013. The funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes. The financial covenants under this facility require Schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, as defined, Schwab Bank to be well capitalized, as defined, and CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity. At December 31, 2013, the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was $7.1 billion (CSC’s stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2013, was $10.4 billion). Management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on CSC’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements. CSC also has direct access to $647 million of the $942 million uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines discussed below, that are primarily utilized by Schwab to manage short-term liquidity. These lines were not used by CSC during 2013. In addition, Schwab provides CSC with a $1.0 billion credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in December 2014. There were no funds drawn under this facility at December 31, 2013. 31 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Schwab Schwab’s liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts, which were $33.2 billion and $37.4 billion at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for Schwab. Schwab is subject to regulatory requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Uniform Net Capital Rule) that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit Schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings from CSC, paying cash dividends, or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000. At December 31, 2013, Schwab’s net capital was $1.4 billion (10% of aggregate debit balances), which was $1.2 billion in excess of its minimum required net capital and $707 million in excess of 5% of aggregate debit balances. Schwab is also subject to Rule 15c3-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and other applicable regulations that require it to maintain cash or qualified securities in a segregated reserve account for the exclusive benefit of clients. These funds are included in cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and are not available as a general source of liquidity. Most of Schwab’s assets are readily convertible to cash, consisting primarily of short-term (i.e., less than 150 days) investment-grade, interest-earning investments (the majority of which are segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients pursuant to regulatory requirements), receivables from brokerage clients, and receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations. Client margin loans are demand loan obligations secured by readily marketable securities. Receivables from and payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations primarily represent current open transactions, which usually settle, or can be closed out, within a few business days. Schwab has a finance lease obligation related to an office building and land under a 20-year lease. The remaining finance lease obligation of $89 million at December 31, 2013, is being reduced by a portion of the lease payments over the remaining lease term of 11 years. To manage short-term liquidity, Schwab maintains uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines with a group of six banks totaling $942 million at December 31, 2013. The need for short-term borrowings arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest-earnings investments, and movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements. Schwab used such borrowings for ten days in 2013, with average daily amounts borrowed of $64 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2013. To partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation, Schwab has unsecured standby letter of credit agreements (LOCs) with five banks in favor of the Options Clearing Corporation aggregating $225 million at December 31, 2013. There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs during 2013. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. Schwab satisfies the collateral requirements by providing cash as collateral. To manage Schwab’s regulatory capital requirement, CSC provides Schwab with a $1.4 billion subordinated revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in March 2014. Schwab plans to renew this facility when it expires. The amount outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2013, was $315 million. Borrowings under this subordinated lending arrangement qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab. In addition, CSC provides Schwab with a $2.5 billion credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in December 2014. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab. The amount outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2013, was $605 million. 32 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Schwab Bank Schwab Bank’s liquidity needs are met through deposits from banking clients and equity capital. Deposits from banking clients at December 31, 2013 were $93.0 billion, which includes the excess cash held in certain Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. brokerage accounts that is swept into deposit accounts at Schwab Bank. At December 31, 2013, these balances totaled $72.2 billion. Schwab Bank is subject to regulatory requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions, such as extensions of credit and repayment of loans between Schwab Bank and CSC or CSC’s other subsidiaries. In addition, Schwab Bank is required to provide notice to and may be required to obtain approval of the OCC and the Federal Reserve to declare dividends to CSC. Schwab Bank is required to maintain capital levels as specified in federal banking laws and regulations. Failure to meet the minimum levels could result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on Schwab Bank. The Company currently utilizes a target Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for Schwab Bank of at least 6.25%. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2013, Schwab Bank is considered well capitalized. Schwab Bank’s regulatory capital and ratios are as follows: Minimum to be Minimum Capital Actual Well Capitalized Requirement December 31, 2013 Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital $ 6,550 19.0 % $ 2,074 6.0 % $ 1,383 4.0 % Total Risk-Based Capital $ 6,599 19.1 % $ 3,457 10.0 % $ 2,766 8.0 % Tier 1 Leverage $ 6,550 6.6 % $ 4,993 5.0 % $ 3,994 4.0 % Tangible Equity $ 6,550 6.6 % N/A $ 1,997 2.0 % N/A Not applicable. Schwab Bank has access to traditional funding sources such as deposits, federal funds purchased, and repurchase agreements. Additionally, Schwab Bank has access to short-term funding through the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) discount window. Amounts available under the FRB discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain of Schwab Bank’s securities available for sale and/or securities held to maturity that are pledged as collateral to the FRB. Schwab Bank maintains policies and procedures necessary to access this funding and tests discount window borrowing procedures annually. At December 31, 2013, $2.6 billion was available under this arrangement. There were no funds drawn under this arrangement during 2013. Schwab Bank maintains a credit facility with the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Amounts available under this facility are dependent on the amount of Schwab Bank’s residential real estate mortgages and HELOCs that are pledged as collateral. Schwab Bank maintains policies and procedures necessary to access this funding and tests borrowing procedures annually. At December 31, 2013, $6.8 billion was available under this facility. There were no funds drawn under this facility during 2013. optionsXpress, Inc. optionsXpress, Inc.’s liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts, which were $1.1 billion at December 31, 2013. Management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for optionsXpress, Inc. optionsXpress, Inc., is subject to regulatory requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit optionsXpress, Inc. from paying cash dividends or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000. At December 31, 2013, optionsXpress Inc.’s net capital was $102 million (36% of aggregate debit balances), which was $96 million in excess of its minimum required net capital and $88 million in excess of 5% of aggregate debit balances. 33 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) optionsXpress, Inc. is also subject to Commodity Futures Trading Commission Regulation 1.17 (Reg. 1.17) under the Commodity Exchange Act, which also requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. optionsXpress, Inc. as a futures commission merchant, is required to maintain minimum net capital equal to the greater of its net capital requirement under Reg. 1.17 ($1 million), or the sum of 8% of the total risk margin requirements for all positions carried in customer accounts and 8% of the total risk margin requirements for all positions carried in non-customer accounts (as defined in Reg. 1.17). At December 31, 2013, optionsXpress, Inc. met the requirements of Reg. 1.17. Additionally, optionsXpress, Inc. is subject to Rule 15c3-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and other applicable regulations that require it to maintain cash or qualified securities in a segregated reserve account for the exclusive benefit of clients. These funds are included in cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and are not available as a general source of liquidity. To partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation, optionsXpress, Inc. has an unsecured standby LOC with one bank in favor of the Options Clearing Corporation in the amount of $15 million at December 31, 2013. There were no funds drawn under this LOC during 2013. CSC provides optionsXpress, Inc. with a $200 million credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in December 2014. The amount outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2013, was $25 million. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for optionsXpress, Inc. optionsXpress Holdings, Inc., optionsXpress, Inc.’s parent company, has a term loan with CSC, of which $35 million was outstanding at December 31, 2013, and it matures in December 2017. Capital Resources The Company monitors both the relative composition and absolute level of its capital structure. Management is focused on optimizing the Company’s use of capital and currently targets a long-term debt to total financial capital ratio not to exceed 30%. The Company’s total financial capital (long-term debt plus stockholders’ equity) at December 31, 2013 was $12.3 billion, up $1.1 billion, or 9%, from December 31, 2012. The Company’s cash position (reported as cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated balance sheets) and cash flows are affected by changes in brokerage client cash balances and the associated amounts required to be segregated under regulatory guidelines. Timing differences between cash and investments actually segregated on a given date and the amount required to be segregated for that date may arise in the ordinary course of business and are addressed by the Company in accordance with applicable regulations. Other factors which affect the Company’s cash position and cash flows include investment activity in security portfolios, levels of capital expenditures, acquisition and divestiture activity, banking client deposit activity, brokerage and banking client loan activity, financing activity in long-term debt, payments of dividends, and repurchases and issuances of CSC’s preferred and common stock. The combination of these factors can cause significant fluctuations in the cash position during specific time periods. Long-term Debt At December 31, 2013, the Company had long-term debt of $1.9 billion, or 15% of total financial capital, that bears interest at a weighted-average rate of 3.61%. At December 31, 2012, the Company had long-term debt of $1.6 billion, or 15% of total financial capital. On July 25, 2013, CSC issued $275 million of Senior Notes that mature in 2018 under its Shelf Registration Statement. The Senior Notes have a fixed interest rate of 2.20% with interest payable semi-annually. The Company repaid $6 million of other long-term debt in 2013. For further discussion of the Company’s long-term debt, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Liquidity” and “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 13. Borrowings.” 34 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Capital Expenditures The Company’s capital expenditures were $270 million (5% of net revenues) and $138 million (3% of net revenues) in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2013 were primarily for buildings and land, capitalized costs for developing internal-use software, and software and equipment relating to the Company’s information technology systems. Capital expenditures in 2012 were primarily for capitalized costs for developing internal-use software, software and equipment relating to the Company’s information technology systems, and leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs for developing internal-use software were $74 million and $61 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Management currently anticipates that 2014 capital expenditures will be approximately 20% higher than 2013 primarily due to increased spending on buildings and land, furniture and equipment, and leasehold improvements. A majority of this planned increase is related to the continued consolidation and relocation of the Company’s existing office campus in Denver, Colorado. As in recent years, the Company adjusts its capital expenditures periodically as business conditions change. Management believes that funds generated by its operations will continue to be the primary funding source of its capital expenditures. Equity Offerings In January 2012, the Company issued and sold 400,000 shares of fixed-to-floating rate (currently fixed at 7.000%) non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series A, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share for net proceeds of $394 million (Series A Preferred Stock). In June 2012, the Company issued and sold 485,000 shares of 6.00% non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series B, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share for net proceeds of $469 million (Series B Preferred Stock). Net proceeds received from these sales were used for general corporate purposes. For further discussion of these equity offerings, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 17. Stockholders’ Equity.” Dividends CSC paid common stock cash dividends of $311 million ($0.24 per share) and $308 million ($0.24 per share) in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Since the initial dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 99 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend rate 19 times, resulting in a 22% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, the Company currently targets its common stock cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income. CSC paid Series A Preferred Stock cash dividends of $28 million ($70.00 per share) and $14 million ($36.17 per share) in 2013 and 2012, respectively. CSC paid Series B Preferred Stock cash dividends of $29 million ($60.00 per share) and $14 million ($29.17 per share) in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Share Repurchases There were no repurchases of CSC’s common stock in 2013 or 2012. As of December 31, 2013, CSC had remaining authority from the Board of Directors to repurchase up to $596 million of its common stock, which does not have an expiration date. Business Acquisitions On December 14, 2012, the Company acquired ThomasPartners, Inc., a growth and dividend income-focused asset management firm, for $85 million in cash. On September 1, 2011, the Company acquired optionsXpress, an online brokerage firm primarily focused on equity option securities and futures, for total consideration of $714 million. Under the terms of the merger agreement, optionsXpress stockholders received 1.02 shares of the Company’s common stock for each share of optionsXpress stock. As a result, the 35 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Company issued 59 million shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $710 million, based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on September 1, 2011. The Company also assumed optionsXpress’ stock-based compensation awards valued at $4 million. For more information on these acquisitions, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 24. Business Acquisitions.” Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of its clients. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, the Company enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For information on each of these arrangements, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 14. Commitments and Contingencies. and “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 15. Financial Instruments Subject to Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk or Concentration Risk.” Contractual Obligations The Company’s principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013, are shown in the following table. Management believes that funds generated by its continuing operations, as well as cash provided by external financing, will continue to be the primary funding sources in meeting these obligations. Excluded from this table are liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet that are generally short-term in nature (e.g., payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations) or without contractual payment terms (e.g., deposits from banking clients, payables to brokerage clients, and deferred compensation).

Includes purchase obligations that can be canceled by the Company without penalty. 36 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Risk MANAGEMENT The Company’s business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, credit, market, liquidity, compliance and legal risk. The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. Despite the Company’s efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks. The Company’s risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting and risk mitigation. The activities and organizations that comprise the risk management process are described below. Risk Culture The Company’s Board of Directors sets the tone for effective risk management and has approved an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework commensurate with the size, risk profile, complexity, and continuing growth of the Company. The ERM Framework and governance structure constitute a comprehensive approach to managing risks encountered by the Company in its business activities. Risk appetite, which is defined as the amount of risk the Company is willing to accept in pursuit of its corporate strategy, is set by executive management and approved by the Board of Directors. The Company has established risk metrics and reporting that enable the measurement of the impact of strategy execution against risk appetite. The risk metrics, with risk limits and tolerance levels, are established for key risk categories by the Global Risk Committee and its functional risk sub-committees. Risk Governance Senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring and controlling risks. The Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior executives from each major business and control function, is responsible for the oversight of risk management. This includes identifying emerging risks, assessing risk management practices and the control environment, reinforcing business accountability for risk management, supervisory controls and regulatory compliance, supporting resource prioritization across the Company, and escalating significant issues to the Board of Directors. The Global Risk Committee reports regularly to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. The Risk Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the Company’s risk management program, including approving risk appetite statements and reviewing reports relating to risk issues from functional areas of risk management, legal, compliance, and internal audit. Functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report into the Global Risk Committee. These sub-committees include the: · Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee, which establishes strategies and policies for the management of corporate capital, liquidity, interest rate risk, and investments; · Credit and Market Risk Oversight Committee, which provides oversight of and approves credit and market risk policies, limits, and exposures in loan, investment, and positioning portfolios; · New Products and Services Risk Oversight Committee, which provides oversight of, and approves corporate policy and procedures relating to the risk governance of new products and services; and the · Operational Risk Oversight Committee, which provides oversight of and approves operational risk management policies, risk tolerance levels, and operational risk governance processes, and includes the following sub-committees: o Information Security and Privacy Sub-Committee, which provides oversight of the information security and privacy programs and policies; 37 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) o Model Governance Sub-Committee, which provides oversight of model risk throughout the Company; and the o Vendor Management Sub-Committee, which provides oversight of the Company’s vendor management and outsourcing program and policies. The Company’s compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and corporate risk management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring the Company’s risk management. In addition, the Company’s Disclosure Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s (a) disclosure controls and procedures and (b) internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Operational Risk Operational risks arise due to potentially inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events and relationships impacting the Company and/or any of its key business partners and vendors. Operational risk includes model and fiduciary risk, and each is also described in detail below. The Company’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and the Company’s success depends, in part, on its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its technology in anticipation of evolving client needs. To the extent the Company experiences system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to its systems, linkages with third-party systems, and power failures), the Company’s business and operations could be significantly negatively impacted. To minimize business interruptions, Schwab has two data centers intended, in part, to further improve the recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency. The Company is committed to an ongoing process of upgrading, enhancing, and testing its technology systems. This effort is focused on meeting client needs, meeting market and regulatory changes, and deploying standardized technology platforms. Operational risk also includes the risk of human error, employee misconduct, external fraud, computer viruses, distributed denial of service attacks, terrorist attacks, and natural disaster. Employee misconduct could include fraud and misappropriation of client or Company assets, improper use or disclosure of confidential client or Company information, and unauthorized activities, such as transactions exceeding acceptable risks or authorized limits. External fraud includes misappropriation of client or Company assets by third parties, including through unauthorized access to Company systems and data and client accounts. The frequency and sophistication of such fraud attempts continue to increase. Operational risk is mitigated through a system of internal controls and risk management practices that are designed to keep operational risk and operational losses at levels appropriate to the inherent risk of the business in which the Company operates. The Company has specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and uses periodic risk self-assessments and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The Company maintains backup and recovery functions, including facilities for backup and communications, and conducts periodic testing of disaster recovery plans. The Company also maintains policies and procedures and technology to protect against fraud and unauthorized access to systems and data. Despite the Company’s risk management efforts, it is not always possible to deter or prevent technological or operational failure, or fraud or other misconduct, and the precautions taken by the Company may not be effective in all cases. The Company may be subject to litigation, losses, and regulatory actions in such cases, and may be required to expend significant additional resources to remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures. The Company also faces operational risk when it employs the services of various external vendors, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. The Company manages its exposure to external vendor risk through contractual provisions, control standards, and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance. The Company maintains policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with Company data, 38 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-public client information. The Company clearly defines for employees, contractors, and vendors the Company’s expected standards of care for confidential data. Regular training is provided by the Company in regard to data security. The Company is actively engaged in the research and development of new technologies, services, and products. The Company endeavors to protect its research and development efforts, and its brands, through the use of copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and contracts. Model Risk Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. Models are owned by several business units throughout the Company, and are used for a variety of purposes. Model use includes, but is not limited to, calculating capital requirements for hypothetical stressful environments, estimating interest and credit risk for loans and other balance sheet assets, and providing guidance in the management of client portfolios. The Company has established a policy to describe the roles and responsibilities of all key stakeholders in model development, management, and use. All models at the Company are registered in a centralized database and classified into different risk ratings depending on their potential financial, reputational, or regulatory impact to the Company. The model risk rating informs the scope of all model governance activities. Fiduciary Risk Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. The Company attempts to manage this risk by establishing procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees. Credit Risk Credit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations. The Company’s direct exposure to credit risk mainly results from margin lending and client option activities, securities lending activities, mortgage lending activities, its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and other investing activities. To manage the risks of such losses, the Company has established policies and procedures which include: establishing and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin and option requirements for certain securities. Collateral arrangements relating to margin loans, option positions, securities lending agreements, and resale agreements include provisions that require additional collateral in the event that market fluctuations result in declines in the value of collateral received. Additionally, for margin loan and securities lending agreements, collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral exceeds the amounts loaned. The Company’s credit risk exposure related to loans to banking clients is actively managed through individual and portfolio reviews performed by management. Management regularly reviews asset quality, including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. All are factors in management’s quarterly determination of an appropriate allowance for loan losses. The Company’s mortgage loan portfolios primarily include First Mortgages of $8.0 billion and HELOCs of $3.0 billion at December 31, 2013. The Company’s underwriting guidelines include maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan is conforming or jumbo). These credit underwriting standards have limited the exposure to the types of loans that experienced high foreclosures and loss rates elsewhere in the industry in recent years. There were no significant changes to the LTV ratio or FICO credit score underwriting guidelines related to the Company’s First Mortgage or HELOC portfolios during 2013. In January 2014, the 39 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Company revised its First Mortgage underwriting criteria in conformance with the CFPB’s new guidance on Qualified Mortgage lending and a borrower’s ability to repay. Revisions were made to requirements affecting Debt to Income Ratio, Loan to Value Ratio, and liquid asset holdings. The Company does not purchase loans that allow for negative amortization and does not purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. At December 31, 2013, approximately 1% of both the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios consisted of loans to borrowers with updated FICO scores of less than 620. At December 31, 2013, the weighted-average originated LTV ratio was 59% for both the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios. The computation of the origination LTV ratio for a HELOC includes any first lien mortgage outstanding on the same property at the time of origination. At December 31, 2013, 22% of HELOCs ($680 million of the HELOC portfolio) were in a first lien position. The weighted-average originated FICO credit score was 769 and 768 for the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, respectively. The Company monitors the estimated current LTV ratios of its First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios on an ongoing basis. At December 31, 2013, the weighted-average estimated current LTV ratios were 53% and 59% for the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, respectively. The computation of the estimated current LTV ratio for a HELOC includes any first lien mortgage outstanding on the same property at the time of the HELOC’s origination. The Company estimates the current LTV ratio for each loan by reference to a home price appreciation index. The Company also monitors updated borrower FICO scores, delinquency trends, and verified liquid assets held by individual borrowers. At December 31, 2013, the weighted-average updated FICO scores were 772 and 769 for the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, respectively. A portion of the Company’s HELOC portfolio is secured by second liens on the associated properties. Second lien mortgage loans possess a higher degree of credit risk given the subordination to the first lien holder in the event of default. At December 31, 2013, $2.4 billion, or 78%, of the HELOC portfolio was in a second lien position. In addition to the credit monitoring activities described above, the Company also monitors credit risk on second lien HELOC loans by reviewing the delinquency status of the first lien loan on the associated property. Additionally, at December 31, 2013, approximately 30% of the HELOC borrowers that had a balance only paid the minimum amount due. For more information on the Company’s credit quality indicators relating to its First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, including delinquency characteristics, borrower FICO scores at origination, updated borrower FICO scores, LTV ratios at origination, and estimated current LTV ratios, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 6. Loans to Banking Clients and Related Allowance for Loan Losses.” The following table presents certain of the Company’s loan quality metrics as a percentage of total outstanding loans: December 31, 2013 2012 Loan delinquencies (1) 0.48 % 0.77 % Nonaccrual loans 0.39 % 0.45 % Allowance for loan losses 0.39 % 0.52 % (1) Loan delinquencies include loans that are 30 days or more past due and other nonaccrual loans. The Company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale and securities held to maturity portfolios, whose fair values totaled $51.6 billion and $29.5 billion at December 31, 2013, respectively. These portfolios include U.S. agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, certificates of deposit, and other securities. U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. At December 31, 2013, with the exception of one corporate bond (with an amortized cost of $100 million) and certain non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, all securities in the available for sale and held to maturity portfolios were rated investment grade (defined as a rating equivalent to a Moody’s rating of “Baa” or higher, or a Standard & Poor’s rating of “BBB-” or higher). The one non-investment grade corporate bond, which matures in April 2014, was not considered other than temporarily impaired at December 31, 2013. Although the Company has recognized net impairment losses on certain 40 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, at December 31, 2013 the amortized cost of all non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities represented less than 1% of the securities available for sale and securities held to maturity portfolios. Schwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab’s client or a counterparty fails to meet its obligations to Schwab. Concentration Risk The Company has exposure to concentration risk when holding large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry. The fair value of the Company’s investments in mortgage-backed securities totaled $48.9 billion at December 31, 2013. Of these, $47.1 billion were issued by U.S. agencies and $1.8 billion were issued by private entities (non-agency securities). These U.S. agency and non-agency securities are included in securities available for sale and securities held to maturity. The fair value of the Company’s investments in corporate debt securities and commercial paper totaled $9.2 billion at December 31, 2013, with the majority issued by institutions in the financial services industry. These securities are included in securities available for sale, securities held to maturity, cash and cash equivalents, and other securities owned in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Issuer, geographic, and sector concentrations are controlled by established credit policy limits to each concentration type. The Company’s loans to banking clients include $7.3 billion of adjustable rate first lien residential real estate mortgage loans at December 31, 2013. The Company’s adjustable rate mortgages have initial fixed interest rates for three to ten years and interest rates that adjust annually thereafter. Approximately 40% of these mortgages consisted of loans with interest-only payment terms. The interest rates on approximately 70% of these interest-only loans are not scheduled to reset for three or more years. The Company’s mortgage loans do not include interest terms described as temporary introductory rates below current market rates. At December 31, 2013, 46% of the residential real estate mortgages and 51% of the HELOC balances were secured by properties which are located in California. The Company’s HELOC product has a 30-year loan term with an initial draw period of 10 years from the date of origination. After the initial draw period, the balance outstanding at such time is converted to a 20-year amortizing loan. The interest rate during the initial draw period and the 20-year amortizing period is a floating rate based on the prime rate plus a margin. The following table presents when current outstanding HELOCs will convert to amortizing loans: December 31, 2013 Balance Converted to amortizing loan as of period end $ 134 Within 1 year 227 > 1 year – 3 years 498 > 3 years – 5 years 1,185 > 5 years 997 Total $ 3,041 The Company also has exposure to concentration risk from its margin and securities lending activities collateralized by securities of a single issuer or industry. This concentration risk is mitigated by collateral arrangements that require the fair value of such collateral exceeds the amounts loaned. The Company has indirect exposure to U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral to secure its resale agreements. The Company’s primary credit exposure on these resale transactions is with its counterparty. The Company would have exposure to the U.S. Government and agency securities only in the event of the counterparty’s default on the resale agreements. The fair value of U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral for resale agreements totaled $14.3 billion at December 31, 2013. 41 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) European Holdings The Company has exposure to non-sovereign financial and non-financial institutions in Europe. The following table shows the balances of this exposure by each country in Europe in which the issuer or counterparty is domiciled. The Company has no direct exposure to sovereign governments in Europe. The Company does not have unfunded commitments to counterparties in Europe, nor does it have exposure as a result of credit default protection purchased or sold separately as of December 31, 2013. The determination of the domicile of exposure varies by the type of investment. For time deposits and certificates of deposit, the exposure is grouped in the country in which the financial institution is chartered under the regulatory framework of the European country. For asset-backed commercial paper, the exposure is grouped by the country of the sponsoring bank that provides the credit and liquidity support for such instruments. For corporate debt securities, the exposure is grouped by the country in which the issuer is domiciled. In situations in which the Company invests in a corporate debt security of a U.S. subsidiary of a European parent company, such holdings will be attributable to the European country only if significant reliance is placed on the European parent company for credit support underlying the security. For substantially all of the holdings listed below, the issuers or counterparties were financial institutions. All of the Company’s resale agreements, which are included in investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes, are collateralized by U.S. government securities.

At December 31, 2013, the Company had $261 million in investments in these Funds. Certain of the Funds’ positions include certificates of deposits, time deposits, commercial paper and corporate debt securities issued by counterparties in Europe. Management mitigates exposure to European holdings by employing a separate team of credit analysts that evaluate each issuer, counterparty, and country. Management monitors its exposure to European issuers by 1) performing risk assessments of the foreign countries, which include evaluating the size of the country and economy, currency trends, political landscape and the countries’ regulatory environment and developments; 2) performing ad hoc stress tests that evaluate the impact of sovereign governments’ debt write-downs on financial issuers and counterparties the Company has exposure to through its investments; 3) reviewing publicly available stress tests that are published by various regulators in the European market; 4) establishing credit and maturity limits by issuer; and 5) establishing and monitoring aggregate credit limits by geography and sector. 42 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Market Risk Market risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by the Company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices or market conditions. Included in market risk is interest rate risk, which is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movement of interest rates. For discussion of the Company’s market risk, see “Item 7A – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk arises from the inability to meet obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses. It is the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument. Limits and contingency funding scenarios have been established for the Company to support liquidity levels and quality during both expected and stressed scenarios. The Company seeks to maintain client confidence in its balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the firm to meet its obligations under both expected and stressed scenarios. See Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional detail on the Company’s liquidity requirements. Compliance Risk The Company faces significant compliance risk in its business, that is, the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, fines or penalties, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, or other regulatory requirements. Among other things, compliance risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for Company products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of the Company’s controls. The Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, including SROs. Such regulation is becoming increasingly extensive and complex, regulatory proceedings and sanctions against financial services firms continue to increase. The Company attempts to manage compliance risk through policies, procedures and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, client privacy, and employment policies. Despite the Company’s efforts to maintain an effective compliance program and internal controls, legal breaches and rule violations could result in reputational harm, significant losses and disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on the Company’s business activities. Legal Risk Legal risk is a consequence of operational failure – the risk of a claim for damages brought by clients, employees or other third parties, alleging error that amounts to a breach of legal requirements or other duties under law. The financial services industry is subject to substantial litigation risk, and the firm incurs legal claims in the ordinary course of business. Increased litigation costs or substantial legal liability relating to an extraordinary claim or incidence of claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial condition. For information about the Company’s legal risk, see “Item 1A – Risk Factors,” and “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 14. Commitments and Contingencies.” Capital Planning The capital plan considers significant risks to meeting the Company’s capital goals over time and through evolving economic, financial, and business environments. Internal guidelines are set, for both the Company and regulated subsidiaries, to ensure continued regulatory compliance as well as to meet expectations of investors and rating agencies. The capital plan also considers the potential effects of a sudden and sustained systemic economic downturn, idiosyncratic events which are uniquely impactful to the Company, and sensitivity analyses applied to significant assumptions that are either quantitative or qualitative in nature. The comprehensive Capital Contingency Plan was developed by the Company to 43 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) address the action plans for certain capital events with low probability, but high severity, that the Company might face. The Capital Contingency Plan is issued under the authority of the Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee and provides guidelines for sustained capital events. It does not specifically address every contingency, but is designed to provide a framework for responding to any capital stress. Capital forecasts are reviewed monthly at Capital Planning and Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee meetings and semi-annually at the Company’s Board of Directors meetings. Exceptions to internal guidelines are also reviewed at quarterly Global Risk Committee meetings. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company uses the market and income approaches to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, and to determine fair value disclosures. See “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and 16. Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities” for more information on the Company’s assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. When available, the Company uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. When utilizing market data with a bid-ask spread, the Company uses the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices do not exist, the Company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets. The Company generally obtains prices from at least three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value and may obtain up to five prices on assets with higher risk of limited observable information, such as non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. The Company’s primary independent pricing service provides prices based on observable trades and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar “to-be-issued” securities. The Company compares the prices obtained from its primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. The Company does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in a material difference in the recorded amounts. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company did not adjust prices received from the primary independent third-party pricing service. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. While the majority of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position and reported financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy. Other-than-Temporary Impairment of Securities Available for Sale and Securities Held to Maturity Management evaluates whether securities available for sale and securities held to maturity are other-than-temporarily impaired (OTTI) on a quarterly basis. Debt securities with unrealized losses are considered OTTI if the Company intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such security before any anticipated recovery. If management determines that a security is OTTI under these circumstances, the impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the entire difference between the amortized cost and the then-current fair value. A security is also OTTI if management does not expect to recover the amortized cost of the security. In this circumstance, the impairment recognized in earnings represents estimated credit loss, and is measured by the difference between the present 44 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost of the security. Management utilizes cash flow models to estimate the expected future cash flow from the securities and to estimate the credit loss. Expected cash flows are discounted using the security’s effective interest rate. The evaluation of whether the Company expects to recover the amortized cost of a security is inherently judgmental. The evaluation includes the assessment of several bond performance indicators including: the portion of the underlying loans that are delinquent (30 days, 60 days, 90+ days), in bankruptcy, in foreclosure or converted to real estate owned; the actual amount of loss incurred on the underlying loans in which the property has been foreclosed and sold; the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security available to absorb credit losses on the underlying loans; the current price and magnitude of the unrealized loss; and whether the Company has received all scheduled principal and interest payments. Management uses cash flow models to further assess the likelihood of other-than-temporary impairment for the Company’s non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. To develop the cash flow models, the Company uses forecasted loss severity, prepayment speeds (i.e. the rate at which the principal on underlying loans are paid down), and default rates over the securities’ expected remaining maturities. Valuation of Goodwill The Company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually, or whenever indications of impairment exist. Impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, resulting in an impairment charge for this excess. Adverse changes in the Company’s planned business operations such as unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit, or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the Company’s recorded goodwill. The Company’s annual goodwill impairment testing date is April 1st. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on April 1, 2013, management performed a qualitative assessment of each of the Company’s reporting units (generally defined as the Company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) and concluded that goodwill was not impaired. Allowance for Loan Losses The appropriateness of the allowance is reviewed quarterly by management, taking into consideration current economic conditions, the existing loan portfolio composition, past loss experience, and risks inherent in the portfolio. The methodology to establish an allowance for loan losses related to the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolio utilizes statistical models that estimate prepayments, defaults, and probable losses for the loan segments based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the segments. The methodology considers the effects of borrower behavior and a variety of factors including, but not limited to, interest rates, housing price movements as measured by a housing price index, economic conditions, estimated defaults and foreclosures measured by historical and expected delinquencies, changes in prepayment speeds, LTV ratios, past loss experience, estimates of future loss severities, borrower credit risk measured by FICO scores, and the adequacy of collateral. The methodology also evaluates concentrations in the loan segments including loan products, year of origination, and geographical distribution of collateral. Probable losses are forecast using a loan-level simulation of the delinquency status of the loans over the term of the loans. The simulation starts with the current relevant risk indicators, including the current delinquent status of each loan, the estimated current LTV ratio of each loan, the term and structure of each loan, current key interest rates including U.S. Treasury and London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rates, and borrower FICO scores. The more significant variables in the simulation include delinquency roll rates, loss severity, housing prices, and interest rates. Delinquency roll rates (i.e., the rates at which loans transition through delinquency stages and ultimately result in a loss) are estimated from the Company’s historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information. Further, the delinquency roll rates within the loan-level simulation discussed above are calibrated to match a moving average of the delinquency roll rates actually experienced in the respective First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios. Loss severity estimates are based on the Company’s historical loss experience and market trends. The estimated loss severity (i.e. loss given default) used in the allowance for loan loss methodology for HELOCs is higher than that used in the methodology for First Mortgages. Housing price trends are 45 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values. Factors affecting the home price index include: housing inventory, unemployment, interest rates, and inflation expectations. Interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths. As a result, the current state of house prices and the current state of delinquencies unique to the Company’s First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios are considered in the allowance for loan loss methodology. This methodology results in loss factors that are applied to the outstanding balances to determine the allowance for loan loss for each loan segment. The allowance for personal loans secured by securities is established on a loan by loan basis. The market value of collateral pledged by borrowers is regularly reviewed to ensure the Company’s commitment to extend credit is over-collateralized. If collateral is in danger of falling below specified levels, the Company may reduce a borrower’s committed line or may liquidate collateral. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the allowance for loan losses related to personal loans secured by securities was immaterial. Legal and Regulatory Reserves Reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, insurance coverage and indemnification, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved. The Company’s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee. Additionally, management has reviewed with the Audit Committee the Company’s significant estimates discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Certain of these factors, as well as general risk factors affecting the Company, are discussed in greater detail in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Item 1A – Risk Factors.” 47 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by the Company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices or market conditions. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on its interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources that finance these assets. The majority of the Company’s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. To a lesser degree, the Company is sensitive to changes in long-term interest rates through some of its investment portfolios. To manage the Company’s market risk related to interest rates, management utilizes simulation models, which include the net interest revenue sensitivity analysis described below. Net interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may reprice at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short and long-term interest rates. Interest-earning assets include residential real estate loans and mortgage-backed securities. These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and to changes to prepayment levels, which tend to increase in a declining rate environment. Because the Company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients and the rates charged on margin loans and loans to banking clients, and controls the composition of its investment securities, it has some ability to manage its net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions. To mitigate the risk of loss, the Company has established policies and procedures that include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk, and monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interest-earning assets and funding sources. To remain within these guidelines, the Company manages the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios. The Company is also subject to market risk as a result of fluctuations in option and equity prices. The Company’s direct holdings of option and equity securities and its associated exposure to option and equity prices are not material. The Company is indirectly exposed to option and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option accounts, securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers, and customer securities loaned out as part of the Company’s securities lending activities. Equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity, margin borrowing, and overall client engagement with the Company. Additionally, the Company earns mutual fund service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets. Fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue earned by the Company. Financial instruments held by the Company are also subject to liquidity risk – that is, the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument. Recent conditions in the credit markets have significantly reduced market liquidity in a wide range of financial instruments, including certain instruments held by the Company, and fair value can differ significantly from the value implied by the credit quality and actual performance of the instrument’s underlying cash flows. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue, see “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Current Market and Regulatory Environment and Other Developments.” The Company’s market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material. Net Interest Revenue Simulation For the Company’s net interest revenue sensitivity analysis, the Company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulation includes all interest-sensitive assets and liabilities. Key variables in the simulation include the repricing of financial instruments, prepayment, reinvestment, and product pricing assumptions. The Company uses constant balances and market rates in the simulation assumptions in order to 48 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION minimize the number of variables and to better isolate risks. The simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies, including changes in asset and liability mix. If the Company’s guidelines for its net interest revenue sensitivity are breached, management must report the breach to the Company’s Corporate Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee (Corporate ALCO) and establish a plan to address the interest rate risk. This plan could include, but is not limited to, rebalancing certain investment portfolios or using derivative instruments to mitigate the interest rate risk. Depending on the severity and expected duration of the breach, as well as the then current interest rate environment, the plan could also be to take no action. Any plan that recommends taking action is required to be approved by the Company’s Corporate ALCO. There were no breaches of the Company’s net interest revenue sensitivity guidelines during the years ending December 31, 2013 or 2012. As represented by the simulations presented below, the Company’s investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall. The simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As the Company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood the Company would take steps to manage any additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment. The following table shows the results of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to the Company’s current market rates forecast on simulated net interest revenue over the next 12 months beginning December 31, 2013 and 2012. December 31, 2013 2012 Increase of 100 basis points 11.0 % 19.2 % Decrease of 100 basis points (4.5) % (10.0) % The sensitivities shown in the simulation reflect the fact that short-term interest rates in 2013 remained at historically low levels, including the federal funds target rate, which was unchanged at a range of zero to 0.25%. The year-over-year decrease in net interest income sensitivity reflects the baseline assumption of higher medium and longer-term rates at December 31, 2013 relative to those assumed at December 31, 2012 resulting in a higher basis for comparison. The current low interest rate environment limits the extent to which the Company can reduce interest expense paid on funding sources in a declining interest rate scenario. A decline in interest rates could therefore negatively impact the yield on the Company’s investment portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense, further compressing net interest margin. Any increases in short-term interest rates result in a greater impact as yields on interest-earning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources. 49 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION",2023-12-30 18:56:43.311157

Management believes that net revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin, earnings per common share, and return on common stockholders’ equity provide broad indicators of the Company’s overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns within the context of a given operating environment. Expenses excluding interest as a percentage of average client assets is considered by management to be a measure of operating efficiency. Results for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 are: Growth Rate 1-Year Year Ended December 31, 2013-2014 2014 2013 2012 Client Metrics: Net new client assets (1) (in billions) N/M $ 124.8 $ 41.6 $ 139.7 Client assets (2) (in billions, at year end) 10 % $ 2,463.6 $ 2,249.4 $ 1,951.6 New brokerage accounts (3) (in thousands) 1 % 972 960 900 Active brokerage accounts (4) (in thousands, at year end) 3 % 9,386 9,093 8,787 Assets receiving ongoing advisory services (5) (in billions, at year end) 12 % $ 1,228.1 $ 1,101.4 $ 915.2 Client cash as a percentage of client assets (6) (at year end) 12.3 % 13.1 % 14.7 % Company Financial Metrics: Net revenues 11 % $ 6,058 $ 5,435 $ 4,883 Expenses excluding interest 6 % 3,943 3,730 3,433 Income before taxes on income 24 % 2,115 1,705 1,450 Taxes on income 25 % 794 634 522 Net income 23 % $ 1,321 $ 1,071 $ 928 Preferred stock dividends (2) % 60 61 45 Net income available to common stockholders 25 % $ 1,261 $ 1,010 $ 883 Earnings per common share – diluted 22 % $ .95 $ .78 $ .69 Net revenue growth from prior year 11 % 11 % 4 % Pre-tax profit margin 34.9 % 31.4 % 29.7 % Return on average common stockholders’ equity (7) 12 % 11 % 11 % Expenses excluding interest as a percentage of average client assets 0.17 % 0.18 % 0.19 % (1) Net new client assets is defined as the total inflows of client cash and securities to the firm less client outflows. Management believes that this metric, along with core net new assets, depicts how well the Company’s products and services appeal to new and existing clients. Core net new assets totaled $124.8 billion, $140.8 billion, and $112.4 billion in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. See below for items excluded from core net new assets. (2) Client assets represent the market value of all client assets custodied at the Company. Management considers client assets to be indicative of the Company’s appeal in the marketplace. Additionally, fluctuations in certain components of client assets (e.g., Mutual Fund OneSource® funds) directly impact asset management and administration fees. (3) New brokerage accounts include all brokerage accounts opened during the period, as well as any accounts added via acquisition. This metric measures the Company’s effectiveness in attracting new clients and building stronger relationships with existing clients. (4) Active brokerage accounts include accounts with balances or activity within the preceding eight months. This metric is an indicator of the Company’s success in both attracting and retaining clients. (5) Assets receiving ongoing advisory services include relationships under the guidance of independent advisors and assets enrolled in one of the Company’s retail or other advisory solutions. This metric depicts how well the Company’s advisory products and services appeal to new and existing clients. (6) Client cash as a percentage of client assets includes Schwab One®, certain cash equivalents, deposits from banking clients and money market fund balances, as a percentage of client assets. This measure is an indicator of clients’ engagement in the fixed income and equity markets. (7) Calculated as net income available to common stockholders divided by average common stockholders’ equity. N/M Not meaningful. - 20 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Core net new client assets is defined as net new client assets before significant one-time flows. Management considers this to be a useful metric when comparing period-to-period client asset flows. The following one-time flows were excluded from core net new assets. · 2013 excludes outflows of $74.5 billion relating to the planned transfer of a mutual fund clearing services client. The Company also reduced its reported total for overall client assets by $24.7 billion in 2013 to reflect the estimated impact of the consolidation of its retirement plan recordkeeping technology platforms and subsequent resignation from certain retirement plan clients. · 2012 excludes inflows of $27.7 billion from mutual fund clearing services clients and $900 million from the acquisition of ThomasPartners, Inc., and outflows of $1.3 billion from the closure and/or sale of certain subsidiaries of optionsXpress. The Company’s major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue. The Company generates asset management and administration fees through its proprietary and third-party mutual fund offerings, as well as fee-based advisory solutions. Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources, the majority of which is derived from client cash balances. Asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue are impacted by securities valuations, interest rates, the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing funding sources, the Company’s ability to attract new clients, and client activity levels. The Company generates trading revenue through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenue primarily from trading activity in client fixed income securities. Trading revenue is impacted by trading volumes, the volatility of prices in the equity and fixed income markets, and commission rates. 2014 Compared to 2013 The Company operated in an environment of mixed market conditions during 2014 compared to 2013, as the Nasdaq Composite Index, Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, and Dow Jones Industrial Average showed periods of volatility before ending the year up 13%, 11%, and 8%, respectively. The federal funds target rate remained unchanged at a range of zero to 0.25% during 2014. The average 10-year Treasury yield increased by 20 basis points to 2.53% during 2014 compared to 2013, while the yield ended the year down 86 basis points to 2.17%. In the same period, the average three-month Treasury Bill yield decreased by 3 basis points to 0.02%. The Company’s steady focus on serving investor needs through its full-service investing model continued to drive growth during 2014. Total client assets ended the year at $2.46 trillion, up 10% from 2013, reflecting net new client assets of $124.8 billion and a rising equity market environment. In addition, the Company added almost 1 million new brokerage accounts to its client base during 2014. Active brokerage accounts reached 9.4 million in 2014, up 3% from 2013. As a result of the Company’s strong key client activity metrics, the Company achieved a pre-tax profit margin of 34.9% in 2014. Overall, net income increased by 23% in 2014 from 2013 and the return on average common stockholders’ equity was 12% in 2014. Overall, net revenues increased by 11% in 2014 from 2013, primarily due to increases in net interest revenue, asset management and administration fees, and other revenue – net. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher balances of interest-earning assets, including margin loans and the Company’s investment portfolio (securities available for sale and securities held to maturity), and the effect higher average interest rates on securities held to maturity had on the Company’s average net interest margin. Asset management and administration fees increased due to fees from mutual fund services, advice solutions, and other asset management and administration services. Other revenue – net increased primarily due to a net insurance settlement of $45 million, net litigation proceeds of $28 million related to the Company’s non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio, and increases in order flow revenue. Expenses excluding interest increased by 6% in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense as a result of a charge of $68 million for estimated future severance benefits resulting from changes in the Company’s geographic footprint and an increase in professional services expense. - 21 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) 2013 Compared to 2012 Valuations in the broad equity markets improved during 2013 compared to 2012, as the Nasdaq Composite Index, Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, and Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 38%, 30%, and 26%, respectively. While the federal funds target rate remained unchanged at a range of zero to 0.25%, the average 10-year Treasury yield increased by 55 basis points to 2.33% during 2013 compared to 2012. In the same period however, the average three-month Treasury Bill yield decreased by 3 basis points to 0.05%. The Company continued to experience growth in its client base during 2013 – core net new client assets totaled $140.8 billion, up 25% from $112.4 billion in 2012. Total client assets ended the year at a record $2.25 trillion, up 15% from 2012. In addition, the Company added almost 1 million new brokerage accounts during 2013, and active brokerage accounts reached 9.1 million, up 3% from 2012. As a result of the Company’s strong key client activity metrics, the Company achieved a pre-tax profit margin of 31.4% in 2013. Overall, net income increased by 15% in 2013 from 2012 and the return on average common stockholders’ equity was 11% in 2013. Along with the growth in its client base, enrollments in client advisory solutions and stability in the economic environment helped the Company achieve increases in all three major revenue lines in 2013 compared to 2012. Overall, net revenues increased by 11% in 2013 from 2012, primarily due to increases in asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue, partially offset by a decrease in other revenue – net. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to increases in mutual fund service fees and advice solutions fees. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher balances of interest-earning assets and higher interest rates on new fixed-rate investments. This increase was partially offset by the effect lower average short-term interest rates and the maturity of short-term interest-earning assets had on the Company’s average net interest margin. Trading revenue increased primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades and two additional trading days during the year. Other revenue – net decreased primarily due to a non-recurring gain of $70 million relating to a confidential resolution of a vendor dispute in 2012. Expenses excluding interest increased by 9% in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits, professional services, advertising and market development, and other expense. Compensation and benefits expense increased in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to higher incentive compensation relating to the transition to a new payout schedule for field incentive plans, increased individual sales performance compensation as a result of field sales volume, increased and accelerated health savings account (HSA) contributions, equity incentive plan changes to vesting for retirement-eligible employees, and increased funding for the corporate bonus plan commensurate with achieving higher earnings per common share. Advertising and market development expense increased primarily due to investment in the Company’s new advertising and branding initiative, Own your tomorrow™. CURRENT MARKET AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS To the extent short-term interest rates remain at current low levels, the Company’s net interest revenue will continue to be constrained, even as growth in average balances helps to increase such revenue. The low short-term interest rate environment also affects asset management and administration fees. The Company continues to waive a portion of its management fees, as the overall yields on certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds have remained at levels at or below the management fees on those funds. These and certain other Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds may not be able to replace maturing securities with securities of equal or higher yields. As a result, the yields on such funds may remain around or decline from their current levels, and therefore below the stated management fees on those funds. To the extent this occurs, asset management and administration fees may continue to be negatively affected. In July 2013, the U.S. banking agencies issued regulatory capital rules that implemented BASEL III and relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (Final Regulatory Capital Rules), which are applicable to savings and loan holding companies, such as CSC, and federal savings banks, such as Schwab Bank. The implementation of the rules began on January 1, 2015. The - 22 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Company does not expect the Final Regulatory Capital Rules to have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. The Final Regulatory Capital Rules, among other things: · subject savings and loan holding companies to consolidated capital requirements; · revise the required minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements by (1) establishing a new minimum Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio (common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets) of 4.5%; (2) raising the minimum Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio from 4.0% to 6.0%; (3) maintaining the minimum Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 8.0%; and (4) maintaining a minimum Tier 1 Leverage Ratio (Tier 1 capital to adjusted average consolidated assets) of 4.0%; · add a requirement to maintain a minimum capital conservation buffer, composed of common equity Tier 1 capital, of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, which means that banking organizations, on a fully phased-in basis no later than January 1, 2019, must maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio greater than 7.0%; a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio greater than 8.5% and a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio greater than 10.5%; and · change the definition of capital categories for insured depository: to be considered “well-capitalized”, Schwab Bank must have a Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of at least 8%, a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of at least 10% and a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of at least 5%. The new minimum regulatory capital ratios and changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets were effective beginning January 1, 2015. The required minimum capital conservation buffer will be phased in incrementally, starting at 0.625% on January 1, 2016 and increasing to 1.25% on January 1, 2017, 1.875% on January 1, 2018 and 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The Final Regulatory Capital Rules provide that the failure to maintain the minimum capital conservation buffer will result in restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers. In September 2014, the Federal Reserve, in collaboration with the OCC and the FDIC, issued a rule implementing a quantitative liquidity requirement generally consistent with the LCR standard established by Basel III. The LCR applies to all internationally active banking organizations. The Federal Reserve also issued a modified LCR that applies to the Company. Under the modified LCR, a depository institution holding company is required to maintain high-quality liquid assets in an amount related to its total estimated net cash outflows over a prospective period. The modified LCR will be phased in beginning on January 1, 2016, with a minimum requirement of 90%, increasing to 100% at January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the final rule but does not expect a material impact to the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. The Company is pursuing lawsuits in state court in San Francisco for rescission and damages against issuers, underwriters, and dealers of individual non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities on which the Company has experienced realized and unrealized losses. The lawsuits allege that offering documents for the securities contained material untrue and misleading statements about the securities and the underwriting standards and credit quality of the underlying loans. On January 27, 2012, and July 24, 2012, the court denied defendants’ motions to dismiss the claims and discovery is proceeding. To date, the Company has realized $28 million in net settlement proceeds on such claims, and an initial trial date relating to certain of the defendants who remain in the case is set for August 2015. - 23 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion is an analysis of the Company’s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012. Net Revenues The Company’s major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue. Asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue increased, while trading revenue remained relatively flat in 2014 as compared to 2013. Asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue all increased in 2013 as compared to 2012.

The Company earns mutual fund service fees for shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. These fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in these funds. The Company also earns asset management fees for advice solutions, which include advisory and managed account services that are based on the daily balances of client assets subject to the specific fee for service. The fair values of client assets included in proprietary and third-party mutual funds are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data. Other asset management and administration fees include various asset based fees, such as third-party mutual fund service fees, trust fees, 401(k) record keeping fees, and mutual fund clearing and other service fees. Asset management and administration fees vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity. For a discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees, see “Current Market and Regulatory Environment and Other Developments.” Asset management and administration fees increased by $218 million, or 9%, in 2014 from 2013 due to fees from mutual fund services, advice solutions, and other asset management and administration services. Asset management and - 24 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) administration fees increased by $272 million, or 13%, in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to fees from mutual fund services and advice solutions. Mutual fund service fees increased by $44 million, or 4%, in 2014 from 2013 and by $84 million, or 8%, in 2013 from 2012, due to growth in client assets invested in the Company’s Mutual Fund OneSource funds and equity and bond funds, partially offset by a decrease in net money market mutual fund fees as a result of continued low yields on fund assets. Advice solutions fees increased by $122 million, or 17%, in 2014 from 2013 due to growth in client assets enrolled in advisory offers, including Schwab Private Client™, ThomasPartners®, and Schwab Managed Portfolios™. Advice solutions fees increased by $138 million, or 24%, in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to growth in client assets enrolled in advisory offers, including Windhaven®, Schwab Private Client™, and ThomasPartners®. Other asset management and administration fees increased by $52 million, or 13%, in 2014 from 2013 and $50 million, or 14%, in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to third-party mutual fund service fees on higher client asset balances invested in other third-party mutual funds. Net Interest Revenue Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies. The majority of the Company’s interest-earnings assets and interest-bearing liabilities are sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. The Company’s investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall, from current levels. When interest rates fall, the Company may attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending the maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lock in asset yields, and by lowering rates paid to clients on interest-bearing liabilities. Since the Company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients, as well as the rates charged on receivables from brokerage clients, and also controls the composition of its investment securities, it has some ability to manage its net interest spread. However, the spread is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition. The current low interest rate environment limits the extent to which the Company can reduce interest expense paid on funding sources. To a lesser degree, the Company is sensitive to changes in long-term interest rates through some of its investment portfolios. To mitigate the related risk, the Company may alter the types of investments purchased. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on net interest revenue, see “Current Market and Regulatory Environment and Other Developments.” The Company’s interest-earning assets are financed primarily by brokerage client cash balances and Schwab Bank deposits. Non-interest-bearing funding sources include non-interest-bearing brokerage client cash balances, stockholders’ equity, and proceeds from stock-lending activities. Revenue from stock-lending activities is included in other interest revenue. Schwab Bank maintains available for sale and held to maturity investment portfolios for liquidity as well as to earn interest by investing funds from deposits that are in excess of loans to banking clients and liquidity requirements. Schwab Bank lends funds to banking clients primarily in the form of mortgage loans, HELOCs, and personal loans secured by securities. These loans are largely funded by interest-bearing deposits from banking clients. In clearing their clients’ trades, Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. hold cash balances payable to clients. In most cases, Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. pay their clients interest on cash balances awaiting investment, and in turn invest these funds and earn interest revenue. Receivables from brokerage clients consist primarily of margin loans to brokerage clients. Margin loans are loans made to clients on a secured basis to purchase securities. Pursuant to applicable regulations, client cash balances that are not used for margin lending are generally segregated into investment accounts that are maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients, which are recorded in cash and investments segregated on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. When investing segregated client cash balances, Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. must adhere to applicable regulations that restrict investments to securities guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, participation certificates, mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association, deposits held at U.S. - 25 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) banks and thrifts, and resale agreements collateralized by qualified securities.

(2) Amounts have been calculated based on amortized cost. (3) Includes the impact of capitalizing interest on building construction and software development. Net interest revenue increased in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to higher balances of interest-earning assets, including margin loans and the Company’s investment portfolio, and the effect higher average interest rates on securities held to maturity had on the Company’s average net interest margin. The growth in the average balance of deposits from banking clients funded the increase in the balances of securities held to maturity and securities available for sale. Net interest revenue increased in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to higher balances of interest-earning assets and higher interest rates on new fixed-rate investments, including securities available for sale and securities held to maturity, partially offset by the effect lower average short-term interest rates and the maturity of short-term interest-earning assets had on the Company’s average net interest margin. The growth in the average balance of deposits from banking clients funded the increase in the balance of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity. Net interest revenue also increased due to the redemption of higher rate trust preferred securities and the exchange of higher rate Senior Notes during the third quarter of 2012. Trading Revenue Trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenue is affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. Principal transaction revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from trading activity in client fixed income securities. To accommodate clients’ fixed income trading activity, the Company maintains positions in fixed income securities, including state and municipal debt obligations, U.S. Government, corporate debt, and other securities. The difference between the price at which the Company buys and sells securities to and from its clients and other broker-dealers is recognized as principal transaction revenue. Principal transaction - 26 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) revenue also includes adjustments to the fair value of these securities positions. Factors that influence principal transaction revenue include the volume of client trades and market price volatility. Trading revenue remained relatively flat in 2014 from 2013. Trading revenue increased by $45 million, or 5%, in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades and two additional trading days in 2013. Daily average revenue trades were relatively flat in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to a higher volume of equity trades, offset by a lower volume of mutual fund trades. Daily average revenue trades increased by 4% in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to a higher volume of equity and mutual fund trades, partially offset by a lower volume of future and option trades. Average revenue per revenue trade remained relatively flat from 2012 to 2014. Growth Rate Year Ended December 31, 2013-2014 2014 2013 2012 Daily average revenue trades (1) (in thousands) 1 % 298.2 295.0 282.7 Clients’ daily average trades (2) (in thousands) 5 % 516.8 490.5 440.9 Number of trading days (3) - 250.5 250.5 248.5 Average revenue per revenue trade (1) % $ 12.13 $ 12.31 $ 12.35 (1) Includes all client trades that generate trading revenue (i.e., commission revenue or principal transaction revenue). (2) Includes daily average revenue trades, trades by clients in asset-based pricing relationships, and all commission-free trades, including the Company’s Mutual Fund OneSource funds and ETFs, and other proprietary products. Clients’ daily average trades is an indicator of client engagement with securities markets. (3) October 29 and 30, 2012, were not included as trading days due to weather-related market closures. Other Revenue – Net Other revenue – net includes order flow revenue, nonrecurring gains, software fees from the Company’s portfolio management services, exchange processing fees, realized gains or losses on sales of securities available for sale, and other service fees. Other revenue – net increased by $107 million, or 45%, in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to a net insurance settlement of $45 million, net litigation proceeds of $28 million related to the Company’s non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio, and increases in order flow revenue. Other revenue – net decreased by $20 million, or 8%, in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to a non-recurring gain of $70 million relating to a confidential resolution of a vendor dispute in the second quarter of 2012 and realized gains of $35 million from the sales of securities available for sale in 2012, partially offset by an increase in order flow revenue that Schwab began receiving in November 2012. Provision for Loan Losses The provision for loan losses decreased by $3 million in 2014, from $(1) million to $(4) million in 2013 and 2014, respectively, primarily due to improved residential real estate mortgage and HELOC credit quality in the Company’s loan portfolio. Charge-offs were $5 million, $11 million, and $16 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. For further discussion on the Company’s credit risk and the allowance for loan losses, see “Risk Management – Credit Risk” and “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 6. Loans to Banking Clients and Related Allowance for Loan Losses.” Net Impairment Losses on Securities Net impairment losses on securities were $1 million, $10 million, and $32 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. These charges were lower in 2014 compared to 2013, reflecting a stabilization of the credit characteristics of certain non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities’ underlying loans. For further discussion, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements - 27 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 5. Securities Available for Sale and Securities Held to Maturity.” Expenses Excluding Interest As shown in the table below, expenses excluding interest were higher in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits and professional services expense. Expenses excluding interest were higher in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits, professional services, advertising and market development, and other expense. Growth Rate Year Ended December 31, 2013-2014 2014 2013 2012 Compensation and benefits 8 % $ 2,184 $ 2,027 $ 1,803 Professional services 10 % 457 415 388 Occupancy and equipment 5 % 324 309 311 Advertising and market development (5) % 245 257 241 Communications 1 % 223 220 220 Depreciation and amortization (1) % 199 202 196 Other 4 % 311 300 274 Total expenses excluding interest 6 % $ 3,943 $ 3,730 $ 3,433 Expenses as a percentage of total net revenues: Compensation and benefits 36 % 37 % 37 % Advertising and market development 4 % 5 % 5 % Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits expense includes salaries and wages, incentive compensation, and related employee benefits and taxes. Incentive compensation includes variable compensation, discretionary bonuses, and stock-based compensation. Variable compensation includes payments to certain individuals based on their sales performance. Discretionary bonuses are based on the Company’s overall performance as measured by earnings per common share, and therefore will fluctuate with this measure. Stock-based compensation primarily includes employee and board of director stock options and restricted stock. The following table shows a comparison of certain compensation and benefits components and employee data: Growth Rate Year Ended December 31, 2013-2014 2014 2013 2012 Salaries and wages 12 % $ 1,245 $ 1,110 $ 1,043 Incentive compensation 1 % 605 599 466 Employee benefits and other 5 % 334 318 294 Total compensation and benefits expense 8 % $ 2,184 $ 2,027 $ 1,803 Full-time equivalent employees (in thousands) (1) At year end 6 % 14.6 13.8 13.8 Average 2 % 14.2 13.9 13.8 (1) Includes full-time, part-time and temporary employees, and persons employed on a contract basis, and excludes employees of outsourced service providers. Salaries and wages increased in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to a $68 million charge in 2014 for estimated future severance benefits resulting from changes in the Company’s geographic footprint and due to annual salary increases. Incentive compensation was relatively flat in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to an increase in discretionary bonus costs, offset by higher 2013 expense related to a new payout schedule for field incentive plans. - 28 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Salaries and wages increased in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to annual salary increases. Incentive compensation increased in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to the transition to a new payout schedule for field incentive plans, increased individual sales performance compensation as a result of higher field sales volume, and increased funding for the corporate bonus plan commensurate with achieving higher earnings per common share. Employee benefits and other expense increased in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to payroll taxes related to the increase in incentive compensation, and increased contributions to new employee HSAs. The Company was converting to HSA-based healthcare and employee enrollment in these plans rose significantly in 2013. Expenses Excluding Compensation and Benefits Professional services expense increased in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to higher spending on technology services and an increase in fees paid to outsourced service providers and consultants. Professional services expense increased in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to an increase in fees paid to outsourced service providers and consultants and higher spending on printing and fulfillment services. Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to an increase in software maintenance expense relating to the Company’s information technology systems. Occupancy and equipment expense was relatively flat in 2013 compared to 2012. Advertising and market development expense decreased in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to production costs incurred in 2013 relating to the development of the Company’s advertising and branding initiative, Own your tomorrowTM, partially offset by higher 2014 spending on customer promotions. Advertising and market development expense increased in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to higher spending on media relating to the launch of the Company’s new advertising and branding initiative, Own your tomorrowTM. Other expense increased in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to an increase in travel costs as a result of increased employee headcount and travel. Other expense increased in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to an increase in regulatory assessments. Taxes on Income The Company’s effective income tax rate on income before taxes was 37.5% in 2014, 37.2% in 2013, and 36.0% in 2012. The increase in 2014 from 2013 was primarily due to the impact of a non-recurring state tax benefit of $4 million from 2013. The increase in 2013 from 2012 was primarily due to the impact of a non-recurring state tax benefit of $20 million in 2012, partially offset by the recognition of the additional state tax benefit of $4 million in 2013. Segment Information The Company provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments – Investor Services and Advisor Services. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services to individual investors, retirement plan services, and corporate brokerage services. The Advisor Services segment provides custodial, trading, and support services to independent investment advisors, and retirement business services to independent retirement plan advisors and recordkeepers whose plan assets are held at Schwab Bank. Banking revenues and expenses are allocated to the Company’s two segments based on which segment services the client. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments on a pre-tax basis, excluding items such as significant nonrecurring gains, impairment charges on non-financial assets, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and significant restructuring and other charges. Segment assets and liabilities are not used for evaluating segment performance or in deciding how to allocate resources to segments. - 29 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Financial information for the Company’s reportable segments is presented in the following tables: Investor Services Advisor Services Growth Rate Growth Rate Year Ended December 31, 2013-2014 2014 2013 2012 2013-2014 2014 2013 2012 Net Revenues Asset management and administration fees 9 % $ 1,775 $ 1,627 $ 1,436 10 % $ 758 $ 689 $ 607 Net interest revenue 16 % 2,030 1,756 1,559 8 % 242 224 205 Trading revenue - 618 621 612 (1) % 289 292 255 Other – net 24 % 221 178 123 25 % 71 57 62 Provision for loan losses N/M 4 1 (15) - - - (1) Net impairment losses on securities (89) % (1) (9) (29) (100) % - (1) (3) Total net revenues 11 % 4,647 4,174 3,686 8 % 1,360 1,261 1,125 Expenses Excluding Interest 3 % 2,974 2,899 2,693 8 % 901 831 739 Income before taxes on income 31 % $ 1,673 $ 1,275 $ 993 7 % $ 459 $ 430 $ 386 Unallocated Total Growth Rate Growth Rate Year Ended December 31, 2013-2014 2014 2013 2012 2013-2014 2014 2013 2012 Net Revenues Asset management and administration fees N/M $ - $ (1) $ - 9 % $ 2,533 $ 2,315 $ 2,043 Net interest revenue N/M - - - 15 % 2,272 1,980 1,764 Trading revenue N/M - - 1 (1) % 907 913 868 Other – net N/M 51 1 71 45 % 343 236 256 Provision for loan losses N/M - - - N/M 4 1 (16) Net impairment losses on securities N/M - - - (90) % (1) (10) (32) Total net revenues N/M 51 - 72 11 % 6,058 5,435 4,883 Expenses Excluding Interest N/M 68 - 1 6 % 3,943 3,730 3,433 Income before taxes on income N/M $ (17) $ - $ 71 24 % $ 2,115 $ 1,705 $ 1,450 N/M Not meaningful. Investor Services Net revenues increased by $473 million, or 11%, in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue, asset management and administration fees, and other revenue – net. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher balances of interest-earning assets, including margin loans and the Company’s investment portfolio, and the effect higher average interest rates on securities held to maturity had on the Company’s average net interest margin. Asset management and administration fees increased due to fees from mutual fund services, advice solutions, and other asset management and administration services. Mutual fund service fees increased due to growth in client assets invested in the Company’s Mutual Fund OneSource funds and equity and bond funds, partially offset by a decrease in net money market mutual fund fees as a result of continued low yields on fund assets. Advice solution fees increased due to growth in client assets enrolled in advisory offers. Other asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to third-party mutual fund service fees on higher client asset balances invested in other third-party mutual funds. Other revenue – net increased primarily due to litigation proceeds related to the Company’s non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio and increases in - 30 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) order flow revenue. Expenses excluding interest increased by $75 million, or 3%, in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits and professional services expense, partially offset by a decrease in advertising and market development expense. Net revenues increased by $488 million, or 13%, in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue, asset management and administration fees, and other revenue. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the effect lower average short-term interest rates had on the Company’s average net interest margin. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to increases in advice solutions fees and mutual fund service fees. Advice solutions fees increased due to growth in client assets enrolled in advisory offers, including Windhaven and Schwab Private Client. Mutual fund service fees increased due to market appreciation and growth in client assets invested in the Company’s Mutual Fund OneSource funds, and equity and bond funds, partially offset by a decrease in net money market mutual fund fees as a result of lower yields on fund assets. Other revenue – net increased primarily due to an increase in order flow revenue that Schwab began receiving in November 2012. Expenses excluding interest increased by $206 million, or 8%, in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits, professional services, advertising and market development, and other expenses.

Mutual fund service fees increased due to market appreciation and growth in client assets invested in the Company’s Mutual Fund OneSource funds, and equity and bond funds. Advice solutions fees increased due to growth in client assets enrolled in advisory offers. Trading revenue increased primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades and two additional trading days in 2013. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the effect lower average short-term interest rates had on the Company’s average net interest margin. Expenses excluding interest increased by $92 million, or 12%, in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits, professional services, advertising and market development expenses, and other expenses. Unallocated Other revenue – net in 2014 includes a net insurance settlement of $45 million. Other revenue – net in 2012 includes a non-recurring gain of $70 million relating to a confidential resolution of a vendor dispute.

The Company’s capital structure is designed to provide each subsidiary with capital and liquidity to meet its operational needs and regulatory requirements. CSC is a savings and loan holding company and Schwab Bank, CSC’s depository institution, is a federal savings bank. CSC is subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve and Schwab Bank is subject to supervision and regulation by the OCC. Liquidity CSC CSC’s liquidity needs arise from funding its subsidiaries’ operations, including margin and mortgage lending, and transaction settlement, in addition to funding cash dividends, acquisitions, investments, short- and long-term debt, and managing statutory capital requirements. CSC’s liquidity needs are generally met through cash generated by its subsidiaries, as well as cash provided by external financing. CSC has a universal automatic shelf registration statement (Shelf Registration Statement) on file with the SEC which enables CSC to issue debt, equity, and other securities. CSC maintains excess liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments to cover daily funding needs and to support growth in the Company’s business. Generally, CSC does not hold liquidity at its subsidiaries in excess of amounts deemed sufficient to support the subsidiaries’ operations, including any regulatory capital requirements. Schwab, Schwab Bank, and optionsXpress, Inc. are subject to regulatory requirements that may restrict them from certain transactions with CSC, as further discussed below. Management believes that funds generated by the operations of CSC’s subsidiaries will continue to be the primary funding source in meeting CSC’s liquidity needs, providing adequate liquidity to meet Schwab Bank’s capital guidelines, and maintaining Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc.’s net capital. On July 25, 2013, CSC issued $275 million of Senior Notes that mature in 2018 under its Shelf Registration Statement. The Senior Notes have a fixed interest rate of 2.20% with interest payable semi-annually. CSC is required to serve as a source of strength for Schwab Bank and must have the ability to provide financial assistance if Schwab Bank experiences financial distress. To manage capital adequacy, the Company currently utilizes a target Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for CSC, as currently defined by the Federal Reserve, of at least 6%. At December 31, 2014, CSC’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 6.9%, Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 18.0%, and Total Capital Ratio was 18.1%. Prior to January 1, 2015, CSC, as a savings and loan holding company, was not subject to specific statutory capital requirements. Beginning on January 1, 2015, CSC is subject to new capital requirements set by the Federal Reserve. The following are details of CSC’s long-term debt: Par Standard December 31, 2014 Outstanding Maturity Interest Rate Moody’s & Poor’s Fitch Senior Notes $ 1,581 2015 – 2022 0.850% to 4.45% fixed A2 A A Medium-Term Notes $ 250 2017 6.375% fixed A2 A A CSC has authorization from its Board of Directors to issue unsecured commercial paper notes (Commercial Paper Notes) not to exceed $1.5 billion. Management has set a current limit for the commercial paper program of $800 million. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes may vary, but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper is not redeemable prior to maturity and cannot be voluntarily prepaid. The proceeds of the commercial paper program are to be used for general corporate purposes. There were no borrowings of Commercial Paper Notes outstanding at December 31, 2014. CSC’s ratings for these short-term borrowings are P1 by Moody’s, A1 by Standard & Poor’s, and F1 by Fitch. - 32 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) CSC maintains an $800 million committed, unsecured credit facility with a group of 12 banks, which is scheduled to expire in June 2015. This facility replaced a similar facility that expired in June 2014 and both facilities were unused during 2014. The funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes. The financial covenants under this facility require Schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, as defined, Schwab Bank to be well capitalized, as defined, and CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2014, the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was $7.8 billion (CSC’s stockholders’ equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, at December 31, 2014, was $11.6 billion). Management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on CSC’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements. CSC also has direct access to certain of the uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines discussed below, that are primarily utilized by Schwab to manage short-term liquidity. These lines were not used by CSC during 2014. In addition, Schwab provided CSC with a $1.0 billion credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in December 2014. Schwab terminated this credit facility in July 2014. Schwab Schwab’s liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts, which were $32.0 billion and $33.2 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for Schwab. Schwab is subject to regulatory requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Uniform Net Capital Rule) that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit Schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings from CSC, paying cash dividends, or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000. At December 31, 2014, Schwab’s net capital was $1.6 billion (10% of aggregate debit balances), which was $1.2 billion in excess of its minimum required net capital and $739 million in excess of 5% of aggregate debit balances. Schwab is also subject to Rule 15c3-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and other applicable regulations that require it to maintain cash or qualified securities in a segregated reserve account for the exclusive benefit of clients. These funds are included in cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and are not available as a general source of liquidity. Most of Schwab’s assets are readily convertible to cash, consisting primarily of short-term investment-grade, interest-earning investments (the majority of which are segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients pursuant to regulatory requirements), receivables from brokerage clients, and receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations. Client margin loans are demand loan obligations secured by readily marketable securities. Receivables from and payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations primarily represent current open transactions, which usually settle, or can be closed out, within a few business days. Schwab has a finance lease obligation related to an office building and land under a 20-year lease. The remaining finance lease obligation of $83 million at December 31, 2014, is being reduced by a portion of the lease payments over the remaining lease term of ten years. To manage short-term liquidity, Schwab maintains uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines with a group of banks. The need for short-term borrowings arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest-earnings investments, and movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements. Schwab used such borrowings for three days in 2014, with average daily amounts borrowed of $25 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2014. - 33 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) To partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation, Schwab has unsecured standby letter of credit agreements (LOCs) with five banks in favor of the Options Clearing Corporation aggregating $225 million at December 31, 2014. There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs during 2014. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. Schwab satisfies the collateral requirements by providing cash as collateral. To manage Schwab’s regulatory capital requirement, CSC provides Schwab with a $1.4 billion subordinated revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in March 2016. The amount outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2014, was $315 million. Borrowings under this subordinated lending arrangement qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab. In addition, CSC provides Schwab with a $2.5 billion credit facility. In December 2014, CSC and Schwab agreed to extend the expiration date of this facility from December 2014 to December 2017. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab. There were no funds drawn under this facility at December 31, 2014. Schwab Bank Schwab Bank’s liquidity needs are met through deposits from banking clients and equity capital. Deposits from banking clients at December 31, 2014 were $102.8 billion, which includes the excess cash held in certain Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. brokerage accounts that is swept into deposit accounts at Schwab Bank. At December 31, 2014, these balances totaled $82.1 billion. Schwab Bank is subject to regulatory requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions, such as extensions of credit and repayment of loans between Schwab Bank and CSC or CSC’s other subsidiaries. In addition, Schwab Bank is required to provide notice to and may be required to obtain approval of the OCC and the Federal Reserve to declare dividends to CSC. Schwab Bank is required to maintain capital levels as specified in federal banking laws and regulations. Failure to meet the minimum levels could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on Schwab Bank. The Company currently utilizes a target Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for Schwab Bank of at least 6.25%. Beginning on January 1, 2015, Schwab Bank is subject to new capital requirements set by the OCC. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2014, Schwab Bank is considered well capitalized. Schwab Bank’s regulatory capital and ratios are as follows: Minimum to be Minimum Capital Actual Well Capitalized Requirement December 31, 2014 Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital $ 7,700 22.1 % $ 2,095 6.0 % $ 1,397 4.0 % Total Risk-Based Capital $ 7,744 22.2 % $ 3,492 10.0 % $ 2,793 8.0 % Tier 1 Leverage $ 7,700 6.9 % $ 5,548 5.0 % $ 4,438 4.0 % Tangible Equity $ 7,700 6.9 % N/A $ 2,219 2.0 % N/A Not applicable. Schwab Bank has access to traditional funding sources such as deposits, federal funds purchased, and repurchase agreements. Additionally, Schwab Bank has access to short-term funding through the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) discount window. Amounts available under the FRB discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain of Schwab Bank’s securities available for sale and/or securities held to maturity that are pledged as collateral to the FRB. Schwab Bank maintains policies and procedures necessary to access this funding and tests discount window borrowing procedures annually. At December 31, 2014, $2.3 billion was available under this arrangement. There were no funds drawn under this arrangement during 2014. Schwab Bank maintains a credit facility with the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Amounts available under this facility are dependent on the amount of Schwab Bank’s residential real estate mortgages and HELOCs that are pledged as collateral. - 34 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Schwab Bank maintains policies and procedures necessary to access this funding and tests borrowing procedures annually. At December 31, 2014, $9.0 billion was available under this facility. There were no funds drawn under this facility during 2014. optionsXpress, Inc. optionsXpress, Inc.’s liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts, which were $942 million at December 31, 2014. Management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for optionsXpress, Inc. optionsXpress, Inc., is subject to regulatory requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit optionsXpress, Inc. from paying cash dividends or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000. At December 31, 2014, optionsXpress Inc.’s net capital was $123 million (38% of aggregate debit balances), which was $117 million in excess of its minimum required net capital and $107 million in excess of 5% of aggregate debit balances. optionsXpress, Inc. is also subject to Commodity Futures Trading Commission Regulation 1.17 (Reg. 1.17) under the Commodity Exchange Act, which also requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. optionsXpress, Inc. as a futures commission merchant, is required to maintain minimum net capital equal to the greater of its net capital requirement under Reg. 1.17 ($1 million), or the sum of 8% of the total risk margin requirements for all positions carried in customer accounts and 8% of the total risk margin requirements for all positions carried in non-customer accounts (as defined in Reg. 1.17). At December 31, 2014, optionsXpress, Inc. met the requirements of Reg. 1.17. Additionally, optionsXpress, Inc. is subject to Rule 15c3-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and other applicable regulations that require it to maintain cash or qualified securities in a segregated reserve account for the exclusive benefit of clients. These funds are included in cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and are not available as a general source of liquidity. To partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation, optionsXpress, Inc. has an unsecured standby LOC with one bank in favor of the Options Clearing Corporation in the amount of $15 million at December 31, 2014. There were no funds drawn under this LOC during 2014. CSC provides optionsXpress, Inc. with a $200 million credit facility. In December 2014, CSC and optionsXpress, Inc. agreed to extend the expiration date of this facility from December 2014 to December 2016. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for optionsXpress, Inc. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2014. optionsXpress has a term loan with CSC, of which $12 million was outstanding at December 31, 2014, and it matures in December 2017. Capital Resources The Company’s cash position (reported as cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated balance sheets) and cash flows are affected by changes in brokerage client cash balances and the associated amounts required to be segregated under regulatory guidelines. Timing differences between cash and investments actually segregated on a given date and the amount required to be segregated for that date may arise in the ordinary course of business, and are addressed by the Company in accordance with applicable regulations. Other factors which affect the Company’s cash position and cash flows include investment activity in security portfolios, levels of capital expenditures, acquisition and divestiture activity, banking client deposit activity, brokerage and banking client loan activity, financing activity in long-term debt, payments of dividends, and repurchases and issuances of CSC’s preferred and common stock. The combination of these factors can cause significant fluctuations in the cash position during specific time periods. - 35 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The Company monitors both the relative composition and absolute level of its capital structure. Management is focused on optimizing the Company’s use of capital and currently targets a long-term debt to total financial capital ratio not to exceed 30%. The Company’s total financial capital (long-term debt plus stockholders’ equity) at December 31, 2014 was $13.7 billion, up $1.4 billion, or 12%, from December 31, 2013. Long-term Debt At December 31, 2014, the Company had long-term debt of $1.9 billion, or 14% of total financial capital, that bears interest at a weighted-average rate of 3.60%. At December 31, 2013, the Company had long-term debt of $1.9 billion, or 15% of total financial capital. On July 25, 2013, CSC issued $275 million of Senior Notes that mature in 2018 under its Shelf Registration Statement. The Senior Notes have a fixed interest rate of 2.20% with interest payable semi-annually. The Company repaid $6 million of other long-term debt in 2014. For further discussion of the Company’s long-term debt, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Liquidity” and “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 13. Borrowings.” Capital Expenditures The Company’s capital expenditures were $405 million (7% of net revenues) and $270 million (5% of net revenues) in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2014 were primarily for buildings and land relating to changes in the Company’s geographic footprint, developing internal-use software, and software and equipment relating to the Company’s information technology systems. Capital expenditures in 2013 were primarily for buildings and land, capitalized costs for developing internal-use software, and software and equipment relating to the Company’s information technology systems. Capitalized costs for developing internal-use software were $81 million and $74 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Management currently anticipates that 2015 capital expenditures will be approximately 15% lower than 2014 primarily due to decreased spending on buildings and furniture and equipment. A majority of this decrease is due to the construction of the Company’s new office campus in Denver, Colorado in 2014. As in recent years, the Company adjusts its capital expenditures periodically as business conditions change. Management believes that funds generated by its operations will continue to be the primary funding source of its capital expenditures. Dividends CSC paid common stock cash dividends of $316 million ($0.24 per share) and $311 million ($0.24 per share) in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Since the initial dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 103 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend rate 19 times, resulting in a 21% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, the Company currently targets its common stock cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income. CSC paid Series A Preferred Stock cash dividends of $28 million ($70.00 per share) in 2014 and 2013, respectively. CSC paid Series B Preferred Stock cash dividends of $29 million ($60.00 per share) in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Share Repurchases There were no repurchases of CSC’s common stock in 2014 or 2013. As of December 31, 2014, CSC had remaining authority from the Board of Directors to repurchase up to $596 million of its common stock, which is not subject to expiration. Business Acquisition On December 14, 2012, the Company acquired ThomasPartners, Inc., a growth and dividend income-focused asset management firm, for $85 million in cash. - 36 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) For more information on this acquisition, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 24. Business Acquisition.” Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of its clients. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, the Company enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For information on each of these arrangements, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 14. Commitments and Contingencies and 15. Financial Instruments Subject to Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk or Concentration Risk.” Contractual Obligations The Company’s principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014, are shown in the following table. Management believes that funds generated by its continuing operations, as well as cash provided by external financing, will continue to be the primary funding sources in meeting these obligations. Excluded from this table are liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet that are generally short-term in nature (e.g., payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations) or without contractual payment terms (e.g., deposits from banking clients, payables to brokerage clients, and deferred compensation).

(3) Represents minimum rental commitments, net of sublease commitments, and includes facilities under the Company’s past restructuring initiatives and rental commitments under a finance lease obligation. (4) Consists of purchase obligations for services such as advertising and marketing, telecommunications, professional services, and hardware- and software-related agreements. Includes purchase obligations that can be canceled by the Company without penalty. Risk MANAGEMENT The Company’s business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, credit, market, liquidity, compliance and legal risk. The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. Despite the Company’s efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks. The Company’s risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting and risk mitigation. The activities and organizations that comprise the risk management process are described below. Risk Culture The Company’s Board of Directors sets the tone for effective risk management and has approved an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework commensurate with the size, risk profile, complexity, and continuing growth of the - 37 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Company. The ERM Framework and governance structure constitute a comprehensive approach to managing risks encountered by the Company in its business activities. Risk appetite, which is defined as the amount of risk the Company is willing to accept in pursuit of its corporate strategy, is set by executive management and approved by the Board of Directors. The Company has established risk metrics and reporting that enable the measurement of the impact of strategy execution against risk appetite. The risk metrics, with risk limits and tolerance levels, are established for key risk categories by the Global Risk Committee and its functional risk sub-committees. Risk Governance Senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring and controlling risks. The Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior executives from each major business and control function, is responsible for the oversight of risk management. This includes identifying emerging risks, assessing risk management practices and the control environment, reinforcing business accountability for risk management, supervisory controls and regulatory compliance, supporting resource prioritization across the Company, and escalating significant issues to the Board of Directors. The Global Risk Committee reports regularly to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. The Risk Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the Company’s risk management program, including approving risk appetite statements and reviewing reports relating to risk issues from functional areas of risk management, legal, compliance, and internal audit. Functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report into the Global Risk Committee. These sub-committees include the: · Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee, which establishes strategies and policies for the management of corporate capital, liquidity, interest rate risk, and investments; · Credit and Market Risk Oversight Committee, which provides oversight of and approves credit and market risk policies, limits, and exposures in loan, investment, and positioning portfolios; · New Products and Services Risk Oversight Committee, which provides oversight of, and approves corporate policy and procedures relating to the risk governance of new products and services; and the · Operational Risk Oversight Committee, which provides oversight of and approves operational risk management policies, risk tolerance levels, and operational risk governance processes, and includes the following sub-committees: o Client Fiduciary Risk Sub-Committee, which provides oversight of fiduciary risk throughout the Company; o Information Security and Privacy Sub-Committee, which provides oversight of the information security and privacy programs and policies; o Model Governance Sub-Committee, which provides oversight of model risk throughout the Company; and the o Vendor Management Sub-Committee, which provides oversight of the Company’s vendor management and outsourcing program and policies. Senior management has also created an Incentive Compensation Risk Oversight Committee, which establishes policy and provides oversight of incentive compensation risk. The committee reviews and approves the Annual Risk Assessment of incentive compensation plans, and reports directly to the Board Compensation Committee. The Company’s compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and corporate risk management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring the Company’s risk management. In addition, the Company’s Disclosure Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s (a) disclosure controls and procedures and (b) internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal - 38 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Operational Risk Operational risks arise due to potentially inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events and relationships impacting the Company and/or any of its key business partners and vendors. Operational risk includes model and fiduciary risk, and each is also described in detail below. The Company’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and the Company’s success depends, in part, on its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its technology in anticipation of evolving client needs. To the extent the Company experiences system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to its systems, linkages with third-party systems, and power failures), the Company’s business and operations could be significantly negatively impacted. To minimize business interruptions, Schwab has two data centers intended, in part, to further improve the recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency. The Company is committed to an ongoing process of upgrading, enhancing, and testing its technology systems. This effort is focused on meeting client needs, meeting market and regulatory changes, and deploying standardized technology platforms. Operational risk also includes the risk of human error, employee misconduct, external fraud, computer viruses, cyber attacks, terrorist attacks, and natural disaster. Employee misconduct could include fraud and misappropriation of client or Company assets, improper use or disclosure of confidential client or Company information, and unauthorized activities, such as transactions exceeding acceptable risks or authorized limits. External fraud includes misappropriation of client or Company assets by third parties, including through unauthorized access to Company systems and data and client accounts. The frequency and sophistication of such fraud attempts continue to increase. Operational risk is mitigated through a system of internal controls and risk management practices that are designed to keep operational risk and operational losses at levels appropriate to the inherent risk of the business in which the Company operates. The Company has specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and uses periodic risk self-assessments and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The Company maintains backup and recovery functions, including facilities for backup and communications, and conducts periodic testing of disaster recovery plans. The Company also maintains policies and procedures and technology to protect against fraud and unauthorized access to systems and data. Despite the Company’s risk management efforts, it is not always possible to deter or prevent technological or operational failure, or fraud or other misconduct, and the precautions taken by the Company may not be effective in all cases. The Company may be subject to litigation, losses, and regulatory actions in such cases, and may be required to expend significant additional resources to remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures. The Company also faces operational risk when it employs the services of various external vendors, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. The Company manages its exposure to external vendor risk through contractual provisions, control standards, and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance. The Company maintains policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with Company data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-public client information. The Company clearly defines for employees, contractors, and vendors the Company’s expected standards of care for confidential data. Regular training is provided by the Company in regard to data security. The Company is actively engaged in the research and development of new technologies, services, and products. The Company endeavors to protect its research and development efforts, and its brands, through the use of copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and contracts. - 39 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Model Risk Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. Models are owned by several business units throughout the Company, and are used for a variety of purposes. Model use includes, but is not limited to, calculating capital requirements for hypothetical stressful environments, estimating interest and credit risk for loans and other balance sheet assets, and providing guidance in the management of client portfolios. The Company has established a policy to describe the roles and responsibilities of all key stakeholders in model development, management, and use. All models at the Company are registered in a centralized database and classified into different risk ratings depending on their potential financial, reputational, or regulatory impact to the Company. The model risk rating informs the scope of all model governance activities. Fiduciary Risk Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. The Company attempts to manage this risk by establishing procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees. Credit Risk Credit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations. The Company’s direct exposure to credit risk mainly results from margin lending and client option and futures activities, securities lending activities, mortgage lending activities, its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and other investing activities. To manage the risks of such losses, the Company has established policies and procedures which include: establishing and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin, option, and futures requirements for certain securities. Collateral arrangements relating to margin loans, option positions, securities lending agreements, and resale agreements include provisions that require additional collateral in the event that market fluctuations result in declines in the value of collateral received. Additionally, for margin loan and securities lending agreements, collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral exceeds the amounts loaned. The Company’s credit risk exposure related to loans to banking clients is actively managed through individual and portfolio reviews performed by management. Management regularly reviews asset quality, including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for loan losses. The Company’s mortgage loan portfolios primarily include First Mortgages of $8.1 billion and HELOCs of $3.0 billion at December 31, 2014. The Company’s underwriting guidelines include maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan is conforming or jumbo). These credit underwriting standards have limited the exposure to the types of loans that experienced high foreclosures and loss rates elsewhere in the industry in recent years. In January 2014, the Company revised its First Mortgage underwriting criteria in conformance with the CFPB’s new guidance on Qualified Mortgage lending and a borrower’s ability to repay. Revisions were made to requirements affecting debt to income ratio, loan to value ratio, and liquid asset holdings. These revised underwriting criteria are not expected to have a material impact on the credit quality of the Company’s First Mortgage or HELOC portfolios. The Company does not purchase loans that allow for negative amortization and does not purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. At December 31, 2014, approximately 1% of both the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios consisted of loans to borrowers with updated FICO scores of less than 620. - 40 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) At December 31, 2014, the weighted-average originated LTV ratio was 59% for both the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios. The computation of the origination LTV ratio for a HELOC includes any first lien mortgage outstanding on the same property at the time of origination. At December 31, 2014, 21% of HELOCs ($635 million of the HELOC portfolio) were in a first lien position. The weighted-average originated FICO score was 770 and 769 for the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, respectively. The Company monitors the estimated current LTV ratios of its First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios on an ongoing basis. At December 31, 2014, the weighted-average estimated current LTV ratios were 50% and 55% for the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, respectively. The computation of the estimated current LTV ratio for a HELOC includes any first lien mortgage outstanding on the same property at the time of the HELOC’s origination. The Company estimates the current LTV ratio for each loan by reference to a home price appreciation index. The Company also monitors updated borrower FICO scores, delinquency trends, and verified liquid assets held by individual borrowers. At December 31, 2014, the weighted-average updated FICO scores were 773 and 769 for the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, respectively. A portion of the Company’s HELOC portfolio is secured by second liens on the associated properties. Second lien mortgage loans possess a higher degree of credit risk given the subordination to the first lien holder in the event of default. At December 31, 2014, $2.3 billion, or 79%, of the HELOC portfolio was in a second lien position. In addition to the credit monitoring activities described above, the Company also monitors credit risk on second lien HELOC loans by reviewing the delinquency status of the first lien loan on the associated property. Additionally, at December 31, 2014, approximately 30% of the HELOC borrowers that had a balance only paid the minimum amount due. For more information on the Company’s credit quality indicators relating to its First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, including delinquency characteristics, borrower FICO scores at origination, updated borrower FICO scores, LTV ratios at origination, and estimated current LTV ratios, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 6. Loans to Banking Clients and Related Allowance for Loan Losses.” The following table presents certain of the Company’s loan quality metrics as a percentage of total outstanding loans: December 31, 2014 2013 Loan delinquencies (1) 0.27 % 0.48 % Nonaccrual loans 0.26 % 0.39 % Allowance for loan losses 0.31 % 0.39 % (1) Loan delinquencies include loans that are 30 days or more past due and other nonaccrual loans. The Company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale and securities held to maturity portfolios, whose fair values totaled $54.8 billion and $34.7 billion at December 31, 2014, respectively. These portfolios include U.S. agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, certificates of deposit, and treasury securities. U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. At December 31, 2014, with the exception of certain non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, all securities in the available for sale and held to maturity portfolios were rated investment grade (defined as a rating equivalent to a Moody’s rating of “Baa” or higher, or a Standard & Poor’s rating of “BBB-” or higher). In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company sold $504 million of its non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, resulting in a net realized loss of $8 million. The Company marked the remaining $15 million of these securities to market and recorded a $0.6 million other-than-temporary impairment charge in the fourth quarter. The decision was made to sell the securities in the fourth quarter as market valuations on these non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities became more consistent with actual performance. In addition, the Company has reached an initial settlement in legal claims it is pursuing to recover losses relating to certain of these securities. - 41 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Schwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab’s client or a counterparty fails to meet its obligations to Schwab. Concentration Risk The Company has exposure to concentration risk when holding large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or within a particular industry. The fair value of the Company’s investments in mortgage-backed securities totaled $53.8 billion at December 31, 2014. Of these, $52.5 billion were issued by U.S. agencies and $1.3 billion were issued by private entities (non-agency securities). These U.S. agency and non-agency securities are included in securities available for sale and securities held to maturity. The fair value of the Company’s investments in asset-backed securities totaled $19.4 billion at December 31, 2014. Of these, $11.7 billion were securities backed by student loans, the majority of which are guaranteed by the U.S. federal government. These asset-backed securities are included in securities available for sale. The fair value of the Company’s investments in corporate debt securities and commercial paper totaled $8.1 billion at December 31, 2014, with the majority issued by institutions in the financial services industry. These securities are included in securities available for sale, cash and cash equivalents, and other securities owned in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Issuer, geographic, and sector concentrations are controlled by established credit policy limits to each concentration type. The Company’s loans to banking clients include $7.4 billion of adjustable rate First Mortgage loans at December 31, 2014. The Company’s adjustable rate mortgages have initial fixed interest rates for three to ten years and interest rates that adjust annually thereafter. Approximately 40% of these mortgages consisted of loans with interest-only payment terms. The interest rates on approximately 65% of these interest-only loans are not scheduled to reset for three or more years. The Company’s mortgage loans do not include interest terms described as temporary introductory rates below current market rates. The Company’s HELOC product has a 30-year loan term with an initial draw period of ten years from the date of origination. After the initial draw period, the balance outstanding at such time is converted to a 20-year amortizing loan. The interest rate during the initial draw period and the 20-year amortizing period is a floating rate based on the prime rate plus a margin. HELOCs that convert to an amortizing loan may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates than those in the initial draw period. The Company’s allowance for loan loss methodology takes this increased inherent risk into consideration. The following table presents when current outstanding HELOCs will convert to amortizing loans: December 31, 2014 Balance Converted to amortizing loan by period end $ 307 Within 1 year 274 > 1 year – 3 years 356 > 3 years – 5 years 1,139 > 5 years 879 Total $ 2,955 The Company also has exposure to concentration risk from its margin and securities lending and client option and futures activities collateralized by or referencing securities of a single issuer, an index, or within a single industry. This concentration risk is mitigated by collateral arrangements that require the fair value of such collateral exceeds the amounts loaned. The Company has indirect exposure to U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral to secure its resale agreements. The Company’s primary credit exposure on these resale transactions is with its counterparty. The Company would have exposure to the U.S. Government and agency securities only in the event of the counterparty’s default on the resale agreements. The fair value of U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral for resale agreements totaled $10.4 billion at December 31, 2014. - 42 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) European Holdings The Company has exposure to non-sovereign financial and non-financial institutions in Europe. The following table shows the balances of this exposure by each country in Europe in which the issuer or counterparty is domiciled. The Company has no direct exposure to sovereign governments in Europe. The Company does not have unfunded commitments to counterparties in Europe, nor does it have exposure as a result of credit default protection purchased or sold separately as of December 31, 2014. The determination of the domicile of exposure varies by the type of investment. For time deposits and certificates of deposit, the exposure is grouped in the country in which the financial institution is chartered under the regulatory framework of the European country. For asset-backed commercial paper, the exposure is grouped by the country of the sponsoring bank that provides the credit and liquidity support for such instruments. For corporate debt securities, the exposure is grouped by the country in which the issuer is domiciled. In situations in which the Company invests in a corporate debt security of a U.S. subsidiary of a European parent company, such holdings will be attributable to the European country only if significant reliance is placed on the European parent company for credit support underlying the security. For substantially all of the holdings listed below, the issuers or counterparties were financial institutions. All of the Company’s resale agreements, which are included in investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes, are collateralized by U.S. government securities. Additionally, the Company’s securities lending activities are collateralized by cash. Therefore, the Company’s resale agreements and securities lending activities are not included in the table below even if the counterparty is a European institution.

At December 31, 2014, the Company had $224 million in investments in these Funds. Certain of the Funds’ positions include certificates of deposits, time deposits, commercial paper and corporate debt securities issued by counterparties in Europe. Management mitigates exposure to European holdings by employing a separate team of credit analysts that evaluate each issuer, counterparty, and country. Management monitors its exposure to European issuers by 1) performing risk assessments of the foreign countries, which include evaluating the size of the country and economy, currency trends, political landscape and the countries’ regulatory environment and developments; 2) performing ad hoc stress tests that evaluate the impact of sovereign governments’ debt write-downs on financial issuers and counterparties the Company has exposure to through its investments; 3) reviewing publicly available stress tests that are published by various regulators in the European market; 4) establishing credit and maturity limits by issuer; and 5) establishing and monitoring aggregate credit limits by geography and sector. Market Risk Market risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by the Company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices or market conditions. Included in market risk is interest rate risk, which is the risk - 43 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) to earnings or capital arising from movement of interest rates. For discussion of the Company’s market risk, see “Item 7A – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk arises from the inability to meet obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses. It is the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument. Limits and contingency funding scenarios have been established for the Company to support liquidity levels and quality during both expected and stressed scenarios. The Company seeks to maintain client confidence in its balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the firm to meet its obligations under both expected and stressed scenarios. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional detail on the Company’s liquidity requirements. Compliance Risk The Company faces significant compliance risk in its business, that is, the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, fines or penalties, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, or other regulatory requirements. Among other things, compliance risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for Company products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of the Company’s controls. The Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, including SROs. Such regulation is becoming increasingly extensive and complex, and regulatory proceedings and sanctions against financial services firms continue to increase. The Company attempts to manage compliance risk through policies, procedures and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, client privacy, and employment policies. Despite the Company’s efforts to maintain an effective compliance program and internal controls, legal breaches and rule violations could result in reputational harm, significant losses and disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on the Company’s business activities. Legal Risk Legal risk is a consequence of operational failure – the risk of a claim for damages brought by clients, employees or other third parties, alleging error that amounts to a breach of legal requirements or other duties under law. The financial services industry is subject to substantial litigation risk, and the firm incurs legal claims in the ordinary course of business. Increased litigation costs or substantial legal liability relating to an extraordinary claim or incidence of claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial condition. For information about the Company’s legal risk, see “Item 1A – Risk Factors,” and “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 14. Commitments and Contingencies.” Capital Planning The capital plan considers significant risks to meeting the Company’s capital goals over time and through evolving economic, financial, and business environments. Internal guidelines are set, for both the Company and regulated subsidiaries, to ensure continued regulatory compliance as well as to meet expectations of investors and rating agencies. The capital plan also considers the potential effects of a sudden and sustained systemic economic downturn, idiosyncratic events which are uniquely impactful to the Company, and sensitivity analyses applied to significant assumptions that are either quantitative or qualitative in nature. The comprehensive Capital Contingency Plan was developed by the Company to address the action plans for certain capital events with low probability, but high severity, that the Company might face. The Capital Contingency Plan is issued under the authority of the Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee and provides guidelines for sustained capital events. It does not specifically address every contingency, but is designed to provide a framework for responding to any capital stress. - 44 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Capital forecasts are reviewed monthly at Capital Planning and Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee meetings and semi-annually at the Company’s Board of Directors meetings. Exceptions to internal guidelines are also reviewed at quarterly Global Risk Committee meetings. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company uses the market and income approaches to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, and to determine fair value disclosures. See “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and 16. Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities” for more information on the Company’s assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. When available, the Company uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. When utilizing market data with a bid-ask spread, the Company uses the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices do not exist, the Company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets. The Company generally obtains prices from at least three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value and may obtain up to five prices on assets with higher risk of limited observable information, such as non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. The Company’s primary independent pricing service provides prices based on observable trades and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar “to-be-issued” securities. The Company compares the prices obtained from its primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. The Company does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in a material difference in the recorded amounts. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company did not adjust prices received from the primary independent third-party pricing service. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. While the majority of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position and reported financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy. Other-than-Temporary Impairment of Securities Available for Sale and Securities Held to Maturity Management evaluates whether securities available for sale and securities held to maturity are other-than-temporarily impaired (OTTI) on a quarterly basis. Debt securities with unrealized losses are considered OTTI if the Company intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such security before any anticipated recovery. If management determines that a security is OTTI under these circumstances, the impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the entire difference between the amortized cost and the then-current fair value. A security is also OTTI if management does not expect to recover the amortized cost of the security. In this circumstance, the impairment recognized in earnings represents estimated credit loss, and is measured by the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost of the security. Management utilizes cash flow models to estimate the expected future cash flow from the securities and to estimate the credit loss. Expected cash flows are discounted using the security’s effective interest rate. - 45 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The evaluation of whether the Company expects to recover the amortized cost of a security is inherently judgmental. The evaluation includes the assessment of several bond performance indicators including: the portion of the underlying loans that are delinquent (30 days, 60 days, 90+ days), in bankruptcy, in foreclosure or converted to real estate owned; the actual amount of loss incurred on the underlying loans in which the property has been foreclosed and sold; the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security available to absorb credit losses on the underlying loans; the current price and magnitude of the unrealized loss; and whether the Company has received all scheduled principal and interest payments. Management uses cash flow models to further assess the likelihood of other-than-temporary impairment for the Company’s non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. To develop the cash flow models, the Company uses forecasted loss severity, prepayment speeds (i.e. the rate at which the principal on underlying loans are paid down), and default rates over the securities’ expected remaining maturities. Valuation of Goodwill The Company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually, or whenever indications of impairment exist. Impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, resulting in an impairment charge for this excess. Adverse changes in the Company’s planned business operations such as unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit, or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the Company’s recorded goodwill. The Company’s annual goodwill impairment testing date is April 1st. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on April 1, 2014, management performed an assessment of each of the Company’s reporting units (generally defined as the Company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) and concluded that goodwill was not impaired. Allowance for Loan Losses The appropriateness of the allowance is reviewed quarterly by management, taking into consideration current economic conditions, the existing loan portfolio composition, past loss experience, and risks inherent in the portfolio. The methodology to establish an allowance for loan losses related to the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolio utilizes statistical models that estimate prepayments, defaults, and probable losses for the loan segments based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the segments. The methodology considers the effects of borrower behavior and a variety of factors including, but not limited to, interest rates, housing price movements as measured by a housing price index, economic conditions, estimated defaults and foreclosures measured by historical and expected delinquencies, changes in prepayment speeds, LTV ratios, past loss experience, estimates of future loss severities, borrower credit risk measured by FICO scores, and the adequacy of collateral. The methodology also evaluates concentrations in the loan segments including loan products, year of origination, and geographical distribution of collateral. Probable losses are forecast using a loan-level simulation of the delinquency status of the loans over the term of the loans. The simulation starts with the current relevant risk indicators, including the current delinquent status of each loan, the estimated current LTV ratio of each loan, the term and structure of each loan, current key interest rates including U.S. Treasury and London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rates, and borrower FICO scores. The more significant variables in the simulation include delinquency roll rates, loss severity, housing prices, and interest rates. Delinquency roll rates (i.e., the rates at which loans transition through delinquency stages and ultimately result in a loss) are estimated from the Company’s historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information. Further, the delinquency roll rates within the loan-level simulation discussed above are calibrated to match a moving average of the delinquency roll rates actually experienced in the respective First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios. Loss severity estimates are based on the Company’s historical loss experience and market trends. The estimated loss severity (i.e. loss given default) used in the allowance for loan loss methodology for HELOCs is higher than that used in the methodology for First Mortgages. Housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values. Factors affecting the home price index include: housing inventory, unemployment, interest rates, and inflation expectations. Interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths. As a result, the current state of house prices and the current state of delinquencies unique to the Company’s First Mortgage and - 46 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) HELOC portfolios are considered in the allowance for loan loss methodology. This methodology results in loss factors that are applied to the outstanding balances to determine the allowance for loan loss for each loan segment. The allowance for personal loans secured by securities is established on a loan by loan basis. The market value of collateral pledged by borrowers is regularly reviewed to ensure the Company’s commitment to extend credit is over-collateralized. If collateral is in danger of falling below specified levels, the Company may reduce a borrower’s committed line or may liquidate collateral. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the allowance for loan losses related to personal loans secured by securities was immaterial. Legal and Regulatory Reserves Reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, insurance coverage and indemnification, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved. The Company’s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee. Additionally, management has reviewed with the Audit Committee the Company’s significant estimates discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. - 47 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by the Company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices or market conditions. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on its interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources that finance these assets. The majority of the Company’s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. To a lesser degree, the Company is sensitive to changes in long-term interest rates through some of its investment portfolios. To manage the Company’s market risk related to interest rates, management utilizes simulation models, which include the net interest revenue sensitivity analysis described below. Net interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may reprice at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short and long-term interest rates. Interest-earning assets include residential real estate loans and mortgage-backed securities. These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and to changes to prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment. Because the Company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients and the rates charged on margin loans and loans to banking clients, and controls the composition of its investment securities, it has some ability to manage its net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions. To mitigate the risk of loss, the Company has established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk, and monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interest-earning assets and funding sources. To remain within these guidelines, the Company manages the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios. The Company is also subject to market risk as a result of fluctuations in option and equity prices. The Company’s direct holdings of option and equity securities and its associated exposure to option and equity prices are not material. The Company is indirectly exposed to option, futures, and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option and futures accounts, securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers, and customer securities loaned out as part of the Company’s securities lending activities. Equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity, margin borrowing, and overall client engagement with the Company. Additionally, the Company earns mutual fund service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets. Fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue earned by the Company. Financial instruments held by the Company are also subject to liquidity risk – that is, the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument. Current conditions in the credit markets have significantly reduced market liquidity in a wide range of financial instruments, including the types of instruments held by the Company, and fair value can differ significantly from the value implied by the credit quality and actual performance of the instrument’s underlying cash flows. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue, see “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Current Market and Regulatory Environment and Other Developments.” The Company’s market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material. Net Interest Revenue Simulation For the Company’s net interest revenue sensitivity analysis, the Company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulation includes all interest-sensitive assets and liabilities. Key variables in the simulation include the repricing of financial instruments, prepayment, reinvestment, and - 48 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION product pricing assumptions. The Company uses constant balances and market rates in the simulation assumptions in order to minimize the number of variables and to better isolate risks. The simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies, including changes in asset and liability mix. If the Company’s guidelines for its net interest revenue sensitivity are breached, management must report the breach to the Company’s Corporate Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee (Corporate ALCO) and establish a plan to address the interest rate risk. This plan could include, but is not limited to, rebalancing certain investment portfolios or using derivative instruments to mitigate the interest rate risk. Depending on the severity and expected duration of the breach, as well as the then current interest rate environment, the plan could also be to take no action. Any plan that recommends taking action is required to be approved by the Company’s Corporate ALCO. There were no breaches of the Company’s net interest revenue sensitivity guidelines during the years ended December 31, 2014 or 2013. As represented by the simulations presented below, the Company’s investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall. The simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As the Company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood the Company would take steps to manage any additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment. The following table shows the results of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to the Company’s current market rates forecast on simulated net interest revenue over the next 12 months beginning December 31, 2014 and 2013. December 31, 2014 2013 Increase of 100 basis points 11.8 % 11.0 % Decrease of 100 basis points (4.9) % (4.5) % The sensitivities shown in the simulation reflect the fact that short-term interest rates in 2014 remained at historically low levels, including the federal funds target rate, which was unchanged at a range of zero to 0.25%. The current low interest rate environment limits the extent to which the Company can reduce interest expense paid on funding sources. A decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the Company’s investment portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense, further compressing net interest margin. Any increases in short-term interest rates result in a greater impact as yields on interest-earning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources. - 49 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION",2023-12-30 18:56:38.935917

316709,SCHW,SCHWAB CHARLES CORP,2017,"Item 7. ﻿ Developments in the business, economic, and geopolitical environment could negatively impact the Company’s business. ﻿ The Company’s business can be adversely affected by the general environment – economic, corporate, securities market, regulatory, and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations, trading activity, interest rates and overall investor engagement, and are outside of the Company’s control. Deterioration in the housing and credit markets, reductions - 9 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION in short-term interest rates, and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact the Company’s results of operations and capital resources. ﻿ Extensive regulation of the Company’s businesses may subject it to significant penalties or limitations on business activities. ﻿ As a participant in the securities, banking and financial services industries, the Company is subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws by governmental agencies, supervisory authorities and SROs. Such regulation continues to grow more extensive and complex, the costs and uncertainty related to complying with such regulations continue to increase, and regulatory proceedings continue to become more frequent and sanctions more severe. The requirements imposed by the Company’s regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets, the safety and soundness of financial institutions and the protection of clients. These regulations affect the Company’s business operations and impose capital, client protection and market conduct requirements. ﻿ In addition to specific banking laws and regulations, the Company’s banking regulators have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies and could require CSC and/or Schwab Bank to hold more capital, increase liquidity or limit their ability to pay dividends or CSC’s ability to repurchase shares. The banking regulators could also limit the Company’s ability to grow, including adding assets, launching new products, making acquisitions and undertaking strategic investments, could limit Schwab Bank’s ability to accept deposits swept from client brokerage accounts and brokered deposits and could prevent the Company from pursuing its business strategy. ﻿ Despite the Company’s efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements, there are a number of risks, particularly in areas where applicable laws or regulations may be unclear or where regulators could revise their previous guidance. Any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by the Company’s regulators against the Company or its affiliates, officers or employees could result in fines, penalties, cease and desist orders, enforcement actions, suspension, disqualification or expulsion, or other disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on the Company’s business activities, any of which could harm the Company’s reputation and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. ﻿ While the Company maintains systems and procedures designed to ensure that it complies with applicable laws and regulations, violations could occur. In addition, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time. There may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance, including restrictions on certain activities. Such a finding may also damage the Company’s reputation and its relationships with its regulators and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in the Company’s securities. ﻿ Legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively affect the Company’s business and financial results. ﻿ New legislation, rules, regulations and guidance, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal, state, foreign and SRO rules, regulations and guidance, including changes relating to mutual funds, broker-dealer fiduciary duties and regulatory treatment of deposit accounts may directly affect the operation and profitability of the Company or its specific business lines. The profitability of the Company could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes to the laws governing taxation, electronic commerce, client privacy and security of client data. In addition, the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business the Company conducts, modifications to the Company’s business practices, more stringent capital and liquidity requirements, increased deposit insurance assessments or additional costs. These changes may also require the Company to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to its compliance, risk management, treasury and operations functions. ﻿ While U.S. banking regulators have finalized many regulations to implement various provisions of Dodd-Frank and other financial reforms such as Basel III, implementation of the legislation is ongoing and significant rule-making and interpretations remain to be completed. For example, rules relating to a minimum net stable funding ratio (NSFR), which will require financial institutions to have a stable funding structure over a one-year horizon, have been proposed but have not yet been finalized. In addition, the SEC was given discretion to adopt rules regarding standards of conduct for broker-dealers providing investment advice to retail clients but has not yet made any rule proposals. The Company has incurred and will - 10 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION continue to incur significant additional costs and expend a significant amount of time as it develops and integrates appropriate systems and procedures to comply with the rule-making, and then monitors, supports and refines those systems and procedures. ﻿ Failure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect the Company’s financial condition. ﻿ CSC, together with Schwab Bank and its broker-dealer subsidiaries, must meet certain capital and liquidity standards, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about the adequacy of the Company’s capital and the Company’s internal assessment of its capital needs. The Uniform Net Capital Rule limits Schwab’s ability to transfer capital to CSC and other affiliates. New regulatory capital, liquidity, and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how the Company utilizes its capital, including paying dividends and stock repurchases, and may require the Company to increase its capital and/or liquidity or to limit its growth. Failure by either CSC or Schwab Bank to meet its minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a negative impact on the Company. In addition, failure by CSC or Schwab Bank to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to satisfy its capital conservation buffer requirements (as phased in) would result in restrictions on the Company’s ability to make capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers. Any requirement that the Company increase its regulatory capital, replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as Tier 1 capital, or increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity, could require the Company to liquidate assets, deleverage or otherwise change its business and/or investment plans, which may adversely affect its financial results. Issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders. ﻿ With $223 billion in consolidated total assets at December 31, 2016, the Company is currently only subject to the “standardized approach” framework of the Basel III capital and liquidity requirements. When the Company’s consolidated total assets equal or exceed $250 billion, the Company will become subject to the “advanced approaches” framework, including being subject to a supplementary leverage ratio, the inclusion of AOCI in regulatory capital, the unmodified LCR, enhanced Basel III disclosures, and a more complex calculation of risk weighted assets that includes an assessment of the impact of operational risk. In addition, federal banking agencies have broad discretion and could require CSC or Schwab Bank to hold higher levels of capital or increase liquidity above the applicable regulatory requirements. ﻿ For a discussion of the Company’s Liquidity and Capital Management, see Risk Management and Capital Management in Part II, Item 7 and Item 8 – Note 22. ﻿ Significant interest rate changes could affect the Company’s profitability. ﻿ The direction and level of interest rates are important factors in earnings. A decline in interest rates may have a negative impact on the Company’s net interest revenue. A low interest rate environment may also have a negative impact on the Company’s asset management and administration fee revenues if the Company has to waive a portion of its management fees for certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds in order to continue providing a positive return to clients. ﻿ Overall, the Company is positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment. A rise in interest rates may cause the Company’s funding costs to increase if market conditions or the competitive environment forces the Company to raise its interest rates to avoid losing deposits. Higher funding costs without offsetting increases in yields on interest-earning assets can reduce the Company’s net interest revenue. ﻿ For additional information on the Company’s net interest revenue, see Results of Operations and Risk Management in Part II, Item 7. ﻿ Security breaches of the Company’s systems, or those of its clients or third parties, may subject the Company to significant liability and damage the Company’s reputation. ﻿ The Company’s business involves the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential information about the Company and its clients. Information security risks for financial institutions are increasing, in part because of the use of the internet and mobile technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, activists, hackers and other external parties, including foreign state actors. The Company’s systems and those of other financial institutions have been and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks, malicious code, computer viruses - 11 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events. Despite the Company’s efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, the Company may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, for example, employee misconduct. ﻿ Security breaches, including breaches of the Company’s security measures or those of the Company’s third-party service providers or clients, could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject the Company to significant liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance, actions by the Company’s regulators, damage to the Company’s reputation, or a loss of confidence in the Company’s security measures which could harm the Company’s business. The Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures. ﻿ The Company also faces risk related to external fraud involving the compromise of clients’ personal electronic devices that can facilitate the unauthorized access to login and password information for their various online financial accounts, including those at the Company. Such risk has grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties, including foreign state-sponsored parties. For example, these parties send fraudulent “phishing” emails to the Company’s clients in order to misappropriate user names, passwords or other personal information. Losses reimbursed to clients under the Company’s guarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. ﻿ Technology and operational failures or errors could subject the Company to losses, litigation, and regulatory actions. ﻿ The Company must process, record and monitor a large number of transactions and its operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its systems. System interruptions, errors or downtime can result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to its systems, linkages with third-party systems and power failures and can have a significant impact on the Company’s business and operations. The Company’s systems are vulnerable to disruptions from human error, execution errors, errors in models such as those used for asset management, capital planning and management, risk management, stress testing and compliance, employee misconduct, unauthorized trading, external fraud, computer viruses, distributed denial of service attacks, cyber attacks, terrorist attacks, natural disaster, power outage, capacity constraints, software flaws, events impacting key business partners and vendors, and similar events. For example, the Company and other financial institutions have been the target of various denial of service attacks that have, in certain circumstances, made websites, mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time. It could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to the Company’s technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen occurrence, which could affect the Company’s ability to process and settle client transactions. Moreover, instances of fraud or other misconduct might also negatively impact the Company’s reputation and client confidence in the Company, in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances. Despite the Company’s efforts to identify areas of risk, oversee operational areas involving risk, and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks, there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer unexpected losses, reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors, including those of its vendors or other third parties. ﻿ While the Company devotes substantial attention and resources to the reliability, capacity and scalability of its systems, extraordinary trading volumes could cause the Company’s computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail, affecting the Company’s ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients’ orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate. Disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses and decreased client satisfaction. The Company is also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges, clearing houses and other intermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement. Systems failures and constraints and transaction errors at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices, cause substantial losses for the Company and for its clients, and subject the Company to claims from its clients for damages. ﻿ - 12 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION A significant decrease in the Company’s liquidity could negatively affect the Company’s business and financial management as well as reduce client confidence in the Company. ﻿ Maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to the business operations of the Company, including margin lending, mortgage lending, and transaction settlement, among other liquidity needs. The Company meets its liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by client activity and operating earnings, as well as cash provided by external financing. Fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances, as well as changes in regulatory treatment of client deposits or market conditions, may affect the Company’s ability to meet its liquidity needs. A reduction in the Company’s liquidity position could reduce client confidence in the Company, which could result in the loss of client accounts, or could cause the Company to fail to satisfy its liquidity requirements, including the modified LCR. In addition, if the Company’s broker-dealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines, regulators could limit the subsidiaries’ operations or their ability to upstream funds to CSC, which could reduce CSC’s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt and pay cash dividends. In addition, CSC may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries. ﻿ Factors which may adversely affect the Company’s liquidity position include Schwab having temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances, unanticipated outflows of company cash, fluctuations in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts, a dramatic increase in the Company’s client lending activities (including margin, mortgage-related, and personal lending), increased capital requirements, changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations, other regulatory changes, or a loss of market or client confidence in the Company. ﻿ When cash generated by client activity and operating earnings is not sufficient for the Company’s liquidity needs, the Company may seek external financing. During periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets, potential sources of external financing could be reduced, and borrowing costs could increase. Although CSC and Schwab maintain committed and uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines and CSC has a commercial paper issuance program, as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC which can be used to sell securities, financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets. In addition, a significant downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets. ﻿ The Company may suffer significant losses from its credit exposures. ﻿ The Company’s businesses are subject to the risk that a client, counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations, or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to manage this risk, the policies and procedures may not be fully effective. The Company’s exposure mainly results from margin lending, clients’ options trading, futures activities, securities lending, mortgage lending, pledged asset lending, its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities, and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds the Company sponsors. ﻿ When clients purchase securities on margin, borrow on lines of credit collateralized by securities, or trade options or futures, the Company is subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their accounts falls below the amount of clients’ indebtedness. Abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses. ﻿ The Company has exposure to credit risk associated with its investments. Those investments are subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the financial market’s assessment of credit quality. Loss of value of securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such securities are other than temporarily impaired. The evaluation of whether other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) exists is a matter of judgment, which includes the assessment of several factors. If management determines that a security is OTTI, the cost basis of the security may be adjusted and a corresponding loss may be recognized in current earnings. Deterioration in the performance of available for sale (AFS) and held to maturity (HTM) securities could result in the recognition of future impairment charges. Even if a security is not considered OTTI, if the Company was ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity needs, the Company would have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time. See Critical Accounting Estimates in Part II, Item 7 for additional information. ﻿ - 13 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION The Company’s bank loans primarily consist of First Mortgages, HELOCs, and PALs. Increases in delinquency and default rates, housing and stock price declines, increases in the unemployment rate, and other economic factors can result in charges for loan loss reserves and write downs on such loans. ﻿ Heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments (concentration risk) can increase the Company’s risk of loss. Examples of the Company’s credit concentration risk include: ﻿ · Large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry; · Mortgage loans and HELOCs to banking clients which are secured by properties in the same geographic region; and · Margin, pledged asset, and securities lending activities collateralized by securities of a single issuer or industry. ﻿ The Company sponsors a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds. Although the Company has no obligation to do so, the Company may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit, liquidity or other support to its funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity. Such support could cause the Company to take significant charges, could reduce the Company’s liquidity and, in certain situations, could, with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds, result in the Company having to consolidate a supported fund in its financial statements. If the Company chose not to provide credit, liquidity or other support in such a situation, the Company could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected. ﻿ The Company is subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending itself against claims or proceedings. ﻿ The financial services industry faces significant litigation and regulatory risks. The Company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages. The Company is also the subject of inquiries, investigations, and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies. ﻿ Litigation and arbitration claims include those brought by the Company’s clients and the clients of third party advisors whose assets are custodied at the Company. Claims from clients of third party advisors may allege losses due to investment decisions made by the third party advisors or the advisors’ misconduct. Litigation claims also include claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights (e.g., patents). Such litigation can require the expenditure of significant Company resources. If the Company were found to have infringed on a third-party patent, or other intellectual property rights, it could incur substantial damages, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology, or providing certain products or services. ﻿ Actions brought against the Company may result in settlements, awards, injunctions, fines, penalties or other results adverse to the Company including reputational harm. Even if the Company is successful in defending against these actions, the defense of such matters may result in the Company incurring significant expenses. A substantial judgment, settlement, fine, or penalty could be material to the Company’s operating results or cash flows for a particular future period, depending on the Company’s results for that period. In market downturns, the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased. See Item 8 – Note 14 for more information on contingencies. ﻿ The Company relies on outsourced service providers to perform key functions. ﻿ The Company relies on external service providers to perform certain key technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. These service providers face technology, operating, business, and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of the Company’s confidential client, employee, or company information, could cause the Company to incur losses and could harm the Company’s reputation. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider as a result of systems failures, capacity constraints, financial difficulties or for any other reason, and the Company’s inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could disrupt the Company’s operations, impact the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services, and result in financial losses to the Company. Switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations. - 14 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION ﻿ Potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on the Company’s financial position. ﻿ The Company evaluates potential strategic transactions, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions. Any such transaction could have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The process of evaluating, negotiating, and effecting any such strategic transaction may divert management’s attention from other business concerns, and might cause the loss of key clients, employees, and business partners. Moreover, integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties, including the need to integrate operational, financial, and management information systems and management controls, integrate relationships with clients and business partners, and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas. In addition, an acquisition may cause the Company to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings. Further, the Company may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition, and any future acquisition could be dilutive to the Company’s current stockholders’ percentage ownership or to earnings per common share (EPS). ﻿ The Company’s acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in the business, operations or financial condition of the entity being acquired or sold. To the extent the Company enters into an agreement to buy or sell an entity, there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected, or at all. If a material transaction does not close, the Company’s stock price could decline. ﻿ The Company’s industry is characterized by aggressive price competition. ﻿ The Company continually monitors its pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjusts trade commission rates, interest rates on deposits and loans, fees for advisory services, expense ratios on mutual funds and ETFs and other pricing to enhance its competitive position. Increased price competition from other financial services firms, such as reduced commissions to attract trading volume or higher deposit rates to attract client cash balances, could impact the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. ﻿ The Company faces competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees. ﻿ The market for qualified personnel in the Company’s business is highly competitive. At various times, different functions and roles are in especially high demand in the market, compelling the Company to pay more to attract talent. The Company’s ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon its ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs. ﻿ The Company’s stock price has fluctuated historically, and may continue to fluctuate. ﻿ The Company’s stock price can be volatile. Among the factors that may affect the volatility of the Company’s stock price are the following: ﻿ · The Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates; · Speculation in the investment community or the press about, or actual changes in, the Company’s competitive position, organizational structure, executive team, operations, financial condition, financial reporting and results, expense discipline, or strategic transactions; · The announcement of new products, services, acquisitions, or dispositions by the Company or its competitors; and · Increases or decreases in revenue or earnings, changes in earnings estimates by the investment community, and variations between estimated financial results and actual financial results. ﻿ Changes in the stock market generally, or as it concerns the Company’s industry, as well as geopolitical, corporate, regulatory, business, and economic factors may also affect the Company’s stock price. ﻿ Future sales of CSC’s equity securities may adversely affect the market price of CSC’s common stock and result in dilution. ﻿ CSC’s certificate of incorporation authorizes CSC’s Board of Directors, among other things, to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities, without stockholder approval. - 15 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION CSC may issue additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital or for other purposes. The issuance of any additional equity or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of CSC’s common stock and may adversely affect the market price of CSC’s common stock. ﻿ ﻿ Item 1B.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of ﻿ Operations ﻿ FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ﻿ In addition to historical information, this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “will,” “may,” “estimate,” “appear,” “aim,” “target,” “seek”, “could,” “would,” “continue,” and other similar expressions. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. ﻿ These forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s beliefs, objectives, and expectations as of the date hereof, are estimates based on the best judgment of the Company’s senior management. These statements relate to, among other things: ﻿ · The Company’s aim to maximize its market valuation and stockholder returns over time; the Company’s belief that developing trusted relationships will translate into more client assets which drives revenue and, along with expense discipline, generates earnings growth and builds stockholder value; and the Company’s ability to pursue its business strategy and maintain its market leadership position; (see Business Strategy and Competitive Environment in Part I, Item 1); · The impact of legal proceedings and regulatory matters (see Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3 and Item 8 – Note 14); · The adjustment of rates paid on client-related liabilities; the stability, rate sensitivity, and duration of client-related liabilities; the opportunity to migrate non-rate sensitive cash in sweep money market funds to Schwab Bank; increasing the duration of interest-earning assets; and the Company’s positioning to benefit from an increase in interest rates and limit its exposure to falling rates; (see Net Interest Revenue in Part II, Item 7); · Sources of liquidity, capital, and level of dividends (see Liquidity Risk in Part II, Item 7); · Capital ratios (see Capital Management in Part II, Item 7); · The impact of changes in management’s estimates on the Company’s results of operations (see Critical Accounting Estimates in Part II, Item 7); · The expected impact of new accounting standards not yet adopted (see Item 8 – Note 2); and · The impact of changes in the likelihood of indemnification and guarantee payment obligations on the Company’s results of operations (see Item 8 – Note 14). ﻿ Achievement of the expressed beliefs, objectives and expectations described in these statements is subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expressed beliefs, objectives, and expectations.

Management believes that metrics relating to net new and total client assets, as well as client cash levels and utilization of advisory services, offer perspective on the Company’s business momentum and client engagement. Data on new and total client brokerage accounts provides additional perspective on the Company’s ability to attract and retain new business. Management believes that net revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin, EPS, and return on average common stockholders’ equity provide broad indicators of the Company’s overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns. Management considers expenses, excluding interest, as a percentage of average client assets to be a measure of operating efficiency. Finally, management believes the Consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint currently imposed by regulators. Results for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 are: ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ Growth Rate ﻿ 1-Year ﻿ 2015-2016 2016 2015 2014 Client Metrics: Net new client assets (in billions) (10) % $ 125.5 $ 139.4 $ 124.8 Core net new client assets (in billions) (1) (7) % $ 125.5 $ 134.7 $ 124.8 Client assets (in billions, at year end) 11 % $ 2,779.5 $ 2,513.8 $ 2,463.6 Average client assets (in billions) 3 % $ 2,614.7 $ 2,531.8 $ 2,384.0 New brokerage accounts (in thousands) 2 % 1,093 1,070 972 Active brokerage accounts (in thousands, at year end) 4 % 10,155 9,769 9,386 Assets receiving ongoing advisory services (in billions, at year end) 12 % $ 1,401.4 $ 1,253.7 $ 1,228.1 Client cash as a percentage of client assets (at year end) 13.0 % 13.0 % 12.3 % Company Financial Metrics: Net revenues 17 % $ 7,478 $ 6,380 $ 6,058 Expenses excluding interest 9 % 4,485 4,101 3,943 Income before taxes on income 31 % 2,993 2,279 2,115 Taxes on income 33 % 1,104 832 794 Net income 31 % $ 1,889 $ 1,447 $ 1,321 Preferred stock dividends and other 72 % 143 83 60 Net income available to common stockholders 28 % $ 1,746 $ 1,364 $ 1,261 Earnings per common share – diluted 27 % $ 1.31 $ 1.03 $ .95 Net revenue growth from prior year 17 % 5 % 11 % Pre-tax profit margin 40.0 % 35.7 % 34.9 % Return on average common stockholders’ equity 14 % 12 % 12 % Expenses excluding interest as a percentage of average client assets 0.17 % 0.16 % 0.17 % Consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio 7.2 % 7.1 % N/A ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ (1) 2015 excludes an inflow of $6.1 billion to reflect the final impact of the consolidation of its retirement plan recordkeeping platforms, an inflow of $10.2 million relating to a mutual fund clearing services client, and an outflow of $11.6 billion relating to the Company’s planned resignation from an Advisor Services cash management relationship netting to an adjustment of ($4.7) billion. N/A Not applicable. ﻿ The Company’s financial results are highly correlated to the general overall strength of economic conditions and, more specifically, to the direction of the U.S. equity and fixed income markets, interest rates, the mortgage lending markets and residential credit trends. These factors, as well as political and regulatory trends and industry competition, are unpredictable. - 25 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) ﻿ 2016 Compared to 2015 ﻿ In 2016, net income available to common stockholders increased $382 million, or 28%, from the prior year, resulting in diluted EPS of $1.31 in 2016 compared to $1.03 in 2015. Net revenues improved by $1.1 billion, or 17%, while expenses excluding interest increased $384 million, or 9%, compared to 2015. ﻿ Strong client momentum continued as the Company’s innovative, full-service model resonated with clients and drove growth during the year. The Company added 1.1 million new brokerage accounts to its client base during 2016, which contributed to bringing the total active brokerage accounts to 10.2 million by year-end. Core net new assets from new and existing clients totaled $125.5 billion in 2016, which helped grow total client assets to $2.78 trillion as of December 31, 2016. Also during 2016, investors increasingly turned to the Company’s advice offerings resulting in a 12% increase in client assets enrolled in one of the Company’s retail advisory solutions and those guided by independent advisors, to $1.40 trillion at the end of the year. ﻿ The Company expanded client assets by 11% during an environment that had periods of marked volatility, but ultimately included improving economic conditions. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index ended 2016 10% higher than the prior year end. After years of ultra-low interest rates, the Federal Reserve’s move to increase the overnight federal funds target rate by 25 basis points in December 2015 helped throughout 2016; the Federal Reserve’s subsequent additional 25 basis point increase in December 2016 had little time to impact 2016 results. Other short-term rates also rose in 2016. The one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) improved 34 basis points to .77% at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015. ﻿ These external drivers and the solid client growth helped produce strong net revenue growth. The Company’s 17% net revenue growth was led by increased net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees, which more than offset lower revenue from trading and other revenue. Net interest revenue improved $797 million, or 32%, in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a 21% increase in average interest earning assets and a 13 basis point improvement in the average net interest margin from year to year, to 1.73%. The lift in interest-earning assets was due to a combination of the Company’s ongoing asset gathering efforts, additional bulk transfers of client cash sweep balances from money market funds to Schwab Bank, and the designation of Schwab Bank as the default sweep option for virtually all new brokerage accounts as of June 2016. Asset management and administration fees improved $405 million, or 15%, primarily due to higher short-term interest rates affecting the yield on money market funds. ﻿ Strong net revenue growth provided room for increased investment in people and technology, resulting in a 9% expense growth for 2016. This increase allowed for a 780 basis point gap between net revenue and expense growth and a pre-tax profit margin of 40.0% in 2016, compared to 35.7% in 2015. ﻿ 2015 Compared to 2014 ﻿ In 2015, the Company’s net revenue and net income grew despite an environment that included significant equity market volatility and continued low interest rates. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined as much as 9% during the year and ultimately ended the year down 1% when compared to the prior year. The overnight federal funds target rate increased 25 basis points in December 2015; however, the increase had limited effect on 2015 results. The year end 2015 one-month LIBOR yield improved 28 basis points to .43% compared to 2014. Long-term interest rates decreased in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The average 10-year U.S. Treasury yield during 2015 was 2.13%, 40 basis points lower than the average yield during 2014. ﻿ Core net new assets totaled $134.7 billion in 2015 compared to $124.8 billion in 2014. Total client assets ended 2015 at $2.51 trillion, up 2% from the year ended 2014, despite the $89.2 billion impact of reduced market valuation on client assets during the year. ﻿ The Company added 1.1 million new brokerage accounts to its client base during 2015, up 10% compared to 2014. Active brokerage accounts ended 2015 at 9.8 million, up 4% on a year-over-year basis. Faced with economic uncertainty and the resulting market volatility, investors increasingly turned to advice offerings throughout the year. Over 155,000 accounts enrolled in one of the Company’s retail advisory solutions during 2015, 60% more than the year-earlier period, and total accounts using these solutions reached 560,000, up 14% year-over-year. - 26 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) During 2015, the Company’s net revenues increased 5% compared to 2014 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees, partially offset by a decrease in trading revenue. ﻿ Growth in expenses excluding interest was limited to a 4% increase in 2015 primarily reflecting business growth related increases in compensation, benefits and other expenses. ﻿ The combined effect of market conditions, strong business growth, and the Company’s overall spending discipline resulted in a pre-tax profit margin of 35.7% in 2015. ﻿ Subsequent Event ﻿ On January 26, 2017, the Company announced that Mr. Peter Crawford, Executive Vice President – Finance, will succeed Mr. Joseph R. Martinetto as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, effective May 16, 2017. ﻿ Mr. Martinetto will continue as Senior Executive Vice President at CSC, maintaining oversight of several functions including the Company’s banking, technology and operations units. ﻿ Current Regulatory Environment and Other Developments ﻿ In September 2016, the OCC issued final guidelines for recovery planning by national banks and federal savings banks with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The guidelines require each bank to develop and maintain a recovery plan that describes how the bank will restore itself to financial health and viability in response to a wide range of external and internal financial and operational stress scenarios. The guidelines went into effect on January 1, 2017, and Schwab Bank has until the end of 2017 to develop and prepare a recovery plan. ﻿ In May 2016, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC jointly issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would impose a minimum NSFR on certain banking organizations, including CSC. The effective date of the rule would be January 1, 2018. The comment period for the proposed rule ended on August 5, 2016 and the impact to the Company cannot be assessed until the final rule is released. ﻿ In October 2015, the Federal Reserve issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity and long-term debt that, among other things, would have required certain financial institutions that are subject to the Federal Reserve’s capital rules to deduct from their regulatory capital the amount of any investments in or exposure to unsecured debt issued by U.S. bank holding companies identified as global systemically important banking organizations (GSIBs). In December 2016, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule that did not include this regulatory capital deduction proposal. At the same time, the Federal Reserve did indicate its intent to work with the OCC and FDIC to develop a proposed interagency approach towards the regulatory capital treatment of GSIB unsecured debt. The Company will evaluate any such proposal when it is issued. ﻿ ﻿ - 27 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ﻿ Net Revenues ﻿ ﻿ Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 ﻿ % of % of % of ﻿ Growth Rate Total Net Total Net Total Net ﻿ 2015-2016 Amount Revenues Amount Revenues Amount Revenues Asset management and administration fees Mutual fund and ETF service fees 25 % $ 1,853 25 % $ 1,479 23 % $ 1,413 23 % Advice solutions 2 % 915 12 % 898 14 % 840 14 % Other 5 % 287 4 % 273 4 % 280 5 % Asset management and administration fees 15 % 3,055 41 % 2,650 41 % 2,533 42 % Net interest revenue Interest revenue 31 % 3,493 46 % 2,657 42 % 2,374 39 % Interest expense 30 % (171) (2) % (132) (2) % (102) (1) % Net interest revenue 32 % 3,322 44 % 2,525 40 % 2,272 38 % Trading revenue Commissions (5) % 779 10 % 822 13 % 857 14 % Principal transactions 5 % 46 1 % 44 1 % 50 1 % Trading revenue (5) % 825 11 % 866 14 % 907 15 % Other (17) % 271 4 % 328 5 % 343 5 % Provision for loan losses (55) % 5 - 11 - 4 - Net impairment losses on securities - - - - - (1) - Total net revenues 17 % $ 7,478 100 % $ 6,380 100 % $ 6,058 100 % ﻿ ﻿ Asset Management and Administration Fees ﻿ Asset management and administration fees include mutual fund and ETF service fees and fees for other asset-based financial services provided to individual and institutional clients. The Company earns mutual fund and ETF service fees for shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. Asset management and administration fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in these funds and do not include securities lending revenues earned by proprietary mutual funds and ETFs, as those amounts, net of program fees, are credited to the fund shareholders. The fair values of client assets included in proprietary and third-party mutual funds and ETFs are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data. ﻿ The Company also earns asset management fees for advice solutions, which include managed portfolios, specialized strategies and customized investment advice. Other asset management and administration fees include various asset-based fees such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, mutual fund clearing fees, collective trust fund fees, and non-balance based service and transaction fees. ﻿ Asset management and administration fees vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity.

(4) Includes miscellaneous service and transaction fees relating to mutual funds and ETFs that are not balance-based. ﻿ Asset management and administration fees increased by $405 million, or 15%, in 2016 from 2015, and by $117 million, or 5%, in 2015 from 2014. The increases in both years were due to higher net yields on money market fund assets as short-term interest rates rose in 2016 and 2015, and growth in client assets enrolled in advisory offers, partially offset by a reduction in client assets in Mutual Fund OneSource. ﻿ The average fee rate on advice solutions decreased in 2016 and 2015 from the prior years primarily due to the growth in Intelligent Portfolios, which do not charge advisory fees. Net Interest Revenue ﻿ The Company’s primary interest-earning assets include cash and cash equivalents; segregated cash and investments; margin loans, which constitute the majority of receivables from brokerage clients; investment securities; and bank loans. Revenue on interest-earning assets is affected by various factors, such as the composition of assets, prevailing interest rates at the time of origination or purchase, changes in interest rates on floating rate securities, and changes in prepayment levels for mortgage-related securities and loans. Fees earned on securities borrowing and lending activities, which are conducted by the - 29 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Company’s broker-dealer subsidiaries on assets held in client brokerage accounts, are included in other interest revenue and expense. ﻿ The Company’s interest-bearing liabilities include bank deposits, payables to brokerage clients, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt. The Company establishes the rates paid on client-related liabilities, and management expects that it will generally adjust the rates paid on these liabilities at some fraction of any movement in short-term rates. Client-related liabilities have historically been very stable and are largely expected to remain so. Given the stability and low rate sensitivity of these liabilities, management believes their duration is relatively long, somewhere in excess of three and a half years. ﻿ Management believes that the extended period of extraordinarily low interest rates running from the financial crisis to the present has likely resulted in certain sweep cash balances retaining some level of latent rate sensitivity. To the extent short-term rates increase, management expects some sweep cash balances to migrate to purchased money market funds or other higher-yielding alternatives. At the same time, the Company will retain the opportunity to migrate the remaining non-rate sensitive cash in sweep money market funds to Schwab Bank. ﻿ Management has positioned the Company to benefit from an increase in interest rates, especially short-term interest rates, by managing the duration of interest-earning assets to be shorter than that of interest-bearing liabilities, so that asset yields will move faster than liability costs. ﻿ In order to keep the Company’s interest-rate sensitivity within established limits, management monitors and responds to changes in the balance sheet. As the Company builds its client base, it attracts a significant amount of new client sweep cash, which, along with the bulk transfer of existing sweep cash balances from money market funds, is a primary driver of balance sheet growth. As the proportion of sweep cash balances to total liabilities has grown, the measured duration of liabilities has grown as well. By increasing the duration of interest-earning assets as necessary, management has kept the Company positioned to continue to gain from increasing rates while limiting its exposure to falling rates to an acceptable level. Management currently manages the balance sheet so that just over half of the Company’s investment securities and loans re-price or reset based on short-term interest rates such as one-month LIBOR. ﻿ Non-interest-bearing funding sources include certain cash balances, stockholders’ equity and other miscellaneous assets and liabilities. ﻿ - 30 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The following table presents net interest revenue information corresponding to interest-earning assets and funding sources on the consolidated balance sheets: ﻿ ﻿ Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 ﻿ Interest Average Interest Average Interest Average ﻿ Average Revenue/ Yield/ Average Revenue/ Yield/ Average Revenue/ Yield/ ﻿ Balance Expense Rate Balance Expense Rate Balance Expense Rate Interest-earning assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 11,143 $ 57 0.51 % $ 9,358 $ 24 0.26 % $ 7,179 $ 16 0.22 % Cash and investments segregated 20,104 93 0.46 % 18,606 31 0.17 % 20,268 24 0.12 % Broker-related receivables (1) 558 1 0.22 % 274 - 0.07 % 325 - 0.09 % Receivables from brokerage clients 15,001 497 3.31 % 15,212 502 3.30 % 13,778 482 3.50 % Available for sale securities (2) 72,586 883 1.22 % 62,249 629 1.01 % 52,057 546 1.05 % Held to maturity securities 57,451 1,402 2.44 % 38,280 957 2.50 % 32,361 828 2.56 % Bank loans 14,715 400 2.72 % 13,973 369 2.64 % 12,906 355 2.75 % Total interest-earning assets 191,558 3,333 1.74 % 157,952 2,512 1.59 % 138,874 2,251 1.62 % Other interest revenue 160 145 123 Total interest-earning assets $ 191,558 $ 3,493 1.82 % $ 157,952 $ 2,657 1.68 % $ 138,874 $ 2,374 1.71 % Funding sources: Bank deposits $ 141,432 $ 37 0.03 % $ 113,464 $ 29 0.03 % $ 95,842 $ 30 0.03 % Payables to brokerage clients 26,311 3 0.01 % 25,651 2 0.01 % 26,731 2 0.01 % Short-term borrowings (1,3) 1,864 9 0.48 % 21 - 0.27 % 5 - 0.15 % Long-term debt (4) 2,876 104 3.62 % 2,717 92 3.39 % 1,893 73 3.86 % Total interest-bearing liabilities (4) 172,483 153 0.09 % 141,853 123 0.09 % 124,471 105 0.08 % Non-interest-bearing funding sources (3) 19,075 16,099 14,403 Other interest expense 18 9 (3) Total funding sources $ 191,558 $ 171 0.09 % $ 157,952 $ 132 0.08 % $ 138,874 $ 102 0.07 % Net interest revenue $ 3,322 1.73 % $ 2,525 1.60 % $ 2,272 1.64 % ﻿ (1) Interest revenue or expense was less than $500,000 in the period or periods presented.

See Item 8 – Note 2. ﻿ Net interest revenue increased $797 million, or 32%, in 2016 from 2015 due primarily to higher interest-earning assets driven by growth in bank deposits. The Company has grown bank deposits through a combination of: ﻿ · Gathering additional assets from new and current clients; · Transferring uninvested cash balances in certain client brokerage accounts to Schwab Bank; and · Establishing the Schwab Bank sweep feature as the default investment option for uninvested cash balances within all new brokerage accounts as of June 2016. ﻿ The Company has invested the cash from the growth in bank deposits and from recent short-term borrowings in investment securities. These incremental investments, coupled with an increase in short-term interest rates, have resulted in a 13 basis point improvement in the net interest margin to 1.73% in 2016. ﻿ Net interest revenue increased $253 million, or 11%, in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the effect of lower net interest margins. The growth in the average balances in bank deposits resulted from an increase in the uninvested cash balances in certain client brokerage accounts swept to Schwab Bank. Trading Revenue ﻿ Trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenue is affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. Principal transaction revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from trading activity in fixed income securities with clients. To accommodate clients’ fixed income trading activity, the Company maintains positions in fixed income securities, including U.S. state and municipal debt obligations, U.S. Government and corporate debt, and other securities. The difference between the price at which the - 31 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Company buys and sells securities to and from its clients and other broker-dealers is recognized as principal transaction revenue. Principal transaction revenue also includes adjustments to the fair value of these securities positions. ﻿ The following table presents trading revenue and the related drivers: ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ Growth Rate Year Ended December 31, 2015-2016 2016 2015 2014 Daily average revenue trades (in thousands) - 291.6 292.0 298.2 Clients’ daily average trades (in thousands) 5 % 561.8 536.9 516.8 Number of trading days - 251.5 251.0 250.5 Average revenue per revenue trade (5) % $ 11.23 $ 11.83 $ 12.13 Trading revenue (5) % $ 825 $ 866 $ 907 ﻿ Trading revenue decreased in both 2016 and 2015 by $41 million primarily due to a decrease in commission revenue as a result of lower commissions per revenue trade. ﻿ Daily average revenue trades remained relatively flat in 2016 from 2015. Daily average revenue trades decreased in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to a lower volume of equity trades. Average revenue per revenue trade decreased 5% in 2016 compared to 2015, due to a higher proportion of trades from active traders, who typically pay a lower commission rate, as well as increased client utilization of discounted trade offers. Average revenue per revenue trade decreased 2% in 2015 compared to 2014. Over time, the percentage of trading revenue has declined from a peak of 50%-60% of total net revenue in the early 1990s to the current low of 11% at December 31, 2016. ﻿ Other Revenue ﻿ Other revenue includes order flow revenue, other service fees, software fees from the Company’s portfolio management solutions, exchange processing fees, and nonrecurring gains. ﻿ Other revenue decreased by $57 million, or 17%, in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to lower litigation proceeds of $16 million in 2016 compared to $75 million in 2015 related to the Company’s non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) portfolio. Order flow revenue was $103 million during both 2016 and 2015. ﻿ Other revenue decreased by $15 million, or 4%, in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower order flow revenue. Order flow revenue was $103 million during 2015 compared to $114 million during 2014. The decrease was primarily due to changes in the composition and volume of different types of orders and the fees and rebates for such orders. Other revenue in 2015 also includes net litigation proceeds of $75 million related to the Company’s non-agency RMBS portfolio. Other revenue in 2014 includes a net insurance settlement of $45 million and net litigation proceeds of $28 million related to the Company’s non-agency RMBS portfolio. ﻿ ﻿ - 32 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Expenses Excluding Interest ﻿ The following table shows a comparison of expenses excluding interest: ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ Growth Rate Year Ended December 31, 2015-2016 2016 2015 2014 Compensation and benefits 10 % $ 2,466 $ 2,241 $ 2,184 Professional services 10 % 506 459 457 Occupancy and equipment 13 % 398 353 324 Advertising and market development 6 % 265 249 245 Communications 2 % 237 233 223 Depreciation and amortization 4 % 234 224 199 Other 11 % 379 342 311 Total expenses excluding interest 9 % $ 4,485 $ 4,101 $ 3,943 Expenses as a percentage of total net revenues: Compensation and benefits 33 % 35 % 36 % Advertising and market development 4 % 4 % 4 % ﻿ Compensation and Benefits ﻿ Compensation and benefits expense includes salaries and wages, incentive compensation, and related employee benefits. Incentive compensation includes variable compensation, discretionary bonuses, and share-based compensation. Variable compensation includes payments to certain individuals based on their sales performance. Discretionary bonuses are based on the Company’s overall performance as measured by EPS. Share-based compensation primarily includes employee and board of director stock options and restricted stock. ﻿ The following table shows a comparison of certain compensation and benefits components and employee data: ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ Growth Rate Year Ended December 31, 2015-2016 2016 2015 2014 Salaries and wages 9 % $ 1,368 $ 1,258 $ 1,245 Incentive compensation 11 % 689 618 605 Employee benefits and other 12 % 409 365 334 Total compensation and benefits expense 10 % $ 2,466 $ 2,241 $ 2,184 Full-time equivalent employees (in thousands) At year end 6 % 16.2 15.3 14.6 Average 5 % 15.9 15.1 14.2 ﻿ Salaries and wages increased in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to higher employee headcount to support the growth in the business and annual salary increases. Incentive compensation increased in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to higher discretionary bonus expenses, long-term incentive plan costs, and field incentive plan costs relating to increased net client asset flows. Employee benefits and other expense increased in 2016 from 2015 due to increases in healthcare costs and higher employee headcount. ﻿ Salaries and wages increased in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to higher employee headcount and annual salary increases, partially offset by a $68 million charge in 2014 for estimated future severance benefits resulting from changes in the Company’s geographic footprint. Incentive compensation increased in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to the earlier recognition of certain equity-based incentives due to plan changes offset by a reduction in long-term incentive plan expenses. Employee benefits and other expense increased in 2015 from 2014 due to increases in healthcare costs and higher employee headcount. ﻿ - 33 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Expenses Excluding Compensation and Benefits ﻿ Professional services expense increased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to higher spending on technology services and an increase in fees paid to outsourced service providers and consultants as the Company continued to invest in the business. Professional services remained relatively flat in 2015 compared to 2014. ﻿ Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2016 and 2015 from the prior year primarily due to increased software maintenance expense relating to the Company’s information technology systems and an increase in property taxes and rent attributable to the ongoing growth in the Company’s geographic footprint. ﻿ Advertising and market development, communications, and depreciation and amortization expenses combined grew a modest 4% in 2016 and 6% in 2015, from the prior years as a result of growth in the business, new product media campaigns and higher amortization of internally developed software associated with the Company’s investment in software and technology enhancements. ﻿ The Company’s capital expenditures were $353 million, $285 million, and $405 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures in 2016 from 2015 was primarily due to higher investment in land and internal-use software, partially offset by a decrease in investment in buildings. The decrease in capital expenditures in 2015 from 2014 was primarily due to lower investment in buildings and land relating to the growth in the Company’s geographic footprint beginning in 2014. Capitalized costs for developing internal-use software were $130 million, $107 million, and $81 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014. ﻿ Other expense increased in 2016 and 2015 from the prior year primarily due to an increase in the Company’s FDIC insurance assessments which rose as a result of higher bank deposits and the effect of a new surcharge that commenced in the third quarter of 2016. Taxes on Income ﻿ The Company’s effective income tax rate was 36.9% in 2016, 36.5% in 2015, and 37.5% in 2014. The 2016 effective income tax rate includes tax benefits on tax exempt income from investments in U.S. state and municipal securities. ﻿ The 2015 effective income tax rate includes the recognition of net tax benefits relating to certain current and prior-year matters. Segment Information ﻿ The Company provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments – Investor Services and Advisor Services. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services, retirement plan services, and other corporate brokerage services. The Advisor Services segment provides custodial, trading, banking, and support services as well as retirement business services. Revenues and expenses are attributed to the Company’s two segments based on which segment services the client. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments on a pre-tax basis. Segment assets and liabilities are not used for evaluating segment performance or in deciding how to allocate resources to segments. Net revenues in both segments are generated from the underlying client assets and trading activity; differences in the composition of net revenues between the segments are based on the composition of client assets, client trading frequency, and pricing unique to each. While both segments leverage the scale and efficiency of the Company’s platforms, segment expenses reflect the dynamics of serving millions of clients in Investor Services versus the thousands of RIAs on the advisor platform. ﻿ ﻿ - 34 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Financial information for the Company’s reportable segments is presented in the following tables: ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ Investor Services (1) Advisor Services (1) ﻿ Growth Rate Growth Rate Year Ended December 31, 2015-2016 2016 2015 2014 2015-2016 2016 2015 2014 Net Revenues Asset management and administration fees 14 % $ 2,093 $ 1,837 $ 1,742 18 % $ 962 $ 813 $ 791 Net interest revenue 21 % 2,591 2,133 2,028 86 % 731 392 244 Trading revenue (6) % 524 556 606 (3) % 301 310 301 Other (15) % 199 234 218 (23) % 72 94 74 Provision for loan losses (64) % 4 11 4 - 1 - - Net impairment losses on securities - - - (1) - - - - Total net revenues 13 % 5,411 4,771 4,597 28 % 2,067 1,609 1,410 Expenses Excluding Interest 9 % 3,380 3,090 2,937 9 % 1,105 1,011 938 Income before taxes on income 21 % $ 2,031 $ 1,681 $ 1,660 61 % $ 962 $ 598 $ 472 ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ Unallocated Total ﻿ Growth Rate Growth Rate Year Ended December 31, 2015-2016 2016 2015 2014 2015-2016 2016 2015 2014 Net Revenues Asset management and administration fees $ - $ - $ - 15 % $ 3,055 $ 2,650 $ 2,533 Net interest revenue - - - 32 % 3,322 2,525 2,272 Trading revenue - - - (5) % 825 866 907 Other - - 51 (17) % 271 328 343 Provision for loan losses - - - (55) % 5 11 4 Net impairment losses on securities - - - - - - (1) Total net revenues - - 51 17 % 7,478 6,380 6,058 Expenses Excluding Interest - - 68 9 % 4,485 4,101 3,943 Income before taxes on income $ - $ - $ (17) 31 % $ 2,993 $ 2,279 $ 2,115 ﻿ ﻿ (1) The Corporate Brokerage Retirement Services business was transferred from the Investor Services segment to the Advisor Services segment in the fourth quarter of 2015. Prior period information has been recast to reflect these changes. ﻿ Investor Services Net revenues increased by $640 million, or 13%, in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher balances of interest-earning assets and higher interest rates on those assets. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to higher net yields on money market fund assets, partially offset by a reduction in client assets in Mutual Fund OneSource®. Expenses excluding interest increased by $290 million, or 9%, in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to growth in the business resulting in increases in compensation and benefits, depreciation and amortization, and occupancy and equipment expenses. ﻿ Net revenues increased by $174 million, or 4%, in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue, asset management and administration fees, and other revenue, partially offset by a decrease in trading revenue. Net interest revenue increased mainly due to higher balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the effect of lower net interest margins. - 35 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to fees from advice solutions, which increased mainly due to growth in client assets enrolled in advisory offers. Other revenue increased primarily due to litigation proceeds relating to the Company’s non-agency RMBS portfolio. Trading revenue decreased in 2015 from 2014 largely due to lower commissions per revenue trade and lower daily average revenue trades. Expenses excluding interest increased by $153 million, or 5%, in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to growth in the business resulting in increases in compensation and benefits and other expenses. ﻿ Advisor Services Net revenues increased by $458 million, or 28%, in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher balances of interest-earning assets and higher interest rates on those assets. This growth in assets was bolstered by the migration of more uninvested client cash balances in the segment to Schwab Bank. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to higher net yields on money market fund assets. Expenses excluding interest increased by $94 million, or 9%, in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to increases in growth in the business resulting in increases in compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment, and other expenses. ﻿ Net revenues increased by $199 million, or 14%, in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue, asset management and administration fees, and other revenue. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the effect of lower net interest margins. Interest-earning assets have grown due to growth in brokerage client cash swept to Schwab Bank. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to higher net yields on money market fund assets and growth in client assets in equity and bond funds. Other revenue increased primarily due to litigation proceeds relating to the Company’s non-agency RMBS portfolio. Expenses excluding interest increased by $73 million, or 8%, in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to increases in growth in the business resulting in increases in compensation and benefits, advertising and marketing, other expenses. ﻿ Unallocated Other revenue decreased in 2015 from 2014 due to a net insurance settlement of $45 million in 2014. ﻿ Expenses excluding interest decreased in 2015 from 2014 as a result of a $68 million charge in 2014 for estimated future severance benefits resulting from changes in the Company’s geographic footprint. ﻿ Risk MANAGEMENT ﻿ The Company’s business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, credit, market, liquidity, and compliance risk. The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. Despite the Company’s efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks. ﻿ The Company’s risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting and risk mitigation. The activities and organizations that comprise the risk management process are described below. ﻿ Culture ﻿ The Board of Directors has approved an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework that incorporates the Company’s purpose, vision, and values that form the bedrock of its corporate culture and set the tone for the organization. ﻿ The ERM Framework and governance structure constitute a comprehensive approach to managing risks encountered by the Company in its business activities. The framework incorporates key concepts commensurate with the size, risk profile, complexity, and continuing growth of the Company. Risk appetite, which is defined as the amount of risk the Company is - 36 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) willing to accept in pursuit of its corporate strategy, is developed by executive management and approved by the Board of Directors. ﻿ Risk Governance ﻿ Senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling risks. ﻿ The Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior executives from each major business and control function, is responsible for the oversight of risk management. This includes identifying emerging risks, assessing risk management practices and the control environment, reinforcing business accountability for risk management, supervisory controls and regulatory compliance, supporting resource prioritization across the Company, and escalating significant issues to the Board of Directors. ﻿ The Company has established risk metrics and reporting that enable measurement of the impact of strategy execution against risk appetite. The risk metrics, with risk limits and tolerance levels, are established for key risk categories by the Global Risk Committee and its functional risk sub-committees. ﻿ The Global Risk Committee reports regularly to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. The Risk Committee in turn assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the Company’s risk management program, including approving risk appetite statements and reviewing reports relating to risk issues from functional areas of risk management, legal, compliance, and internal audit. ﻿ Functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report to the Global Risk Committee. These sub-committees include the: ﻿ · Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee – establishes strategies and policies for the management of corporate capital, liquidity, interest rate risk, and investments; · Compliance Risk Committee – provides oversight of compliance risk management programs and policies providing an aggregate view of compliance risk exposure; · Credit and Market Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of and approves credit and market risk policies, limits, and exposures in loan, investment, and positioning portfolios; · New Products and Services Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of, and approves corporate policy and procedures relating to the risk governance of new products and services; and · Operational Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of and approves operational risk management policies, risk tolerance levels, and operational risk governance processes, and includes sub-committees covering Fiduciary, Data, Information Security, Model Governance, and Third-Party risk. ﻿ Senior management has also created an Incentive Compensation Risk Oversight Committee, which establishes policy and reviews and approves the Annual Risk Assessment of incentive compensation plans, and reports directly to the Board Compensation Committee. ﻿ The Company’s compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and corporate risk management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring the Company’s risk management. ﻿ In addition, the Company’s Disclosure Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. ﻿ - 37 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Operational Risk ﻿ Operational risks arise due to potentially inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events and relationships impacting the Company and/or any of its key business partners and third-parties. While operational risk is inherent in all business activities, the Company relies on a system of internal controls and risk management practices designed to keep operational risk and operational losses within the Company’s risk appetite. The Company has specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and uses periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. Where appropriate, the Company manages the impact of operational loss and litigation expense through the purchase of insurance. The insurance program is specifically designed to address the key operational risks of the Company, and to maintain compliance with local laws and regulation. ﻿ The Company’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity and resiliency of its critical business functions and technology systems. To the extent the Company experiences business or system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, technological failure, cyber attacks, changes to systems, linkages with third-party systems, and power failures), the Company’s business and operations could be negatively impacted. To minimize business interruptions, the Company maintains a backup and recovery infrastructure which includes facilities for backup and communications, a geographically dispersed workforce, and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans. ﻿ Information Security risk is the potential for unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, perusal, inspection, recording or destruction of the Company’s information or systems. The Company has designed and implemented an information security program that knits together complementary tools, controls and technologies to protect systems, client accounts and data. The Company continuously monitors the systems and works collaboratively with government agencies, law enforcement and other financial institutions to address potential threats. The Company uses advanced monitoring systems to identify suspicious activity and deter unauthorized access by internal or external actors. The Company limits the number of employees who have access to clients’ personal information and enforces internal authentication measures to protect against the potential for social engineering. All employees who handle sensitive information are trained in privacy and security. Schwab’s fraud and cyber security teams monitor activity looking for suspicious behavior. These capabilities allow the Company to identify and quickly act on any attempted intrusions. ﻿ The Company also faces operational risk when it employs the services of various external vendors, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. The Company manages its exposure to external vendor risk through contractual provisions, control standards, and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance. The Company maintains policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with Company data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-public client information. The Company clearly defines for employees, contractors, and vendors the Company’s expected standards of care for confidential data. Regular training is provided by the Company in regard to data security. ﻿ Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. The Company attempts to manage this risk by establishing procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees. ﻿ Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. Models are owned by several business units throughout the Company, and are used for a variety of purposes. Model use includes, but is not limited to, calculating capital requirements for hypothetical stressful environments, estimating interest and credit risk for loans and other balance sheet assets, and providing guidance in the management of client portfolios. The Company has established a policy to describe the roles and responsibilities of all key stakeholders in model development, management, and use. All models at the Company are registered in a centralized database and classified into different risk - 38 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) ratings depending on their potential financial, reputational, or regulatory impact to the Company. The model risk rating determines the scope of model governance activities. ﻿ Compliance Risk ﻿ The Company faces significant compliance risk in its business, that is, the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, fines or penalties, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, or other regulatory requirements. Among other things, compliance risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for Company products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of the Company’s controls. The Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, including SROs. Such regulation is becoming increasingly extensive and complex, and regulatory proceedings and sanctions against financial services firms continue to increase. ﻿ The Company attempts to manage compliance risk through policies, procedures and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, client privacy, and employment policies. Despite the Company’s efforts to maintain an effective compliance program and internal controls, legal breaches and rule violations could result in reputational harm, significant losses and disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on the Company’s business activities. ﻿ Credit and Concentration Risk ﻿ Credit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform on its contractual obligations. The Company’s exposure to credit risk mainly results from margin lending and client option and futures activities, securities lending activities, mortgage lending activities, pledged asset lending, its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and other investing activities. To manage the risks of such losses, the Company has established policies and procedures, which include establishing and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin, PAL, option, and futures requirements for certain securities. Collateral arrangements relating to margin loans, PALs, option positions, securities lending agreements, and resale agreements include provisions that require additional collateral in the event market fluctuations result in declines in the value of collateral received. Additionally, for margin loan, PAL and securities lending agreements, collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral exceeds the amounts loaned. ﻿ Schwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab’s clients or a counterparty fail to meet their obligations to Schwab. ﻿ The Company’s bank loan portfolio includes First Mortgages, HELOCs, PALs and other loans. The credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual loan and portfolio reviews. Management regularly reviews asset quality, including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for loan losses. ﻿ The Company’s residential loan underwriting guidelines include maximum LTV ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan size is conforming or jumbo). ﻿ The Company does not originate or purchase residential loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. ﻿ The Company’s bank loans include $8.2 billion of adjustable rate First Mortgage loans at December 31, 2016. The Company’s adjustable rate mortgages have initial fixed interest rates for three to ten years and interest rates that adjust - 39 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) annually thereafter. Approximately 36% of these mortgages consisted of loans with interest-only payment terms. The interest rates on approximately 58% of these interest-only loans are not scheduled to reset for three or more years. The Company’s mortgage loans do not include interest terms described as temporary introductory rates below current market rates. ﻿ The Company’s HELOC product has a 30-year loan term with an initial draw period of ten years from the date of origination. After the initial draw period, the balance outstanding at such time is converted to a 20-year amortizing loan. The interest rate during the initial draw period and the 20-year amortizing period is a floating rate based on the prime rate plus a margin. HELOCs that convert to an amortizing loan may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates than those in the initial draw period. The Company’s allowance for loan loss methodology takes this increased inherent risk into consideration. ﻿ The following table presents when current outstanding HELOCs will convert to amortizing loans: ﻿ ﻿ December 31, 2016 Balance Converted to amortizing loan by period end $ 469 Within 1 year 133 > 1 year – 3 years 855 > 3 years – 5 years 203 > 5 years 690 Total $ 2,350 ﻿ At December 31, 2016, $1.8 billion of the HELOC portfolio was secured by second liens on the associated properties. Second lien mortgage loans typically possess a higher degree of credit risk given the subordination to the first lien holder in the event of default. In addition to the credit monitoring activities described previously, the Company also monitors credit risk by reviewing the delinquency status of the first lien loan on the associated property. At December 31, 2016, approximately 39% of the HELOC borrowers that had a balance only paid the minimum amount of interest due. ﻿ For more information on the Company’s credit quality indicators relating to its bank loans, see Item 8 – Note 6. ﻿ The Company has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios, which include U.S. agency, and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. state and municipal securities, and commercial paper. ﻿ At December 31, 2016, substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade. U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. ﻿ The Company has exposure to concentration risk when holding large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or within a particular industry or geographical area. ﻿ The fair value of the Company’s investments in mortgage-backed securities totaled $105.9 billion at December 31, 2016. Of these, $104.9 billion were issued by U.S. agencies and $1.0 billion were issued by private entities (non-agency securities). ﻿ The fair value of the Company’s investments in asset-backed securities totaled $21.3 billion at December 31, 2016. Schwab holds $10.1 billion floating rate Federal Family Education Loan Program Asset-Backed Securities (FFELP ABS). Beginning in 2015, two Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations began placing a portion of FFELP ABS on review for downgrade. At December 31, 2016, five securities with an aggregate fair value of $1.2 billion were below investment grade. Both agencies have indicated that additional classes could be downgraded below investment grade due to the risk that some remainder of the securities could be outstanding after their legal final maturity dates. The timing of FFELP ABS principal payment is inherently uncertain given the variety of payment options available to student loan borrowers. Loans collateralizing these securities continue to be covered by a guarantee from the Department of Education of at least 97% of principal and interest. The Company holds only senior class notes that have additional credit enhancement of 3% or more - 40 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) that, together with the Department of Education guarantee, provide 100% or more credit enhancement. The Company has an independent credit assessment function and does not consider these securities to be impaired because it expects full payment of principal and interest. Therefore, the Company continues to assign them the highest internal credit rating. ﻿ The fair value of the Company’s investments in corporate debt securities and commercial paper totaled $10.6 billion at December 31, 2016, with 48% issued by institutions in the financial services industry. These securities are included in AFS securities, cash and cash equivalents, and other securities owned in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Issuer, geographic, and sector concentrations are controlled by established credit policy limits to each concentration type. ﻿ Foreign Holdings ﻿ At December 31, 2016, the Company had exposure to non-sovereign financial and non-financial institutions in foreign countries of $6.8 billion, with the fair value of the top three exposures being to issuers and counterparties domiciled in France at $1.9 billion, Sweden at $1.3 billion and Australia at $1.0 billion. The Company has no direct exposure to sovereign foreign governments. The Company does not have unfunded commitments to counterparties in foreign countries, nor does it have exposure as a result of credit default protection purchased or sold separately as of December 31, 2016. ﻿ In addition to the direct holdings in foreign companies, the Company has indirect exposure to foreign countries through its investments in CSIM money market funds (collectively, the Funds) resulting from brokerage clearing activities. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $108 million in investments in these Funds. Certain of the Funds’ positions include certificates of deposits, time deposits, commercial paper and corporate debt securities issued by counterparties in foreign countries. Additionally, at December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding margin loans to foreign residents of $366 million, which are fully collateralized. ﻿ Market Risk ﻿ Market risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by the Company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, or market conditions. ﻿ The Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on its interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources that finance these assets. The majority of the Company’s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. A portion of the Company’s investment portfolios is sensitive to changes in long-term interest rates. ﻿ Net interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may reprice at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short and long-term interest rates. Interest-earning assets primarily include investment securities, margin loans and bank loans. These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment. Because the Company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin loans and bank loans, and controls the composition of its investment securities, it has some ability to manage its net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions. ﻿ To mitigate the risk of declining interest revenue, the Company has established policies and procedures, which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk, and monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interest-earning assets and funding sources. To remain within these guidelines, the Company manages the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios. ﻿ Financial instruments held by the Company are also subject to the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument. The Company is indirectly exposed to option, futures, and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option and futures accounts, securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers, and client securities loaned out as part of the Company’s brokerage securities lending activities. Equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity, margin borrowing, and overall client - 41 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) engagement with the Company. Additionally, the Company earns mutual fund and ETF service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets. Fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue earned by the Company. ﻿ The Company’s market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material. ﻿ Net Interest Revenue Simulation ﻿ For the Company’s net interest revenue sensitivity analysis, the Company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulation includes all interest-sensitive assets and liabilities. Key variables in the simulation include the repricing of financial instruments, prepayment, reinvestment, and product pricing assumptions. The Company uses constant balances and market rates in the simulation assumptions in order to minimize the number of variables and to better isolate risks. The simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies, including changes in asset and liability mix. ﻿ If the Company’s guidelines for its net interest revenue sensitivity are breached, management must report the breach to the Company’s Corporate Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee and establish a plan to address the interest rate risk. There were no breaches of the Company’s net interest revenue sensitivity guidelines during the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015. ﻿ As represented by the simulations presented below, the Company’s investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall. ﻿ The simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As the Company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood the Company would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment. The following table shows the simulated net interest revenue change over the next 12 months beginning December 31, 2016 and 2015 of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period. ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ December 31, 2016 2015 Increase of 100 basis points 6.5 % 8.2 % Decrease of 100 basis points (9.8) % (9.5) % ﻿ The change in net interest revenue sensitivities as of December 31, 2016 reflects the increase in interest rates across all terms. The low client deposit rates under current Federal fund levels limits the extent to which the Company can reduce interest expense paid on funding sources. A decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the Company’s investment and loan portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense, further compressing net interest margin. The increase of short-term interest rates positively impacts net interest revenue as yields on interest-earning assets rise faster than the cost of funding sources. ﻿ Liquidity Risk ﻿ Liquidity risk is the potential that the Company will be unable to sell assets or meet cash flow obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses. ﻿ Due to its role as a source of financial strength, CSC’s liquidity needs are primarily driven by the liquidity and capital needs of the brokerage subsidiaries, the capital needs of Schwab Bank, the amount of dividend payments on CSC’s common and preferred stock and principal and interest due on corporate debt. The liquidity needs of its brokerage subsidiaries are - 42 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) primarily driven by client activity including trading and margin borrowing activities and capital expenditures, and the capital needs of its bank subsidiary are primarily driven by client deposits. ﻿ The Company has established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of its business strategies, while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet its operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stress conditions. The Company seeks to maintain client confidence in its balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the Company to meet its obligations. To this end, the Company has established limits and contingency funding scenarios to support liquidity levels during both expected and stressed scenarios. ﻿ The Company employs a variety of methodologies to monitor and manage liquidity. The Company conducts regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure the Company’s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific liquidity stress events. Liquidity is also tested at key subsidiaries and results are reported on a monthly basis to the Company’s Corporate Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the Company and are reviewed with management as appropriate. ﻿ Beginning on January 1, 2016, the Company became subject to the modified LCR rule, which was fully phased in on January 1, 2017 and requires CSC to hold HQLAs equal to at least 70% of projected net cash outflows over a 30-day period, as defined by the rule. At December 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with the fully phased-in modified LCR rule. ﻿ Primary Funding Sources ﻿ The Company’s primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity: bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts. In 2016, bank deposits swept from brokerage accounts increased $33.0 billion. These funds were used to purchase investment securities, thereby funding a significant portion of the 22% growth in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. ﻿ Other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, repayments on loans, securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts, and cash provided by external financing or equity offerings. ﻿ To meet daily funding needs, the Company maintains liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments. For unanticipated liquidity needs, the Company maintains a buffer of highly liquid investments, currently comprised of U.S. Treasury notes. ﻿ Additional Funding Sources ﻿ In addition to internal sources of liquidity, the Company has sources of external funding. CSC maintains a $750 million committed, unsecured credit facility with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in June 2017. Other than an overnight borrowing to test the availability of this facility, it was unused during 2016. The funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes. The financial covenants require Schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, Schwab Bank to be well capitalized, and CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity, adjusted to exclude AOCI. At December 31, 2016, the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was $10.2 billion (CSC’s stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, at December 31, 2016 was $16.6 billion). Management believes these restrictions will not have a material effect on CSC’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements. ﻿ CSC and Schwab also have access to uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines with several banks. The need for short-term borrowings from these sources arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest-earning investments, and movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements. These lines were not used by CSC during 2016. Schwab used such borrowings for one day in 2016, for $15 million and there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2016. ﻿ - 43 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) To partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation, the broker-dealer subsidiaries have unsecured standby letter of credit agreements (LOCs) with several banks in favor of the Options Clearing Corporation aggregating $295 million at December 31, 2016. There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs during 2016 or 2015. In connection with its securities lending activities, the Company is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. The collateral requirements were satisfied by providing cash as collateral. ﻿ Schwab Bank has access to short-term secured funding through the Federal Reserve’s discount window. Amounts available under the Federal Reserve discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain of Schwab Bank’s investment securities that are pledged as collateral. Schwab Bank maintains policies and procedures necessary to access this funding and tests discount window borrowing procedures on a periodic basis. At December 31, 2016, $849 million was available under this arrangement. Schwab Bank used such borrowings for one day during 2016 for $1 million and there were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2016. ﻿ Schwab Bank also maintains a secured credit facility with the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB). Amounts available under this facility are dependent on the amount of Schwab Bank’s First Mortgages, HELOCs, and the fair value of certain of Schwab Bank’s investment securities that are pledged as collateral. Schwab Bank maintains policies and procedures necessary to access this funding and tests borrowing procedures on a periodic basis. During 2016, Schwab Bank used borrowings under this agreement to purchase investment securities prior to bulk transfers. As the bulk transfers were completed, the proceeds were used to pay down advances. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2016 with $16.5 billion available based on the loans and securities currently pledged. This credit facility is also available as backup financing in the event of unexpected client cash outflow from Schwab Bank’s balance sheet. ﻿ CSC has authorization from its Board of Directors to issue unsecured commercial paper notes (Commercial Paper Notes) not to exceed $1.5 billion. Management has set a current limit for the commercial paper program not to exceed the amount of the committed, unsecured credit facility, which was $750 million at December 31, 2016. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes may vary, but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper is not redeemable prior to maturity and cannot be voluntarily prepaid. The proceeds of the commercial paper program are to be used for general corporate purposes. CSC’s ratings for these short-term borrowings are P1 by Moody’s, A1 by Standard & Poor’s, and F1 by Fitch. CSC had no Commercial Paper Notes outstanding at December 31, 2016 or 2015. ﻿ CSC had long-term debt of $2.9 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 bearing a weighted-average interest rate of 3.37%. CSC has a universal automatic shelf registration statement (Shelf Registration Statement) on file with the SEC, which enables it to issue debt, equity, and other securities. ﻿ On March 10, 2015, CSC issued $625 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes that mature in 2018 and $375 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes that mature in 2025. The Senior Notes due 2018 and 2025 have a fixed interest rate of 1.50% and 3.00%, respectively, with interest payable semi-annually. Additionally, on November 13, 2015, CSC issued $350 million aggregate amount of 3.450% Senior Notes that mature in 2026, with interest payable semi-annually. ﻿ The following are details of CSC’s Senior and Medium-Term Notes: ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ Par Weighted Average Standard December 31, 2016 Outstanding Maturity Interest Rate Moody’s & Poor’s Fitch Senior Notes $ 2,581 2018 - 2026 3.03% fixed A2 A A Medium-Term Notes $ 250 2017 6.375% fixed A2 A A ﻿ ﻿ On October 31, 2016, the Company issued and sold 600,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th ownership interest in a share of fixed-to-floating rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (Series E Preferred Stock), $0.01 par value, with a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share (equivalent to $1,000 per depositary share). The Series E Preferred Stock has a fixed dividend rate of 4.625% through February 28, 2022, payable semi-annually, and thereafter at a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread of 3.315%, payable quarterly. Net proceeds received from the sale were $591 million. ﻿ - 44 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) On March 7, 2016, CSC completed an equity offering of 30 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of 5.95% non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (Series D Preferred Stock). The net proceeds from the sale were $725 million. ﻿ On August 3, 2015, CSC completed an equity offering of 24 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of 6.00% non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (Series C Preferred Stock). The net proceeds from the sale were $581 million. CSC’s preferred stock is rated Baa2 by Moody’s, BBB by Standard & Poor’s and BB+ by Fitch. ﻿ For further discussion of CSC’s long-term debt and information on the equity offerings, see Item 8 – Note 13 and Note 17. ﻿ Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements ﻿ The Company enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of its clients. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, the Company enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements in the ordinary course of business. For information on each of these arrangements, see Item 8 – Note 6, Note 10, Note 13, Note 14, and Note 15. ﻿ Contractual Obligations ﻿ The Company’s principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 are shown in the following table. Management believes that funds generated by its continuing operations, as well as cash provided by external financing, will continue to be the primary funding sources in meeting these obligations. Excluded from this table are liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet that are generally short-term in nature (e.g., payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations) or without contractual payment terms (e.g., bank deposits, payables to brokerage clients, and deferred compensation). ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ Less than 1-3 3-5 More than December 31, 2016 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Total Credit-related financial instruments (1) $ 1,047 $ 2,543 $ 3,597 $ 1,904 $ 9,091 Long-term debt (2) 344 1,036 795 1,084 3,259 Leases (3) 110 165 103 282 660 Purchase obligations (4) 211 132 41 200 584 Total $ 1,712 $ 3,876 $ 4,536 $ 3,470 $ 13,594 ﻿ (1) Represents Schwab Bank’s commitments to extend credit to banking clients and purchase mortgage loans. (2) Includes estimated future interest payments through 2017 for Medium-Term Notes and through 2026 for Senior Notes. Amounts exclude maturities under a finance lease obligation and unamortized discounts and premiums. (3) Represents minimum rental commitments, net of sublease commitments, and includes facilities under the Company’s past restructuring initiatives and rental commitments under a finance lease obligation. (4) Consists of purchase obligations for services such as advertising and marketing, telecommunications, professional services, and hardware- and software-related agreements. Includes purchase obligations that can be canceled by the Company without penalty. ﻿ CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ﻿ The Company seeks to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support execution of its business strategy, including anticipated balance sheet growth, providing financial support to its subsidiaries, and sustained access to the capital markets, while at the same time meeting its regulatory capital requirements and serving as a source of financial strength to Schwab Bank. The Company’s primary sources of capital are funds generated by the operations of its subsidiaries and securities issuances by CSC in the capital markets. To ensure that it has a sufficient amount of capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values, the Company has adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios. ﻿ Internal guidelines are set, for both the Company and its regulated subsidiaries, to ensure capital levels are in line with the Company’s strategy and regulatory requirements, and capital forecasts are reviewed monthly at Capital Planning and Asset- - 45 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Liability Management and Pricing Committee meetings. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify potential problems that could impact capital. In addition, the Company monitors its subsidiaries’ capital levels and requirements. Subject to regulatory capital requirements and any required approvals, any excess capital held by subsidiaries is transferred to CSC in the form of dividends and returns of capital. When subsidiaries have need of additional capital, funds are provided by CSC as equity investments and also as subordinated loans (in a form approved as regulatory capital by regulators) for Schwab. The details and method used for each cash infusion are based on an analysis of the particular entity’s needs and financing alternatives. The amounts and structure of infusions must take into consideration maintenance of regulatory capital requirements, debt/equity ratios, and equity double leverage ratios. ﻿ The Company conducts regular capital stress testing to assess the potential financial impacts of various adverse macroeconomic and company-specific events to which the Company could be subjected. The objective of the Company’s capital stress testing is (1) to explore various potential outcomes – including rare and extreme events and (2) to assess impacts of potential stressful outcomes on both capital and liquidity. Additionally, the Company has a comprehensive Capital Contingency Plan to provide action plans for certain low probability/high impact capital events that the Company might face. The Capital Contingency Plan is issued under the authority of the Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee and provides guidelines for sustained capital events. It does not specifically address every contingency, but is designed to provide a framework for responding to any capital stress. The results of the stress testing indicate there are two scenarios which could stress the Company’s capital: (1) inflows of balance sheet cash during a period of very low interest rates and (2) outflows of balance sheet cash when other sources of financing are not available and the Company is required to sell assets to fund the flows at a loss. The Capital Contingency Plan is reviewed annually and updated as appropriate. ﻿ For additional information, see Business – Regulation in Part I, Item 1. ﻿ Regulatory Capital Requirements ﻿ CSC is subject to capital requirements set by the Federal Reserve and is required to serve as a source of strength for Schwab Bank and to provide financial assistance if Schwab Bank experiences financial distress. The Company is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for CSC of at least 4%; however, management seeks to maintain the ratio of at least 6%. Due to the relatively low risk of the Company’s balance sheet assets and risk-based capital ratios at CSC and Schwab Bank that are well in excess of regulatory requirements, the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint on CSC’s asset growth. ﻿ Schwab Bank is subject to capital requirements set by the OCC that are substantially similar to those imposed on CSC by the Federal Reserve. Schwab Bank’s failure to remain well capitalized could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that could have a direct material effect on the bank. The Company is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for Schwab Bank of at least 5% to be well capitalized, but seeks to maintain the ratio of at least 6.25%. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2016, Schwab Bank is considered well capitalized. ﻿ See Item 8 – Note 22 for a summary of both CSC and Schwab Bank’s capital ratios. ﻿ - 46 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The following table details CSC’s and Schwab Bank’s capital ratios: ﻿ ﻿ December 31, 2016 CSC Schwab Bank Total stockholders’ equity $ 16,421 $ 11,726 Less: Preferred Stock 2,783 - Common Equity Tier 1 Capital before regulatory adjustments $ 13,638 $ 11,726 Less: Goodwill, net of associated deferred tax liabilities $ 1,175 $ 11 Other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities 52 - AOCI adjustment (1) (163) (163) Common Equity Tier 1 Capital $ 12,574 $ 11,878 Tier 1 Capital $ 15,357 $ 11,878 Total Capital 15,384 11,904 Risk-Weighted Assets 68,179 59,915 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital/Risk-Weighted Assets 18.4 % 19.8 % Tier 1 Capital/Risk-Weighted Assets 22.5 % 19.8 % Total Capital/Risk-Weighted Assets 22.6 % 19.9 % Tier 1 Leverage Ratio 7.2 % 7.0 % ﻿ ﻿ (1) CSC and Schwab Bank have elected to opt-out of the requirement to include most components of AOCI in CET1 Capital. ﻿ Schwab Bank is also subject to regulatory requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions. In addition, Schwab Bank is required to provide notice to, and may be required to obtain approval from, the OCC and the Federal Reserve to declare dividends to CSC. ﻿ The Company’s broker-dealer subsidiaries (Schwab and optionsXpress) are subject to regulatory requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule. The rule is intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit the broker-dealer subsidiaries from paying cash dividends, making unsecured advances and loans to their parent company and employees, and repaying subordinated borrowings from CSC if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000. As such, the broker-dealer subsidiaries are required to maintain, at all times, at least the minimum level of net capital required under Rule 15c3-1. At December 31, 2016, Schwab and optionsXpress met and exceeded their net capital requirements. ﻿ In addition to the capital requirements above, the Company’s subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure financial soundness and liquidity. See Item 8 – Note 22 for additional information on the components of stockholders’ equity and information on the capital requirements of each of the subsidiaries. ﻿ Dividends ﻿ Since the initial dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 111 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend rate 20 times, resulting in a 20% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, CSC currently targets its common stock cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income. ﻿ On April 21, 2016 the Board of Directors of the Company declared a one cent, or 17%, increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.07 per common share. On January 26, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a one cent, or 14%, increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.08 per common share. - 47 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The following table details the CSC cash dividends paid and per share amounts: ﻿ ﻿ Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 ﻿ Per Share Per Share ﻿ Cash Paid Amount Cash Paid Amount Common Stock $ 360 $ 0.27 $ 318 $ 0.24 Series A Preferred Stock (1) 28 70.00 28 70.00 Series B Preferred Stock (2) 29 60.00 29 60.00 Series C Preferred Stock (2) 36 60.00 12 19.67 Series D Preferred Stock (2,3) 33 43.65 - - Series E Preferred Stock (4) - - - - ﻿ ﻿ (1) Dividends paid semi-annually until February 1, 2022 and quarterly thereafter. (2) Dividends paid quarterly. (3) Series D Preferred Stock was issued on March 7, 2016. (4) Series E Preferred Stock was issued on October 31, 2016. Dividends paid semi-annually until March 1, 2022 and quarterly thereafter. ﻿ Share Repurchases ﻿ There were no repurchases of CSC’s common stock in 2016 or 2015. As of December 31, 2016, CSC had remaining authority from the Board of Directors to repurchase up to $596 million of its common stock, which is not subject to expiration. ﻿ FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ﻿ The Company uses the market approach to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, and to determine fair value disclosures. See Item 8 – Note 2 and Note 16 for more information on the Company’s assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. ﻿ When available, the Company uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. When utilizing market data and bid-ask spread, the Company uses the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices do not exist, the Company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets. The Company generally obtains prices from at least three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value. The Company’s primary independent pricing service provides prices based on observable trades and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar “to-be-issued” securities. The Company compares the prices obtained from its primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. The Company does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in a material difference in the recorded amounts. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not adjust prices received from the primary independent third-party pricing service. ﻿ CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ﻿ The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. While the majority of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position and reported financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below. Management regularly - 48 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy. ﻿ Other-than-Temporary Impairment of Investment Securities ﻿ The Company internally conducts pre-purchase analyses and ongoing, post-purchase monitoring of investments that it owns. The Company assigns a risk rating to each issuer of the securities in the Company’s investment securities portfolio based on these analyses. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors credit indicators related to its securities portfolio and adjusts the internal ratings accordingly. ﻿ Management evaluates whether investment securities are OTTI on a quarterly basis. Debt securities with unrealized losses are considered OTTI if the Company intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such security before any anticipated recovery. If management determines that a security is OTTI under these circumstances, the impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the entire difference between the amortized cost and the then-current fair value. ﻿ A security is also OTTI if management does not expect to recover the amortized cost of the security. In this circumstance, the impairment recognized in earnings represents the estimated credit loss, and is measured by the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost of the security. Management utilizes cash flow models to estimate the expected future cash flow from the securities and to estimate the credit loss. Expected cash flows are discounted using the security’s effective interest rate. ﻿ The evaluation of whether the Company expects to recover the amortized cost of a security is inherently judgmental. The evaluation includes the consideration of multiple factors including: the magnitude and duration of the unrealized loss; the financial condition of the issuer; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings; internal credit ratings; for asset-backed securities, the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security to absorb credit losses on the underlying collateral; recent events specific to the issuer and the issuer’s industry; and whether the Company has received all scheduled principal and interest payments. ﻿ Valuation of Goodwill ﻿ The Company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually, or whenever indications of impairment exist. Impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, resulting in an impairment charge for this excess. Adverse changes in the Company’s planned business operations such as unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit, or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the Company’s recorded goodwill. ﻿ The Company can elect to qualitatively assess goodwill for impairment if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. A qualitative assessment considers macroeconomic and other industry-specific factors, such as trends in short-term and long-term interest rates and the ability to access capital, and Company specific factors such as market capitalization in excess of net assets, trends in revenue generating activities, and merger or acquisition activity. If the Company elects to bypass qualitatively assessing goodwill, or it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, management estimates the fair values of each of the Company’s reporting units (defined as the Company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) and compares it to their carrying values. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are established using an income approach based on a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit, a market approach which compares each reporting unit to comparable companies in their respective industries, as well as a market capitalization analysis. ﻿ The Company’s annual goodwill impairment testing date is April 1st. In 2016, the Company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment. As of April 1, 2016, the Company determined through quantitative testing that the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value of each of the Company’s reporting units, and concluded that goodwill was not impaired. ﻿ - 49 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Allowance for Loan Losses ﻿ The appropriateness of the allowance is reviewed quarterly by management, taking into consideration current economic conditions, the existing loan portfolio composition, past loss experience, and risks inherent in the portfolios. ﻿ The methodology to establish an allowance for loan losses related to the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios utilizes statistical models that estimate prepayments, defaults, and probable losses for the loan types based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the types. The methodology considers the effects of borrower behavior and a variety of factors including, but not limited to, interest rates, housing price movements as measured by a housing price index, economic conditions, estimated defaults and foreclosures measured by historical and expected delinquencies, changes in prepayment speeds, LTV ratios, past loss experience, estimates of future loss severities, borrower credit risk, and the adequacy of collateral. The methodology also evaluates concentrations in the loan types, including loan products within those types, year of origination, and geographical distribution of collateral. ﻿ Probable losses are forecast using a loan-level simulation of the delinquency status of the loans over the term of the loans. The simulation starts with the current relevant risk indicators, including the current delinquent status of each loan, the estimated current LTV ratio of each loan, the term and structure of each loan, current key interest rates including U.S. Treasury and LIBOR rates, and borrower FICO scores. The more significant variables in the simulation include delinquency roll rates, loss severity, housing prices, and interest rates. Delinquency roll rates are estimated from the Company’s historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information. Loss severity estimates are based on the Company’s historical loss experience and market trends. The estimated loss severity (i.e., loss given default) used in the allowance for loan loss for HELOCs is higher than that used for First Mortgages. Housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values. Factors affecting the home price index include housing inventory, unemployment, interest rates, and inflation expectations. Interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths. This methodology results in loss factors that are applied to the outstanding balances to determine the allowance for loan loss for each loan type. ﻿ Legal and Regulatory Reserves ﻿ Reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, insurance coverage and indemnification, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved. ﻿ The Company’s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee. Additionally, management has reviewed with the Audit Committee the Company’s significant estimates discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. ﻿ See Item 8 – Note 2 for more information on critical accounting estimates. ﻿ ﻿ - 50 - THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION ﻿ ﻿ ﻿Item 7A.

316709,SCHW,SCHWAB CHARLES CORP,2018,"Item 7.Developments in the business, economic, and geopolitical environment could negatively impact our business.Our business can be adversely affected by the general environment – economic, corporate, securities market, regulatory, and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations, trading activity, interest rates, and overall investor engagement, and are outside of our control. Deterioration in the housing and credit markets, reduction in short-term interest rates, and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact our results of operations and capital resources.Extensive regulation of our businesses may subject us to significant penalties or limitations on business activities.As a participant in the securities, banking, and financial services industries, we are subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws by governmental agencies, supervisory authorities and SROs. The costs and uncertainty related to complying with such regulations continue to increase. These regulations affect our business operations and impose capital, client protection, and market conduct requirements on us.In addition to specific banking laws and regulations, our banking regulators have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies and could require CSC and/or our banking subsidiaries to hold more capital, increase liquidity, or limit their ability to pay dividends or CSC’s ability to repurchase or redeem shares. The banking regulators could also limit our ability to grow, including adding assets, launching new products, making acquisitions, and undertaking strategic investments, could limit our banking subsidiaries’ ability to accept deposits swept from client brokerage accounts and brokered deposits and could prevent us from pursuing our business strategy.Despite our efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements, there are a number of risks, particularly in areas where applicable laws or regulations may be unclear or where regulators could revise their previous guidance. Any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by our regulators against us or our affiliates, officers or employees could result in fines, penalties, cease and desist orders, enforcement actions, suspension, disqualification or expulsion, or other disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on our business activities, any of which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.While we maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, violations could occur. In addition, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time. There may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance, including restrictions on certain activities. Such a finding may also damage our reputation and our relationships with our regulators and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities.- 9 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONLegislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively affect our business and financial results.New legislation, rules, regulations and guidance, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal, state, foreign and SRO rules, regulations and guidance, including changes relating to mutual funds, broker-dealer fiduciary duties and regulatory treatment of deposit accounts, may directly affect the operation and profitability of Schwab or its specific business lines. Our profitability could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes to the laws governing taxation, electronic commerce, client privacy and security of client data. In addition, the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business we conduct, modifications to our business practices, more stringent capital and liquidity requirements, increased deposit insurance assessments or additional costs. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to our compliance, risk management, treasury and operations functions.Failure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect our financial condition.CSC, together with its banking and broker-dealer subsidiaries, must meet certain capital and liquidity standards, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about the adequacy of Schwab’s capital and Schwab’s internal assessment of its capital needs. The Uniform Net Capital Rule limits CS&Co’s ability to transfer capital to CSC and other affiliates. New regulatory capital, liquidity, and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including paying dividends, stock repurchases, and redemptions, and may require us to increase our capital and/or liquidity or to limit our growth. Failure by either CSC or its banking subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a negative impact on us. In addition, failure by CSC or our banking subsidiaries to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to satisfy their capital conservation buffer requirements (as phased in) would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital, replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as Tier 1 capital, or increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity, could require us to liquidate assets, deleverage or otherwise change our business and/or investment plans, which may adversely affect our financial results. Issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders.With $243.3 billion in consolidated total assets at December 31, 2017, we are currently only subject to the “standardized approach” capital framework of Basel III and modified liquidity requirements. When our consolidated total assets equal or exceed $250 billion, we will become subject to the “advanced approaches” framework, including being subject to a supplementary leverage ratio, the inclusion of AOCI in regulatory capital, the unmodified LCR, enhanced Basel III disclosures, and a more complex calculation of risk weighted assets that includes an assessment of the impact of operational risk. In addition, federal banking agencies have broad discretion and could require CSC or its banking subsidiaries to hold higher levels of capital or increase liquidity above the applicable regulatory requirements.Significant interest rate changes could affect our profitability.The direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings. A decline in interest rates may have a negative impact on our net interest revenue. A low interest rate environment may also have a negative impact on our asset management and administration fee revenues if we have to waive a portion of our management fees for certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds in order to continue providing a positive return to clients.Overall, we are positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment. A rise in interest rates may cause our funding costs to increase if market conditions or the competitive environment forces us to raise our interest rates to avoid losing deposits. Higher funding costs without offsetting increases in yields on interest-earning assets can reduce our net interest revenue.The manner in which interest rates are calculated could also impact our net interest revenue. For example, certain securities in Schwab’s investment portfolios have floating interest rates based on benchmarks like the one-month LIBOR, which has been the subject of recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms may cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past, or be replaced as a benchmark, and could result in lower interest payments and a reduction in the value of the securities.- 10 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONA significant change in client cash allocations could negatively impact our net interest revenue.We rely heavily on bank deposits as a low cost source of funding to extend loans to clients and purchase investment securities. Our bank deposits are primarily driven by our bank sweep feature: uninvested cash balances in our client brokerage accounts are swept to our banking subsidiaries. A significant reduction in our clients’ allocation to cash, a change in the allocation of that cash, or a transfer of cash away from the Company, could reduce net interest revenue. Security breaches of our systems, or those of our clients or third parties, may subject us to significant liability and damage Schwab’s reputation.Our business involves the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential information about our clients and us. Information security risks for financial institutions are increasing, in part because of the use of the internet and mobile technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, activists, hackers and other external parties, including foreign state actors. Our systems and those of other financial institutions have been and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, for example, employee misconduct.Given the high volume of transactions that we process, the large number of clients, counterparties and third-party service providers with which we do business and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks, a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected. The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before an investigation is completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known. During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.Security breaches, including breaches of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers or clients, could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject us to significant liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance, actions by our regulators, damage to Schwab’s reputation, or a loss of confidence in our security measures which could harm our business. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures.We also face risk related to external fraud involving the misappropriation and use of clients’ user names, passwords or other personal information to gain access to clients’ financial accounts at Schwab. This could occur from the compromise of clients’ personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company where clients’ personal information is taken and then made available to fraudsters. Such risk has grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties, including foreign state-sponsored parties. Losses reimbursed to clients under our guarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Technology and operational failures or errors could subject us to losses, litigation, regulatory actions, and reputational damage.We must process, record and monitor a large number of transactions and our operations are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology systems and our ability to make timely enhancements and additions to our systems. System interruptions, errors or downtime can result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to our systems, linkages with third-party systems and power failures and can have a significant impact on our business and operations. Our systems are vulnerable to disruptions from human error, execution errors, errors in models such as those used for asset management, capital planning and management, risk management, stress testing and compliance, employee misconduct, unauthorized trading, external fraud, computer viruses, distributed denial of service attacks, cyber attacks, terrorist attacks, natural disaster, power outage, capacity constraints, software flaws, events impacting key business partners and vendors, and similar events. For example, Schwab and other financial institutions have been the - 11 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONtarget of various denial of service attacks that have, in certain circumstances, made websites, mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time. It could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to our technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen occurrence, which could affect our ability to process and settle client transactions. Moreover, instances of fraud or other misconduct might also negatively impact Schwab’s reputation and client confidence in the Company, in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk, oversee operational areas involving risk, and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer unexpected losses, reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors, including those of our vendors or other third parties.While we devote substantial attention and resources to the reliability, capacity and scalability of our systems, extraordinary trading volumes could cause our computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail, affecting our ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients’ orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate. Disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses and decreased client satisfaction. We are also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges, clearing houses and other intermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement. System failures and constraints and transaction errors at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices, cause substantial losses for us and for our clients, and subject us to claims from our clients for damages. A significant decrease in our liquidity could negatively affect our business and financial management as well as reduce client confidence in Schwab.Maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to our business operations, including margin lending, mortgage lending, and transaction settlement, among other liquidity needs. We meet our liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by client activity and operating earnings, as well as cash provided by external financing. Fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances, as well as changes in regulatory treatment of client deposits or market conditions, may affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs. A reduction in our liquidity position could reduce client confidence in Schwab, which could result in the loss of client accounts, or could cause us to fail to satisfy our liquidity requirements, including the modified LCR. In addition, if our broker-dealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines, regulators could limit the subsidiaries’ operations or their ability to upstream funds to CSC, which could reduce CSC’s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt and pay cash dividends. In addition, CSC may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries.Factors which may adversely affect our liquidity position include CS&Co having temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances, unanticipated outflows of company cash, fluctuations in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts, a dramatic increase in our client lending activities (including margin, mortgage-related, and personal lending), increased capital requirements, changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations, other regulatory changes, or a loss of market or client confidence in Schwab.When cash generated by client activity and operating earnings is not sufficient for our liquidity needs, we may seek external financing. During periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets, potential sources of external financing could be reduced, and borrowing costs could increase. Although CSC and CS&Co maintain committed and uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines and CSC has a commercial paper issuance program, as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC which can be used to sell securities, financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets. In addition, a significant downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets.We may suffer significant losses from our credit exposures.Our businesses are subject to the risk that a client, counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations, or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate. While we have policies and procedures designed to manage this risk, the policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Our exposure mainly results from margin lending, clients’ options trading, futures activities, securities lending, mortgage lending, pledged asset lending, our role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities, and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds we sponsor.When clients purchase securities on margin, borrow on lines of credit collateralized by securities, or trade options or futures, we are subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their - 12 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONaccounts falls below the amount of clients’ indebtedness. Abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses.We have exposure to credit risk associated with our investments. Those investments are subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the financial market’s assessment of credit quality. Loss of value of securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such securities are other than temporarily impaired. The evaluation of whether other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) exists is a matter of judgment, which includes the assessment of several factors. If management determines that a security is OTTI, the cost basis of the security may be adjusted and a corresponding loss may be recognized in current earnings. Deterioration in the performance of available for sale (AFS) and held to maturity (HTM) securities could result in the recognition of future impairment charges. Even if a security is not considered OTTI, if we were ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity needs, we would have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time. Our bank loans primarily consist of First Mortgages, HELOCs, and PALs. Increases in delinquency and default rates, housing and stock price declines, increases in the unemployment rate, and other economic factors can result in charges for loan loss reserves and write downs on such loans.Heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments can increase our risk of loss. Examples include:•Large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry;•Mortgage loans and HELOCs to banking clients which are secured by properties in the same geographic region; and•Client margins, options or futures, pledged assets, and securities lending activities collateralized by or linked to securities of a single issuer, index, or industry.We sponsor a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds. Although we have no obligation to do so, we may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit, liquidity or other support to our funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity. Such support could cause us to take significant charges, could reduce our liquidity and, in certain situations, could, with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds, result in us having to consolidate a supported fund in our financial statements. If we chose not to provide credit, liquidity or other support in such a situation, Schwab could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected.We are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending against claims or proceedings.The financial services industry faces significant litigation and regulatory risks. We are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages. We are also the subject of inquiries, investigations, and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies.Litigation and arbitration claims include those brought by our clients and the clients of third party advisors whose assets are custodied at Schwab. Claims from clients of third party advisors may allege losses due to investment decisions made by the third party advisors or the advisors’ misconduct. Litigation claims also include claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights (e.g., patents). Such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources. If we were found to have infringed on a third-party patent, or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial damages, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology, or providing certain products or services.Actions brought against us may result in settlements, awards, injunctions, fines, penalties or other results adverse to us, including reputational harm. Even if we are successful in defending against these actions, the defense of such matters may result in us incurring significant expenses. A substantial judgment, settlement, fine, or penalty could be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular future period, depending on our results for that period. In market downturns, the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased. - 13 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONWe rely on outsourced service providers to perform key functions.We rely on external service providers to perform certain key technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. These service providers face technology, operating, business, and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee, or company information, could cause us to incur losses and could harm Schwab’s reputation. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider as a result of systems failures, capacity constraints, financial difficulties or for any other reason, and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services, and result in financial losses to us. Switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations. Potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on our financial position.We evaluate potential strategic transactions, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions. Any such transaction could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The process of evaluating, negotiating, and effecting any such strategic transaction may divert management’s attention from other business concerns, and might cause the loss of key clients, employees, and business partners. Moreover, integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties, including the need to integrate operational, financial, and management information systems and management controls, integrate relationships with clients and business partners, and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas. In addition, an acquisition may cause us to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings. Further, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition, and any future acquisition could be dilutive to our current stockholders’ percentage ownership or to earnings per common share (EPS).Our acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in the business, operations or financial condition of the entity being acquired or sold. To the extent we enter into an agreement to buy or sell an entity, there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected, or at all. If a material transaction does not close, our stock price could decline.Our industry is characterized by aggressive price competition.We continually monitor our pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjust trade commission rates, interest rates on deposits and loans, fees for advisory services, expense ratios on mutual funds and ETFs, and other pricing to enhance our competitive position. Increased price competition from other financial services firms, such as reduced commissions to attract trading volume, higher deposit rates to attract client cash balances or reduced expense ratios to attract mutual fund or ETF investments, could impact our results of operations and financial condition.We face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees.The market for qualified personnel in our business is highly competitive. At various times, different functions and roles are in especially high demand in the market, compelling us to pay more to attract talent. Our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs.Our stock price has fluctuated historically, and may continue to fluctuate.Our stock price can be volatile. Among the factors that may affect the volatility of our stock price are the following:•Our exposure to changes in interest rates;•Speculation in the investment community or the press about, or actual changes in, our competitive position, organizational structure, executive team, operations, financial condition, financial reporting and results, expense discipline, or strategic transactions;•The announcement of new products, services, acquisitions, or dispositions by us or our competitors; and•Increases or decreases in revenue or earnings, changes in earnings estimates by the investment community, and variations between estimated financial results and actual financial results.- 14 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONChanges in the stock market generally, or as it concerns our industry, as well as geopolitical, corporate, regulatory, business, and economic factors may also affect our stock price.Future sales of CSC’s equity securities may adversely affect the market price of CSC’s common stock and result in dilution.CSC’s certificate of incorporation authorizes CSC’s Board of Directors, among other things, to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities, without stockholder approval.CSC may issue additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital or for other purposes. The issuance of any additional equity or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of CSC’s common stock and may adversely affect the market price of CSC’s common stock.Item 1B.

We believe that metrics relating to net new and total client assets, as well as client cash levels and utilization of advisory services, offer perspective on our business momentum and client engagement. Data on new and total client brokerage accounts provides additional perspective on our ability to attract and retain new business. Total net revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin, EPS, and return on average common stockholders’ equity provide broad indicators of Schwab’s overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns. Total expenses, excluding interest, as a percentage of average client assets, is a measure of operating efficiency. Finally, management believes the Consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint currently imposed by regulators. Results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 are: Growth Rate1-Year2016-2017 2017 2016 2015Client Metrics: Net new client assets (in billions)86% $233.1 $125.5 $139.4Core net new client assets (in billions) (1)58% $198.6 $125.5 $134.7Client assets (in billions, at year end)21% $3,361.8 $2,779.5 $2,513.8Average client assets (in billions)17% $3,060.2 $2,614.7 $2,531.8New brokerage accounts (in thousands)32% 1,441 1,093 1,070Active brokerage accounts (in thousands, at year end)6% 10,755 10,155 9,769Assets receiving ongoing advisory services (in billions, at year end)21% $1,699.8 $1,401.4 $1,253.7Client cash as a percentage of client assets (at year end) 10.8% 13.0% 13.0%Company Financial Metrics: Total net revenues15% $8,618 $7,478 $6,380Total expenses excluding interest11% 4,968 4,485 4,101Income before taxes on income22% 3,650 2,993 2,279Taxes on income17% 1,296 1,104 832Net income25% $2,354 $1,889 $1,447Preferred stock dividends and other22% 174 143 83Net income available to common stockholders25% $2,180 $1,746 $1,364Earnings per common share — diluted23% $1.61 $1.31 $1.03Net revenue growth from prior year 15% 17% 5%Pre-tax profit margin 42.4% 40.0% 35.7%Return on average common stockholders’ equity 15% 14% 12%Expenses excluding interest as a percentage of average client assets 0.16% 0.17% 0.16%Consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio (at year end) 7.6% 7.2% 7.1%(1) 2017 excludes an inflow of $34.5 billion relating to mutual fund clearing services clients. 2015 excludes an inflow of $6.1 billion to reflect the final impact of the consolidation of its retirement plan recordkeeping platforms, an inflow of $10.2 billion relating to a mutual fund clearing services client, and an outflow of $11.6 billion relating to the Company’s planned resignation from an Advisor Services cash management relationship netting to an adjustment of ($4.7) billion.2017 Compared to 2016 Net income available to common stockholders rose in 2017 by $434 million, or 25%, from the prior year, resulting in diluted EPS of $1.61 in 2017 – an increase of 23% compared to $1.31 in 2016. Net revenues improved by $1.1 billion, or 15%, while expenses excluding interest increased $483 million, or 11%, compared to 2016.Our steady focus on operating ‘through clients’ eyes’ and our goal to continually challenge the status quo helped Schwab achieve another strong growth year in 2017. Clients opened 1.4 million new brokerage accounts in 2017 and trusted Schwab with $198.6 billion of core net new assets in 2017, up 58% from 2016. Total assets receiving ongoing advisory services grew 21% in 2017 to $1.70 trillion. Our success with clients was bolstered by strength in the equity markets – the Standard & Poor’s 500® Index (S&P 500) finished 2017 up 19% from the prior year end. Also in 2017, the Federal Reserve increased - 24 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)the overnight federal funds target interest rate three times for a total of 75 basis points. Strong client activity and the positive economic environment resulted in total client assets rising to $3.36 trillion as of December 31, 2017 – a 21% increase since the end of 2016.Schwab’s 2017 financial results demonstrate the power of our financial formula working as designed: our robust business growth supported strong revenue growth through multiple sources in 2017, which we combined with continued expense discipline to drive significantly improved profitability. Net revenues grew by 15% in 2017 compared to 2016 through contributions from our two largest revenue sources. Net interest revenue rose 29% while asset management and administration fees grew 11% in 2017 when compared to the prior year. Trading revenue declined in 2017 by 21% due to price reductions announced early in 2017. Consistent with our expectations, expenses grew 11% in 2017 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation and higher staffing related to our strong asset gathering, as well as expenses related to project spending and third-party fees tied to higher balances in our asset management business. This combination of revenue growth and expense discipline drove the pre-tax profit margin to 42.4% – an increase of 240 basis points over the prior year. Earnings before income taxes rose 22% to $3.7 billion in 2017 compared to $3.0 billion in the prior year. The effective tax rate in 2017 was 35.5% compared to 36.9% in 2016 reflecting the benefit from the adoption of new accounting standards requiring the recognition of a portion of tax deductions related to equity compensation partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and other tax adjustments associated with the enactment in 2017 of a new tax act (see Current Regulatory Environment and Other Developments for more information). 2016 Compared to 2015 In 2016, net income available to common stockholders increased $382 million, or 28%, from the prior year, resulting in diluted EPS of $1.31 in 2016 compared to $1.03 in 2015. Net revenues improved by $1.1 billion, or 17%, while expenses excluding interest increased $384 million, or 9%, compared to 2015.Strong client momentum continued as our innovative, full-service model resonated with clients and drove growth during the year. We added 1.1 million new brokerage accounts to our client base during 2016, which contributed to bringing the total active brokerage accounts to 10.2 million by year-end. Core net new assets from new and existing clients totaled $125.5 billion in 2016, which helped grow total client assets to $2.78 trillion as of December 31, 2016. Also during 2016, investors increasingly turned to Schwab’s advice offerings resulting in a 12% increase in client assets enrolled in one of our retail advisory solutions and those guided by independent advisors, to $1.40 trillion at the end of the year.Client assets grew by 11% during an environment that had periods of marked volatility, but ultimately included improving economic conditions. The S&P 500 ended 2016 10% higher than the prior year end. After years of ultra-low interest rates, the Federal Reserve’s move to increase the overnight federal funds target rate by 25 basis points in December 2015 helped throughout 2016; the Federal Reserve’s subsequent additional 25 basis point increase in December 2016 had little time to impact 2016 results. Other short-term rates also rose in 2016. The one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) improved 34 basis points to .77% at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015. These external drivers and the solid client growth helped produce strong net revenue growth. Schwab’s 17% net revenue growth was led by increased net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees, which more than offset lower revenue from trading and other revenue. Net interest revenue improved $797 million, or 32%, in 2016 compared to 2015, and asset management and administration fees improved $405 million, or 15%.Strong net revenue growth provided room for increased investment in people and technology, resulting in a 9% expense growth for 2016. This increase allowed for a 780 basis point gap between net revenue and expense growth and a pre-tax profit margin of 40.0% in 2016, compared to 35.7% in 2015.- 25 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Subsequent EventOn February 8, 2018, CSC redeemed all of its outstanding 1.500% Senior Notes due March 10, 2018. The aggregate principal amount of the notes was $625 million. Current Regulatory Environment and Other DevelopmentsOn December 22, 2017, P.L.115-97, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), was signed into law. Among other things, the Tax Act lowers the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective for tax years including or commencing January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate, generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP) require companies to remeasure their deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of the date of enactment, with the resulting tax effects accounted for in the reporting period of enactment. Schwab has recorded a one-time non-cash charge to taxes on income associated with the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and other tax adjustments related to the tax reform legislation in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our 2018 effective income tax rate will be reduced as a result of these changes. In May 2016, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC jointly issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would impose a minimum NSFR on certain banking organizations, including CSC. The comment period for the proposed rule ended on August 5, 2016 and the impact to the Company cannot be assessed until the final rule is released.In October 2015, the Federal Reserve issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity and long-term debt that, among other things, would have required certain financial institutions that are subject to the Federal Reserve’s capital rules to deduct from their regulatory capital the amount of any investments in or exposure to unsecured debt issued by U.S. bank holding companies identified as global systemically important banking organizations (GSIBs). In December 2016, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule that did not include this regulatory capital deduction proposal. At the same time, the Federal Reserve did indicate its intent to work with the OCC and FDIC to develop a proposed interagency approach towards the regulatory capital treatment of GSIB unsecured debt. The Company will evaluate any such proposal when it is issued.- 26 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)RESULTS OF OPERATIONSTotal Net RevenuesTotal net revenues of $8.6 billion and $7.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, grew 15% and 17% from the prior periods, reflecting significant improvements in both net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees.

Revenue on interest-earning assets is affected by various factors, such as the composition of assets, prevailing interest rates at the time of origination or purchase, changes in interest rates on floating rate securities, and changes in prepayment levels for mortgage-related securities and loans. Fees earned on securities borrowing and lending activities, which are conducted by CS&Co on assets held in client brokerage accounts, are included in other interest revenue and expense.Schwab’s interest-bearing liabilities include bank deposits, payables to brokerage clients, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt. We establish the rates paid on client-related liabilities, and management expects that it will generally adjust the rates paid on these liabilities at some fraction of any movement in short-term rates. Client-related liabilities have historically been very stable and are largely expected to remain so. Given the stability and low rate sensitivity of these liabilities, management believes their duration is relatively long, somewhere in excess of three and a half years.Management believes that the extended period of extraordinarily low interest rates running from the financial crisis to the present has likely resulted in certain sweep cash balances retaining some level of latent rate sensitivity. To the extent short-term rates increase, management expects some sweep cash balances to migrate to purchased money market funds or other higher-yielding alternatives. At the same time, Schwab will retain the opportunity to migrate the remaining non-rate sensitive cash in sweep money market funds to bank sweep deposits.We have positioned Schwab to benefit from an increase in interest rates, especially short-term interest rates, by managing the duration of interest-earning assets to be shorter than that of interest-bearing liabilities, so that asset yields will move faster than liability costs.In order to keep interest-rate sensitivity within established limits, management monitors and responds to changes in the balance sheet. As Schwab builds its client base, we attract new client sweep cash, which, along with the bulk transfer of - 27 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)existing sweep cash balances from money market funds, is a primary driver of balance sheet growth. As the proportion of sweep cash balances to total liabilities has grown, the measured duration of liabilities has grown as well. By increasing the duration of interest-earning assets as necessary, we are positioned to continue to gain from increasing rates while limiting exposure to falling rates to an acceptable level. Approximately half of our investment securities and loans re-price or reset based on short-term interest rates such as one-month LIBOR. Non-interest-bearing funding sources include certain cash balances, stockholders’ equity and other miscellaneous assets and liabilities.The following table presents net interest revenue information corresponding to interest-earning assets and funding sources on the consolidated balance sheets:Year Ended December 31,2017 2016 2015 AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense Average Yield/Rate AverageBalance Interest Revenue/Expense Average Yield/Rate AverageBalance Interest Revenue/Expense Average Yield/RateInterest-earning assets: Cash and cash equivalents$9,931 $109 1.10% $11,143 $57 0.51% $9,358 $24 0.26%Cash and investments segregated18,525 166 0.90% 20,104 93 0.46% 18,606 31 0.17%Broker-related receivables (1)430 3 0.70% 558 1 0.22% 274 — 0.07%Receivables from brokerage clients16,269 575 3.53% 15,001 497 3.31% 15,212 502 3.30%Available for sale securities (2)53,040 815 1.54% 72,586 883 1.22% 62,249 629 1.01%Held to maturity securities103,599 2,354 2.27% 57,451 1,402 2.44% 38,280 957 2.50%Bank loans15,919 472 2.97% 14,715 400 2.72% 13,973 369 2.64%Total interest-earning assets217,713 4,494 2.06% 191,558 3,333 1.74% 157,952 2,512 1.59%Other interest revenue 130 160 145 Total interest-earning assets$217,713 $4,624 2.12% $191,558 $3,493 1.82% $157,952 $2,657 1.68%Funding sources: Bank deposits$163,998 $148 0.09% $141,432 $37 0.03% $113,464 $29 0.03%Payables to brokerage clients25,403 16 0.06% 26,311 3 0.01% 25,651 2 0.01%Short-term borrowings (1)3,503 41 1.17% 1,864 9 0.48% 21 — 0.27%Long-term debt3,431 119 3.47% 2,876 104 3.62% 2,717 92 3.39%Total interest-bearing liabilities196,335 324 0.17% 172,483 153 0.09% 141,853 123 0.09%Non-interest-bearing funding sources21,378 19,075 16,099 Other interest expense 18 18 9 Total funding sources$217,713 $342 0.15% $191,558 $171 0.09% $157,952 $132 0.08%Net interest revenue $4,282 1.97% $3,322 1.73% $2,525 1.60%(1) Interest revenue or expense was less than $500,000 in the period or periods presented.(2) Amounts calculated based on amortized cost.Net interest revenue increased $960 million or 29%, in 2017 from 2016, and $797 million, or 32%, in 2016 from 2015, primarily due to higher interest rates and growth in interest-earning assets driven by bank deposits. Higher short-term interest rates reflecting the Federal Reserve’s December, June, and March 2017 and December 2016 interest rate hikes, coupled with growth in interest-earning assets, have resulted in a 24 basis point improvement in net interest margin to 1.97% in 2017. Net interest margin was 1.73% in 2016, representing an improvement of 13 basis points compared to 2015. - 28 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)In 2017 and 2016, average interest earning assets have grown by 14% and 21%, respectively, from the prior years. This growth has been driven primarily by higher bank deposits, which increased through a combination of: •Gathering additional assets from new and current clients;•Transferring uninvested cash balances in certain client brokerage accounts to the bank sweep feature; and•Establishing the bank sweep feature as the default investment option for uninvested cash balances within all new Investor and Advisor Services brokerage accounts during 2016.In 2017, clients allocated more of their cash to equity, fixed income and other investments which affected growth in bank sweep deposits.In March 2017, $24.7 billion of debt securities were transferred from the AFS category to the HTM category. The transfer had no effect on the overall net interest margin. For additional information on the transfer, see Item 8 – Note 5.Asset Management and Administration FeesAsset management and administration fees include mutual fund and ETF service fees and fees for other asset-based financial services provided to individual and institutional clients. Schwab earns mutual fund and ETF service fees for shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. Asset management and administration fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in these funds and do not include securities lending revenues earned by proprietary mutual funds and ETFs, as those amounts, net of program fees, are credited to the fund shareholders. The fair values of client assets included in proprietary and third-party mutual funds and ETFs are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data.We also earn asset management fees for advice solutions, which include managed portfolios, specialized strategies, and customized investment advice. Other asset management and administration fees include various asset-based fees such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, mutual fund clearing fees, collective trust fund fees, and non-balance based service and transaction fees.Asset management and administration fees vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity. The following table presents a roll forward of client assets for the Schwab money market funds, Schwab equity and bond funds and ETFs, and Mutual Fund OneSource® and other non-transaction fee (NTF) funds.

Prior periods have been adjusted to accommodate this change.(3) Includes various asset-related fees, such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, and mutual fund clearing fees and other service fees. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, a prospective methodology change was made to average client assets relating to 401(k) recordkeeping fees to provide improved insight into the associated fee driver, which resulted in an increase of approximately $25 billion. There was no impact to revenue or the average fee.(4) Includes miscellaneous service and transaction fees relating to mutual funds and ETFs that are not balance-based.Asset management and administration fees increased by $337 million, or 11%, in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to higher average client assets invested in advice solutions, mutual funds, and ETFs, and lower fee waivers on money market funds. Partially offsetting these increases were lower fee rates on proprietary money funds and other indexed mutual funds and ETFs due to fee reductions implemented by Schwab in 2017. Asset management and administration fees increased by $405 million, or 15%, in 2016 from 2015 due to higher net yields on money market fund assets as short-term interest rates rose in 2016, and growth in client assets enrolled in advisory offers, partially offset by a reduction in client assets in Mutual Fund OneSource.Trading RevenueTrading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenue is affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. Principal transaction revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from trading activity in fixed income securities with clients. To accommodate clients’ fixed income trading activity, Schwab maintains positions in fixed income securities, including U.S. state and municipal debt obligations, U.S. Government and corporate debt, and other securities. The difference between the price at which the Company buys and sells securities to and from its clients and other broker-dealers is recognized as principal transaction revenue. Principal transaction revenue also includes adjustments to the fair value of these securities positions.- 30 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)The following table presents trading revenue and the related drivers:Year Ended December 31,Growth Rate2016-2017 2017 2016 2015DARTs (in thousands)10 % 321.3 291.6 292.0Clients’ daily average trades (in thousands)8 % 608.8 561.8 536.9Number of trading days(1)% 250.0 251.5 251.0Daily average revenue per revenue trade(27)% $8.20 $11.23 $11.83Trading revenue(21)% $654 $825 $866Trading revenue decreased by $171 million and $41 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, when compared to the prior years primarily due to lower commissions rates on DARTs. During the first quarter of 2017, we announced two trading price reductions which lowered standard equity, ETF, and option trade commissions from $8.95 to $4.95 and lowered the per contract option fee from $.75 to $.65. These reductions in commission rates reflect our continuing belief that pricing should never be an obstacle for choosing Schwab and our commitment to share the benefits of scale with clients. With these changes, trading revenue has declined from a peak of 50%-60% of total revenue in the early 1990’s to the current low of 8% in 2017, 11% in 2016 and 14% in 2015.Other RevenueOther revenue includes order flow revenue, other service fees, software fees from our portfolio management solutions, exchange processing fees, and nonrecurring gains.Order flow revenue was $114 million during 2017, and $103 million for both 2016 and 2015. In 2016 and 2015, other revenue also included net litigation proceeds of $16 and $75 million, respectively, relating to our non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities portfolios.- 31 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Total Expenses Excluding InterestThe following table shows a comparison of total expenses excluding interest: Growth Rate 2016-2017 2017 2016 2015Compensation and benefits Salaries and wages9 % $1,496 $1,368 $1,258Incentive compensation16 % 797 689 618Employee benefits and other9 % 444 409 365Total compensation and benefits11 % $2,737 $2,466 $2,241Professional services15 % 580 506 459Occupancy and equipment10 % 436 398 353Advertising and market development1 % 268 265 249Communications(3)% 231 237 233Depreciation and amortization15 % 269 234 224Regulatory fees and assessments24 % 179 144 107Other14 % 268 235 235Total expenses excluding interest11 % $4,968 $4,485 $4,101Expenses as a percentage of total net revenues: Compensation and benefits 32% 33% 35%Advertising and market development 3% 4% 4%Full-time equivalent employees (in thousands): At year end9 % 17.6 16.2 15.3Average6 % 16.9 15.9 15.1໿Expenses excluding interest increased in 2017 and 2016 from the prior years by 11% and 9%, respectively. The largest drivers of the increase in both years were compensation and benefits and professional services. Salaries and wages increased in 2017 and 2016 from the prior years, primarily due to increases in employee headcount to support the growth in the business and annual salary increases. Incentive compensation increased in 2017 and 2016 from the prior years, primarily due to increased net client asset flows and increased employee headcount. Employee benefits and other expenses increased in 2017 and 2016 from the prior years as a result of the increases in employee headcount, salaries, wages and incentive compensation. Professional services expense increased in 2017 and 2016 from the prior years, primarily due to higher spending on technology projects and an increase in asset management and administration related expenses resulting from growth in the Schwab Funds® and Schwab ETFs™. Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2017 and 2016 from the prior years, primarily due to increased software maintenance expense relating to information technology systems and increases in facility operational expenses attributable to growth in Schwab’s geographic footprint.Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in 2017 and 2016 from the prior years, due to higher amortization of internally developed software associated with our investment in software and technology enhancements.- 32 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Regulatory fees assessments increased in 2017 and 2016 from the prior years, primarily due to an increase in FDIC insurance assessments which rose as a result of higher bank deposits and the effect of a new surcharge that commenced in the third quarter of 2016.Other expenses have increased in 2017 from the prior year due to travel and entertainment, asset volume-related increases, and some miscellaneous items. Capital expenditures were $412 million, $353 million, and $285 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures in both 2017 and 2016 from the prior years was due to our growing geographical expansion in the U.S. and investments in technology projects. The largest component of capital expenditures was capitalized costs for developing internal-use software of $157 million, $130 million, and $107 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Taxes on IncomeEffective January 1, 2017, Schwab adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09, which prospectively changes the accounting treatment of a portion of the tax deductions relating to equity compensation. These deductions were previously reflected directly in additional paid-in capital, a component of stockholders’ equity, and are now included in taxes on income, a component of net income. As a result of this change, our tax expense was reduced by approximately $87 million in 2017. Future effects will depend on our share price, restricted stock vesting, and the volume of equity incentive options exercised.As previously discussed under Current Regulatory Environment and Other Developments, the Tax Act was signed into law during 2017. Among other things, the Tax Act lowers the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective for tax years including or commencing January 1, 2018. In connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, Schwab recognized a $46 million one-time non-cash charge to taxes on income in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and other tax adjustments related to the Tax Act. Schwab’s effective income tax rate on income before taxes was 35.5% in 2017 compared to 36.9% in 2016. The decrease in rates between the two years reflects the net impact of the above two items. The effective rate in 2015 was 36.5%. We estimate our effective income tax rate to be between 23% and 24% in 2018 as a result of the Tax Act.Segment InformationSchwab provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments – Investor Services and Advisor Services. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services, retirement plan services, and other corporate brokerage services to individual investors. The Advisor Services segment provides custodial, trading, banking, and support services as well as retirement business services to independent RIAs, independent retirement advisors and recordkeepers. Revenues and expenses are attributed to the two segments based on which segment services the client. Management evaluates the performance of the segments on a pre-tax basis. Segment assets and liabilities are not used for evaluating segment performance or in deciding how to allocate resources to segments. Net revenues in both segments are generated from the underlying client assets and trading activity; differences in the composition of net revenues between the segments are based on the composition of client assets, client trading frequency, and pricing unique to each. While both segments leverage the scale and efficiency of our platforms, segment expenses reflect the dynamics of serving millions of clients in Investor Services versus the thousands of RIAs on the advisor platform.- 33 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Financial information for our segments is presented in the following table: Investor Services Advisor Services Total Growth Rate2016-2017 2017 2016 2015 Growth Rate2016-2017 2017 2016 2015 Growth Rate2016-2017 2017 2016 2015Year Ended December 31, Net Revenues Net interest revenue 25 % $3,231 $2,591 $2,133 44 % $1,051 $731 $392 29 % $4,282 $3,322 $2,525Asset management and administration fees 12 % 2,344 2,093 1,837 9 % 1,048 962 813 11 % 3,392 3,055 2,650Trading revenue (22)% 408 524 556 (18)% 246 301 310 (21)% 654 825 866Other 9 % 217 199 234 1 % 73 72 94 7 % 290 271 328Provision for loan losses (100)% — 4 11 (100)% — 1 — (100)% — 5 11Total net revenues 15 % 6,200 5,411 4,771 17 % 2,418 2,067 1,609 15 % 8,618 7,478 6,380Expenses Excluding Interest 10 % 3,725 3,380 3,090 12 % 1,243 1,105 1,011 11 % 4,968 4,485 4,101Income before taxes on income 22 % $2,475 $2,031 $1,681 22 % $1,175 $962 $598 22 % $3,650 $2,993 $2,279Investor ServicesTotal net revenues increased by $789 million, or 15%, in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees, partially offset by a decrease in trading revenue.

Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher balances of interest-earning assets and higher net interest margins. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to higher fees from growth in client assets invested in ETFs and equity and bond funds, and higher net fees on money market fund assets. Trading revenue decreased primarily due to lower commission rates. Expenses excluding interest increased by $138 million, or 12%, in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, technology project spend, asset management and administration related expenses, and regulatory fee assessments.Total net revenues increased by $458 million, or 28%, in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher balances of interest-earning assets and higher interest rates on those assets. This growth in assets was bolstered by the migration of more uninvested client cash balances in the segment to Schwab Bank. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to higher net yields on money market fund assets. Expenses excluding interest increased by $94 million, or 9%, in 2016 from 2015 primarily due to increases in growth in the business resulting in increases in compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment, and other expenses.- 34 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)RISK MANAGEMENTSchwab’s business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, credit, market, liquidity, and compliance risk. The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that Schwab will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks.Our risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting, and risk mitigation. The activities and governance that comprise the risk management process are described below.CultureThe Board of Directors has approved an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework that incorporates our purpose, vision, and values that form the bedrock of our corporate culture and set the tone for the organization.We designed the ERM Framework to enable a comprehensive approach to managing risks encountered by Schwab in its business activities. The framework incorporates key concepts commensurate with the size, risk profile, complexity, and continuing growth of the Company. Risk appetite, which is defined as the amount of risk the Company is willing to accept in pursuit of its corporate strategy, is developed by executive management and approved by the Board of Directors.Risk GovernanceSenior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling risks. The Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior executives from each major business and control function, is responsible for the oversight of risk management. This includes identifying emerging risks, assessing risk management practices and the control environment, reinforcing business accountability for risk management, supervisory controls and regulatory compliance, supporting resource prioritization across the organization, and escalating significant issues to the Board of Directors.We have established risk metrics and reporting that enable measurement of the impact of strategy execution against risk appetite. The risk metrics, with risk limits and tolerance levels, are established for key risk categories by the Global Risk Committee and its functional risk sub-committees.The Global Risk Committee reports, through the Chief Risk Officer, regularly to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. The Risk Committee in turn assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to our risk management program, including approving risk appetite statements and related key risk appetite metrics and reviewing reports relating to risk issues from functional areas of risk management, legal, compliance, and internal audit.Functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report to the Global Risk Committee. These sub-committees include the:•Compliance Risk Committee – provides oversight of compliance risk management programs and policies providing an aggregate view of compliance risk exposure;•Financial Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of and approves credit, liquidity, capital and market risk policies, limits, and exposures;•New Products and Services Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of, and approves corporate policy and procedures relating to the risk governance of new products and services; and•Operational Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of and approves operational risk management policies, risk tolerance levels, and operational risk governance processes, and includes sub-committees covering Fiduciary, Data, Information Security, Model Governance, and Third-Party risk.- 35 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Senior management has also created an Incentive Compensation Risk Oversight Committee, which establishes policy and reviews and approves the Annual Risk Assessment of incentive compensation plans, and reports directly to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Company’s compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and corporate risk management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring risk management.In addition, the Disclosure Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.Operational RiskOperational risks arise due to potential inadequacies or failures related to people, internal processes, and systems, or from external events or relationships impacting the Company and/or any of its key business partners and third parties. While operational risk is inherent in all business activities, we rely on a system of internal controls and risk management practices designed to keep operational risk and operational losses within the Company’s risk appetite. We have specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and use periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. Where appropriate, we manage the impact of operational loss and litigation expense through the purchase of insurance. The insurance program is specifically designed to address our key operational risks and to maintain compliance with local laws and regulation.Schwab’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity and resiliency of our critical business functions and technology systems. To the extent Schwab experiences business or system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, technological failure, cyber attacks, changes to systems, linkages with third-party systems, and power failures), our business and operations could be negatively impacted. To minimize business interruptions, Schwab maintains a backup and recovery infrastructure which includes facilities for backup and communications, a geographically dispersed workforce, and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans.Information Security risk is the risk of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, recording or destruction of the firm’s information or systems. We have designed and implemented an information security program that knits together complementary tools, controls and technologies to protect systems, client accounts and data. We continuously monitor the systems and work collaboratively with government agencies, law enforcement and other financial institutions to address potential threats. We use advanced monitoring systems to identify suspicious activity and deter unauthorized access by internal or external actors. We limit the number of employees who have access to clients’ personal information and internal authentication measures are enforced to protect against the potential for social engineering. All employees who handle sensitive information are trained in privacy and security. Schwab’s fraud and cyber security teams monitor activity looking for suspicious behavior. These capabilities allow us to identify and quickly act on any attempted intrusions.Schwab also faces operational risk when we employ the services of various third parties, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. We manage the exposure to third party risk through contractual provisions, control standards, ongoing monitoring of third party performance, and appropriate testing. We maintain policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with all data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-public client information. We clearly define for employees, contractors, and third parties the expected standards of care for confidential data. We also provide regular training on data security.Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. We manage this risk by establishing policy and procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the policy and procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees.- 36 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. Models are owned by several business units throughout the organization, and are used for a variety of purposes. Model use includes, but is not limited to, calculating capital requirements for hypothetical stressful environments, estimating interest and credit risk for loans and other balance sheet assets, and providing guidance in the management of client portfolios. We have established a policy to describe the roles and responsibilities of all key stakeholders in model development, management, and use. All models are registered in a centralized database and classified into different risk ratings depending on their potential financial, reputational, or regulatory impact to the Company. The model risk rating determines the scope of model governance activities.Compliance RiskSchwab faces compliance risk which is the potential exposure to legal or regulatory sanctions, fines or penalties, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, or other regulatory requirements. Among other things, compliance risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of our controls. The Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, including SROs. We manage compliance risk through policies, procedures and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, client privacy, and employment policies. Credit RiskCredit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform on its contractual obligations. Our exposure to credit risk mainly results from investing activities in our liquidity and investment portfolios, mortgage lending, margin lending and client option and futures activities, pledged asset lending, securities lending activities, and our role as a counterparty in other financial contracts. To manage the risks of such losses, we have established policies and procedures, which include establishing and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin, PAL, option, and futures requirements for certain securities and instruments. Liquidity and Investment PortfoliosSchwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios, which include U.S. agency, and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. state and municipal securities, and commercial paper.At December 31, 2017, substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade. U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.Mortgage Lending PortfolioThe bank loan portfolio includes First Mortgages, HELOCs, and other loans. The credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual loan and portfolio reviews. Management regularly reviews asset quality, including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for loan losses.Our residential loan underwriting guidelines include maximum LTV ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan size is conforming or jumbo). - 37 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Schwab does not originate or purchase residential loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. For more information on credit quality indicators relating to Schwab’s bank loans, see Item 8 – Note 6. Securities and Instrument-Based Lending PortfoliosCollateral arrangements relating to margin loans, PALs, option and futures positions, securities lending agreements, and resale agreements include provisions that require additional collateral in the event of market fluctuations. Additionally, for margin loans, PALs, options and futures positions, and securities lending agreements, collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral sufficiently exceeds the credit exposure in order to maintain a fully secured position.Other Counterparty ExposuresSchwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab’s clients or a counterparty fail to meet their obligations to Schwab.Market RiskMarket risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by Schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, or market conditions. We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on our interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources that finance these assets. Net interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may reprice at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short and long-term interest rates. Interest-earning assets primarily include investment securities, margin loans and bank loans. These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment. Because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans, and control the composition of our investment securities, we have some ability to manage our net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions.To mitigate the risk of declining interest revenue, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk, and monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of our interest-earning assets and funding sources. To remain within these guidelines, we manage the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios.Financial instruments are also subject to the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument. We are indirectly exposed to option, futures, and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option and futures accounts, securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers, and client securities loaned out as part of the brokerage securities lending activities. Equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity, margin borrowing, and overall client engagement with Schwab. Additionally, we earn mutual fund and ETF service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets. Fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue we earn.Our market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material.- 38 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Net Interest Revenue SimulationFor Schwab’s net interest revenue sensitivity analysis, we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulation includes all interest-sensitive assets and liabilities. Key variables in the simulation include the repricing of financial instruments, prepayment, reinvestment, and product pricing assumptions. The simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies, including changes in asset and liability mix.If our guidelines for net interest revenue sensitivity are breached, management must report the breach to the Financial Risk Oversight Committee and establish a plan to address the interest rate risk. There were no breaches of our net interest revenue sensitivity risk limits during the years ended December 31, 2017 or 2016.As represented by the simulations presented below, our investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall.The simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheets would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As we actively manage the consolidated balance sheets and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment. The following table shows the simulated net interest revenue change over the next 12 months beginning December 31, 2017 and 2016 of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period.December 31,20172016Increase of 100 basis points3.3 %6.5 %Decrease of 100 basis points(6.2)%(9.8)%The change in net interest revenue sensitivities as of December 31, 2017 reflects the increase in short-term interest rates. An increase in short-term interest rates positively impacts net interest revenue as yields on interest-earning assets rise faster than the cost of funding sources. A decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the investment and loan portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources, compressing net interest margin. Liquidity RiskLiquidity risk is the potential that Schwab will be unable to meet cash flow obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses.Due to its role as a source of financial strength, CSC’s liquidity needs are primarily driven by the liquidity and capital needs of CS&Co, the capital needs of the bank subsidiaries, the amount of dividend payments on CSC’s common and preferred stock and principal and interest due on corporate debt. The liquidity needs of CS&Co are primarily driven by client activity including trading and margin borrowing activities and capital expenditures, and the capital needs of the bank subsidiaries are primarily driven by client deposits. We have established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies, while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions. We seek to maintain client confidence in the balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the Company to meet its obligations. To this end, we have established limits and contingency funding scenarios to support liquidity levels during both business as usual and stressed conditions.We employ a variety of methodologies to monitor and manage liquidity. We conduct regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific liquidity stress events. Liquidity is also tested at key subsidiaries and results are reported to the Financial Risk Oversight Committee. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the organization and are reviewed with management as appropriate.The Company is subject to and was in compliance with the modified LCR rule at December 31, 2017.- 39 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Primary Funding SourcesSchwab’s primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity: bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts. These funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients. Other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, repayments on loans, securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts, and cash provided by external financing or equity offerings.To meet daily funding needs, we maintain liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments. For unanticipated liquidity needs, a buffer of highly liquid investments, currently comprised of U.S. Treasury notes, is also maintained.Additional Funding SourcesIn addition to internal sources of liquidity, Schwab has access to external funding. The need for short-term borrowings from these facilities arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest-earning investments, movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements and general corporate purposes. We maintain policies and procedures necessary to access funding and test discount window borrowing procedures on a periodic basis.The following table describes external debt facilities are available at December 31, 2017:DescriptionBorrowerOutstandingAvailableCommitted, unsecured credit facility with various external banks (1)CSC$—$750Uncommitted, unsecured lines of credit with various external banksCSC, CS&Co—1,199Federal Reserve Bank discount window (2)Schwab Bank—2,458Federal Home Loan Bank secured credit facility (3)Schwab Bank15,00017,301Unsecured commercial paper (4)CSC—750(1) Other than an overnight borrowing to test availability, this facility was unused during 2017.(2) Amounts available are dependent on the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral. (3) Amounts available are dependent on the amount of First Mortgages, HELOCs, and the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral. (4) CSC has authorization from its Board of Directors to issue Commercial Paper Notes to not exceed $1.5 billion. Management has set a current limit not to exceed the amount of the committed, unsecured credit facility.The financial covenants for the $750 million committed credit facility require CS&Co to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, Schwab Bank to be well capitalized, and CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity, adjusted to exclude AOCI. At December 31, 2017, the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was $12.5 billion (CSC’s stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, at December 31, 2017 was $18.7 billion). Management believes these restrictions will not have a material effect on CSC’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements.Schwab Bank has access to short-term secured funding through the Federal Reserve’s discount window. Amounts available under the Federal Reserve discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain of Schwab Bank’s investment securities that are pledged as collateral. Schwab Bank also maintains a secured credit facility with the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB). Amounts available under this facility are dependent on the amount of Schwab Bank’s First Mortgages, HELOCs, and the fair value of certain of Schwab Bank’s investment securities that are pledged as collateral. During 2017, Schwab Bank used borrowings under this agreement to purchase investment securities prior to bulk transfers. This credit facility is also available as backup financing in the event of the outflow of client cash from Schwab Bank’s balance sheet. CSC has a commercial paper program of which proceeds are used for general corporate purposes. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes may vary, but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue. CSC’s ratings for these short-term borrowings are P1 by Moody’s, A1 by Standard & Poor’s, and F1 by Fitch. CSC had no Commercial Paper Notes outstanding at December 31, 2017 or 2016.- 40 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)To partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation, CS&Co has unsecured standby letter of credit agreements (LOCs) with several banks in favor of the Options Clearing Corporation aggregating $225 million at December 31, 2017. There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs during 2017 or 2016. In connection with its securities lending activities, the Company is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. The collateral requirements were satisfied by providing cash as collateral.CSC has a universal automatic shelf registration statement (Shelf Registration Statement) on file with the SEC, which enables it to issue debt, equity, and other securities.BorrowingsLong-term debt outstanding was $4.8 billion and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Short-term borrowings outstanding from FHLB were $15.0 billion at December 31, 2017 and there were none at December 31, 2016.

These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, Schwab enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements in the ordinary course of business. For information on each of these arrangements, see Item 8 – Note 6, Note 10, Note 12, Note 13, and Note 14. Contractual ObligationsSchwab’s principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 are shown in the following table. We believe that funds generated by continuing operations, as well as cash provided by external financing, will continue to be the primary funding sources in meeting these obligations. Excluded from this table are liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets that are generally short-term in nature (e.g., payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations and short-term borrowings) or without contractual payment terms (e.g., bank deposits, payables to brokerage clients, and deferred compensation).December 31, 2017Less than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5Years More than5 Years TotalCredit-related financial instruments (1)$1,622 $2,842 $4,254 $1,945 $10,663Long-term debt (2)1,022 954 192 3,429 5,597Purchase obligations (3)305 219 48 181 753Leases (4)127 194 120 289 730Total$3,076 $4,209 $4,614 $5,844 $17,743(1) Represents Schwab Bank’s commitments to extend credit to banking clients, purchase mortgage loans, and commitments to fund CRA investments.(2) Includes estimated future interest payments through 2028 for Senior Notes.

Schwab’s primary sources of capital are funds generated by the operations of subsidiaries and securities issuances by CSC in the capital markets. To ensure that Schwab has sufficient capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values, we have adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios.Internal guidelines are set, for both CSC and its regulated subsidiaries, to ensure capital levels are in line with our strategy and regulatory requirements. Capital forecasts are reviewed monthly at Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee and Financial Risk Oversight Committee meetings. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify potential problems that could impact capital. In addition, we monitor the subsidiaries’ capital levels and requirements. Subject to regulatory capital requirements and any required approvals, any excess capital held by subsidiaries is transferred to CSC in the form of dividends and returns of capital. When subsidiaries have need of additional capital, funds are provided by CSC as equity investments and also as subordinated loans (in a form approved as regulatory capital by regulators) for CS&Co. The details and method used for each cash infusion are based on an analysis of the particular entity’s needs and financing alternatives. The amounts and structure of infusions must take into consideration maintenance of regulatory capital requirements, debt/equity ratios, and equity double leverage ratios.Schwab conducts regular capital stress testing to assess the potential financial impacts of various adverse macroeconomic and company-specific events to which the Company could be subjected. The objective of the capital stress testing is (1) to explore various potential outcomes – including rare and extreme events and (2) to assess impacts of potential stressful outcomes on both capital and liquidity. Additionally, we have a comprehensive Capital Contingency Plan to provide action plans for certain low probability/high impact capital events that the Company might face. The Capital Contingency Plan is issued under the authority of the Financial Risk Oversight Committee and provides guidelines for sustained capital events. It - 42 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)does not specifically address every contingency, but is designed to provide a framework for responding to any capital stress. The results of the stress testing indicate there are two scenarios which could stress the Company’s capital: (1) inflows of balance sheet cash during a period of very low interest rates and (2) outflows of balance sheet cash when other sources of financing are not available and the Company is required to sell assets to fund the flows at a loss. The Capital Contingency Plan is reviewed annually and updated as appropriate.For additional information, see Business – Regulation in Part I, Item 1.Regulatory Capital RequirementsCSC is subject to capital requirements set by the Federal Reserve and is required to serve as a source of strength for Schwab Bank and to provide financial assistance if Schwab Bank experiences financial distress. Schwab is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for CSC of at least 4%; however, management seeks to maintain the ratio of at least 6%. Due to the relatively low risk of our balance sheet assets and risk-based capital ratios at CSC and Schwab Bank that are well in excess of regulatory requirements, the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint on CSC’s asset growth.Banking subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements set by their regulators that are substantially similar to those imposed on CSC by the Federal Reserve. Banking subsidiaries’ failure to remain well capitalized could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that could have a direct material effect on the bank. Schwab’s principal banking subsidiary, Schwab Bank, is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of at least 5% to be well capitalized, but seeks to maintain the ratio of at least 6.25%. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2017, Schwab Bank is considered well capitalized.The following table details CSC’s consolidated and Schwab Bank’s capital ratios:December 31,2017 2016 CSC Schwab Bank CSC Schwab BankTotal stockholders’ equity$18,525 $13,224 $16,421 $11,726Less: Preferred Stock2,793 — 2,783 —Common Equity Tier 1 Capital before regulatory adjustments$15,732 $13,224 $13,638 $11,726Less: Goodwill, net of associated deferred tax liabilities$1,191 $13 $1,175 $11Other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities61 — 52 —Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances and deferred tax liabilities2 — — —AOCI adjustment (1)(152) (144) (163) (163)Common Equity Tier 1 Capital $14,630 $13,355 $12,574 $11,878Tier 1 Capital$17,423 $13,355 $15,357 $11,878Total Capital17,452 13,382 15,384 11,904Risk-Weighted Assets75,866 66,519 68,179 59,915Common Equity Tier 1 Capital/Risk-Weighted Assets19.3% 20.1% 18.4% 19.8%Tier 1 Capital/Risk-Weighted Assets23.0% 20.1% 22.5% 19.8%Total Capital/Risk-Weighted Assets23.0% 20.1% 22.6% 19.9%Tier 1 Leverage Ratio7.6% 7.1% 7.2% 7.0%(1) CSC and Schwab Bank have elected to opt-out of the requirement to include most components of AOCI in CET1 Capital.Schwab Bank is also subject to regulatory requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions. In addition, Schwab Bank is required to provide notice to, and may be required to obtain approval from, the OCC and the Federal Reserve to declare dividends to the parent company.As a broker-dealer, CS&Co is subject to regulatory requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule. The rule is intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit CS&Co from paying cash dividends, making unsecured advances and loans to the parent company and employees, and repaying subordinated borrowings from CSC if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or - 43 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000. As such, CS&Co is required to maintain, at all times, at least the minimum level of net capital required under Rule 15c3-1. At December 31, 2017, CS&Co exceeded the net capital requirements.In addition to the capital requirements above, the Company’s subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure financial soundness and liquidity. See Item 8 – Note 21 for additional information on the components of stockholders’ equity and information on the capital requirements of each of the subsidiaries.DividendsSince the initial dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 115 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend rate 21 times, resulting in a 20% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, CSC currently targets its common stock cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income.On April 21, 2016 the Board of Directors of the Company declared a one cent, or 17%, increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.07 per common share. On January 26, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a one cent, or 14%, increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.08 per common share. On January 25, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a two cent, or 25% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.10 per common share.The following table details the CSC cash dividends paid and per share amounts:Year Ended December 31,2017 2016 Cash PaidPer ShareAmount Cash PaidPer ShareAmountCommon Stock$431$0.32 $360$0.27Series A Preferred Stock (1)2870.00 2870.00Series B Preferred Stock (2,6)2960.00 2960.00Series C Preferred Stock (2)3660.00 3660.00Series D Preferred Stock (2,3)4559.52 3343.65Series E Preferred Stock (4)233,867.01 N/AN/ASeries F Preferred Stock (5)N/AN/A N/AN/A(1) Dividends paid semi-annually until February 1, 2022 and quarterly thereafter.(2) Dividends paid quarterly.(3) Series D Preferred Stock was issued on March 7, 2016.(4) Series E Preferred Stock was issued on October 31, 2016.

As of December 31, 2017, CSC had remaining authority from the Board of Directors to repurchase up to $596 million of its common stock, which is not subject to expiration.- 44 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)FOREIGN HOLDINGSAt December 31, 2017, Schwab had exposure to non-sovereign financial and non-financial institutions in foreign countries of $5.7 billion, with the fair value of the top three exposures being to issuers and counterparties domiciled in Sweden at $1.6 billion, France at $1.3 billion and Canada at $0.8 billion. At December 31, 2017, Schwab held AFS and HTM securities with a total fair value of $99 million issued by agencies of foreign governments. These securities are explicitly guaranteed by governments of issuing agencies.In addition to the direct holdings in foreign companies and securities issued by foreign government agencies, Schwab has indirect exposure to foreign countries through its investments in CSIM money market funds (collectively, the Funds) resulting from brokerage clearing activities. At December 31, 2017, the Company had $135 million in investments in these Funds. Certain of the Funds’ positions include certificates of deposits, time deposits, commercial paper and corporate debt securities issued by counterparties in foreign countries. Schwab had outstanding margin loans to foreign residents of $660 million at December 31, 2017.FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSSchwab uses the market approach to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, and to determine fair value disclosures. See Item 8 – Note 2 and Note 15 for more information on our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value.When available, Schwab uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. When utilizing market data and bid-ask spread, we use the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices do not exist, prices are obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets. We generally obtain prices from at least three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value. Our primary independent pricing service provides prices based on observable trades and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar “to-be-issued” securities. The prices obtained from its primary independent pricing service are compared to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. We do not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in a material difference in the recorded amounts. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we did not adjust prices received from the primary independent third-party pricing service.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe consolidated financial statements of Schwab have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Item 8 – Note 2 contains more information on our significant accounting policies made in connection with its application of these accounting principles.While the majority of the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on Schwab’s financial position and reported financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy.Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Additionally, management has reviewed with the Audit Committee the Company’s significant estimates discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.- 45 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Income TaxesSchwab estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, including federal, state and local domestic jurisdictions, and immaterial amounts owed to several foreign jurisdictions. The estimated income tax expense is reported in the consolidated statements of income in Taxes on income. Accrued taxes are reported in Other assets or Accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to future periods. Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. In estimating accrued taxes, we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position. Because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations, interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances. Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be significant to the operating results of the Company. See Item 8 – Note 19 for more information on the Company’s income taxes.Legal and Regulatory ReservesReserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, insurance coverage and indemnification, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved. See Item 8 – Note 13 for more information on the Company’s contingencies related to legal and regulatory reserves.- 46 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONItem 7A.

Deterioration in the housing and credit markets, reduction in short-term interest rates, and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact our results of operations and capital resources.Extensive regulation of our businesses may subject us to significant penalties or limitations on business activities.As a participant in the securities, banking, and financial services industries, we are subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws by governmental agencies, supervisory authorities and SROs. The costs and uncertainty related to complying with such regulations continue to increase. These regulations affect our business operations and impose capital, client protection, and market conduct requirements on us.In addition to specific banking laws and regulations, our banking regulators have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies and could require CSC and/or our banking subsidiaries to hold more capital, increase liquidity, or limit their ability to pay dividends or CSC’s ability to repurchase or redeem shares. The banking regulators could also limit our ability to grow, including adding assets, launching new products, making acquisitions, and undertaking strategic investments. Other potential regulatory actions include limiting our banking subsidiaries’ ability to accept deposits swept from client brokerage accounts and brokered deposits and preventing us from pursuing our business strategy.Despite our efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements, there are a number of risks, particularly in areas where applicable laws or regulations may be unclear or where regulators could revise their previous guidance. Any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by our regulators against us or our affiliates, officers or employees could result in fines, penalties, cease and desist orders, enforcement actions, suspension, disqualification or expulsion, or other disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on our business activities, any of which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.While we maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, violations could occur. In addition, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time. There may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance, including restrictions on certain activities. Such a finding may also damage our reputation and our relationships with our regulators and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities.- 9 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONLegislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively affect our business and financial results.New legislation, rules, regulations and guidance, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal, state, foreign and SRO rules, regulations and guidance, including changes relating to mutual funds, broker-dealer fiduciary duties and regulatory treatment of deposit accounts, may directly affect the operation and profitability of Schwab or its specific business lines. Our profitability could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes to the laws governing taxation, electronic commerce, client privacy and security of client data. In addition, the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business we conduct, modifications to our business practices, more stringent capital and liquidity requirements, increased deposit insurance assessments or additional costs and could limit our ability to return capital to stockholders. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to our compliance, risk management, treasury and operations functions.Failure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect our financial condition.CSC, together with its banking and broker-dealer subsidiaries, must meet certain capital and liquidity standards, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about the adequacy of Schwab’s capital and Schwab’s internal assessment of its capital needs. The Uniform Net Capital Rule limits CS&Co’s ability to transfer capital to CSC and other affiliates. New regulatory capital, liquidity, and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including paying dividends, stock repurchases, and redemptions, and may require us to increase our capital and/or liquidity or to limit our growth. Failure by either CSC or its banking subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a negative impact on us. In addition, failure by CSC or our banking subsidiaries to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to satisfy their capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer requirements would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital, replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as Tier 1 Capital, or increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity, could require us to liquidate assets, deleverage or otherwise change our business and/or investment plans, which may adversely affect our financial results. Issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders.In 2018, we crossed the threshold for becoming subject to the “advanced approaches” framework. We are currently subject to a supplementary leverage ratio and related disclosure requirements, the inclusion of AOCI in regulatory capital, and the countercyclical capital buffer, and will become subject to the full LCR in the second quarter of 2019. In addition, federal banking agencies have broad discretion and could require CSC or its banking subsidiaries to hold higher levels of capital or increase liquidity above the applicable regulatory requirements.Significant interest rate changes could affect our profitability.The direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings. A decline in interest rates may have a negative impact on our net interest revenue. A low interest rate environment may also have a negative impact on our asset management and administration fee revenues if we have to waive a portion of our management fees for certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds in order to continue providing a positive return to clients.Although we believe we are positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment, a rise in interest rates may cause our funding costs to increase if market conditions or the competitive environment induces us to raise our interest rates to avoid losing deposits, or replace deposits with higher cost funding sources without offsetting increases in yields on interest-earning assets can reduce our net interest revenue.The expected phase-out of LIBOR could negatively impact our net interest revenue and require significant operational work.Certain securities in our investment portfolio and the floating rate loans we offer reference LIBOR as the benchmark rate to determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount. We also use LIBOR in many of our financial models, such as those used for capital stress testing, and to determine the dividend rates for certain of our series of preferred stock which begin to float in 2022 and later. If LIBOR is discontinued after 2021 as expected, there will be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments and - 10 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONthere will be significant work required to transition to using the new benchmark rates and implement necessary changes to our systems and financial models. This could result in different financial performance for previously booked transactions and may impact our existing transaction data, products, systems, operations, and pricing processes. The calculation of interest rates under the replacement benchmarks could also impact our net interest revenue. In addition, LIBOR may perform differently during the phase-out period than in the past which could result in lower interest payments and a reduction in the value of certain securities in our investment portfolio.A significant change in client cash allocations could negatively impact our net interest revenue.We rely heavily on bank deposits as a low cost source of funding to extend loans to clients and purchase investment securities. Our bank deposits are primarily driven by our bank sweep feature when cash awaiting investment in our client brokerage accounts is swept to our banking subsidiaries. A significant reduction in our clients’ allocation to cash, a change in the allocation of that cash, or a transfer of cash away from the Company, could reduce net interest revenue. Security breaches of our systems, or those of our clients or third parties, may subject us to significant liability and damage Schwab’s reputation. Our business involves the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential information about our clients and us. Information security risks for financial institutions are increasing, in part because of the use of the internet and mobile technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, activists, hackers and other external parties, including foreign state actors. Our systems and those of other financial institutions have been and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, for example, employee misconduct.Given the high volume of transactions that we process, the large number of clients, counterparties and third-party service providers with which we do business and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks, a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected. The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before an investigation is completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known. During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.Security breaches, including breaches of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers or clients, could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject us to significant liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance, actions by our regulators, damage to Schwab’s reputation, or a loss of confidence in our security measures which could harm our business. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures.We also face risk related to external fraud involving the misappropriation and use of clients’ user names, passwords or other personal information to gain access to clients’ financial accounts at Schwab. This could occur from the compromise of clients’ personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company where clients’ personal information is taken and then made available to fraudsters. Such risk has grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties, including foreign state-sponsored parties. Losses reimbursed to clients under our guarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Technology and operational failures or errors could subject us to losses, litigation, regulatory actions, and reputational damage.We must process, record and monitor a large number of transactions and our operations are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology systems and our ability to make timely enhancements and additions to our systems. System interruptions, - 11 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONerrors or downtime can result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to our systems, linkages with third-party systems and power failures and can have a significant impact on our business and operations. Our systems are vulnerable to disruptions from human error, execution errors, errors in models such as those used for asset management, capital planning and management, risk management, stress testing and compliance, employee misconduct, unauthorized trading, external fraud, computer viruses, distributed denial of service attacks, cyber attacks, terrorist attacks, natural disaster, power outage, capacity constraints, software flaws, events impacting key business partners and vendors, and similar events. For example, Schwab and other financial institutions have been the target of various denial of service attacks that have, in certain circumstances, made websites, mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time. It could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to our technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen occurrence, which could affect our ability to process and settle client transactions. Moreover, instances of fraud or other misconduct might also negatively impact Schwab’s reputation and client confidence in the Company, in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk, oversee operational areas involving risk, and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer unexpected losses, reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors, including those of our vendors or other third parties.While we devote substantial attention and resources to the reliability, capacity and scalability of our systems, extraordinary trading volumes could cause our computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail, affecting our ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients’ orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate. Disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses and decreased client satisfaction. We are also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges, clearing houses and other intermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement. System failures and constraints and transaction errors at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices, cause substantial losses for us and for our clients, and subject us to claims from our clients for damages. Our investment management operations may subject us to fiduciary or other legal liability for client losses.Fund and trust management and administration are complex activities and include functions such as recordkeeping and accounting, security pricing, corporate actions, compliance with investment restrictions, daily net asset value computations, account reconciliations, and required distributions to fund shareholders. Failure to properly perform operational tasks, or the misrepresentation of our services and products could subject us to regulatory sanctions, penalties or litigation and result in reputational damage, liability to clients, and the termination of investment management or administration agreements and the withdrawal of assets under our management.In the management and administration of funds and client accounts, we use quantitative models and other tools and resources to support investment decisions and processes, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, trading and hedging activities and product valuations. Errors in the design, function, or underlying assumptions used in these models and tools, particularly if we fail to detect the errors over an extended period, could subject us to claims of a breach of fiduciary duty and potentially large liabilities for make-whole payments, litigation, and/or regulatory fines.A significant decrease in our liquidity could negatively affect our business as well as reduce client confidence in Schwab.Maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to our business operations, including transaction settlement, custody requirements, and lending commitments, among other liquidity needs. We meet our liquidity needs primarily from working capital and cash generated by client activity, as well as external financing. Fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances, as well as market conditions or changes in regulatory treatment of client deposits, may affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs. A reduction in our liquidity position could reduce client confidence in Schwab, which could result in the transfer of client assets and accounts, or could cause us to fail to satisfy our liquidity requirements, including the LCR. In addition, if our broker-dealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines, regulators could limit the subsidiaries’ operations or their ability to upstream funds to CSC, which could reduce CSC’s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt, pay dividends on CSC’s preferred stock, or return capital to common stockholders. In addition, CSC may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries.Factors which may adversely affect our liquidity position include CS&Co having temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances, fluctuations in cash - 12 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONheld in banking or brokerage client accounts, a dramatic increase in our lending activities (including margin, mortgage-related, and personal lending), increased capital requirements, changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations, other regulatory changes, or a loss of market or client confidence in Schwab resulting in unanticipated withdrawals of client funds.When available cash is not sufficient for our liquidity needs, we may seek external financing. During periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets, potential sources of external financing could be reduced, and borrowing costs could increase. Although CSC and CS&Co maintain committed and uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines and CSC has a commercial paper issuance program, as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC which can be used to sell securities, financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets. In addition, a significant downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets.We may suffer significant losses from our credit exposures.Our businesses are subject to the risk that a client, counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations, or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate. While we have policies and procedures designed to manage this risk, the policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Our exposure mainly results from margin lending, clients’ options and futures trading, securities lending, mortgage lending, pledged asset lending, our role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities, and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds we sponsor.When clients purchase securities on margin, borrow on lines of credit collateralized by securities, or trade options or futures, we are subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their accounts falls below the amount of clients’ indebtedness. Abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses.We have exposure to credit risk associated with our investments. Those investments are subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the financial market’s assessment of credit quality. Loss of value of securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such securities are other than temporarily impaired. The evaluation of whether other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) exists is a matter of judgment, which includes the assessment of several factors. If management determines that a security is OTTI, the cost basis of the security may be adjusted and a corresponding loss may be recognized in current earnings. Deterioration in the performance of available for sale (AFS) and held to maturity (HTM) securities could result in the recognition of future impairment charges. Even if a security is not considered OTTI, if we were ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity needs, we would have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time. Our bank loans primarily consist of First Mortgages, HELOCs, and PALs. Increases in delinquency and default rates, housing and stock price declines, increases in the unemployment rate, and other economic factors can result in charges for loan loss reserves and write downs on such loans.Heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments can increase our risk of loss. Examples include:•Large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry;•Mortgage loans and HELOCs to banking clients which are secured by properties in the same geographic region; and•Client margins, options or futures, pledged assets, and securities lending activities collateralized by or linked to securities of a single issuer, index, or industry.We sponsor a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds. Although we have no obligation to do so, we may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit, liquidity or other support to our funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity. Such support could cause us to take significant charges, could reduce our liquidity and, in certain situations, could, with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds, result in us having to consolidate one or more - 13 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONfunds in our financial statements. If we choose not to provide credit, liquidity or other support in such a situation, Schwab could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected.We are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending against claims or proceedings.The financial services industry faces significant litigation and regulatory risks. We are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages. We are also the subject of inquiries, investigations, and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies.Litigation and arbitration claims include those brought by our clients and the clients of third party advisors whose assets are custodied at Schwab. Claims from clients of third party advisors may allege losses due to investment decisions made by the third party advisors or the advisors’ misconduct. Litigation claims also include claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights (e.g., patents). Such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources. If we were found to have infringed on a third-party patent, or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial damages, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology, or providing certain products or services.Actions brought against us may result in settlements, awards, injunctions, fines, penalties or other results adverse to us, including reputational harm. Even if we are successful in defending against these actions, the defense of such matters may result in us incurring significant expenses. A substantial judgment, settlement, fine, or penalty could be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular future period, depending on our results for that period. In market downturns and periods of heightened volatility, the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased. We rely on outsourced service providers to perform key functions.We rely on external service providers to perform certain key technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. These service providers face technology, operating, business, and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee, or company information, could cause us to incur losses and could harm Schwab’s reputation. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider as a result of systems failures, capacity constraints, financial difficulties or for any other reason, and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services, and result in financial losses to us. Switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations. Potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on our financial position.We evaluate potential strategic transactions, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions. Any such transaction could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The process of evaluating, negotiating, and effecting any such strategic transaction may divert management’s attention from other business concerns, and might cause the loss of key clients, employees, and business partners. Moreover, integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties, including the need to integrate operational, financial, and management information systems and management controls, integrate relationships with clients and business partners, and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas. In addition, an acquisition may cause us to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings. Further, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition, and any future acquisition could be dilutive to our current stockholders’ percentage ownership or to earnings per common share (EPS).Our acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in the business, operations or financial condition of the entity being acquired or sold. To the extent we enter into an agreement to buy or sell an entity, there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected, or at all. If a material transaction does not close, our stock price could decline.- 14 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONOur industry is characterized by aggressive price competition.We continually monitor our pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjust trade commission rates, interest rates on deposits and loans, fees for advisory services, expense ratios on mutual funds and ETFs, and other pricing to enhance our competitive position. Increased price competition from other financial services firms to attract clients, such as reduced commissions, higher deposit rates, or reduced mutual fund or ETF expense ratios, could impact our results of operations and financial condition.We face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees.The market for qualified personnel in our business is highly competitive. At various times, different functions and roles are in especially high demand in the market, compelling us to pay more to attract talent. Our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs.Our stock price has fluctuated historically, and may continue to fluctuate.Our stock price can be volatile. Among the factors that may affect the volatility of our stock price are the following:•Our exposure to changes in interest rates;•Speculation in the investment community or the press about, or actual changes in, our competitive position, organizational structure, executive team, operations, financial condition, financial reporting and results, expense discipline, or strategic transactions;•The announcement of new products, services, acquisitions, or dispositions by us or our competitors; and•Increases or decreases in revenue or earnings, changes in earnings estimates by the investment community, and variations between estimated financial results and actual financial results.Changes in the stock market generally, or as it concerns our industry, as well as geopolitical, corporate, regulatory, business, and economic factors may also affect our stock price.Future sales of CSC’s equity securities may adversely affect the market price of CSC’s common stock and result in dilution.CSC’s certificate of incorporation authorizes CSC’s Board of Directors, among other things, to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities, without stockholder approval.CSC may issue additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital or for other purposes. The issuance of any additional equity or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of CSC’s common stock and may adversely affect the market price of CSC’s common stock.Item 1B.

We believe that metrics relating to net new and total client assets, as well as client cash levels and utilization of advisory services, offer perspective on our business momentum and client engagement. Data on new and total client brokerage accounts provides additional perspective on our ability to attract and retain new business. Total net revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin, EPS, return on average common stockholders’ equity, and the Consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio provide broad indicators of Schwab’s overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns. Total expenses, excluding interest, as a percentage of average client assets, is a measure of operating efficiency. Results for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 are as follows: Growth Rate 1-Year 2017-2018 2018 2017 2016Client Metrics Net new client assets (in billions) (1)(43)% $133.9 $233.1 $125.5Core net new client assets (in billions)15% $227.8 $198.6 $125.5Client assets (in billions, at year end)(3)% $3,252.2 $3,361.8 $2,779.5Average client assets (in billions)11% $3,409.6 $3,060.2 $2,614.7New brokerage accounts (in thousands)9% 1,576 1,441 1,093Active brokerage accounts (in thousands, at year end)8% 11,593 10,755 10,155Assets receiving ongoing advisory services (in billions, at year end)1% $1,708.5 $1,699.8 $1,401.4Client cash as a percentage of client assets (at year end) 12.8% 10.8% 13.0%Company Financial Metrics Total net revenues18% $10,132 $8,618 $7,478Total expenses excluding interest12% 5,570 4,968 4,485Income before taxes on income25% 4,562 3,650 2,993Taxes on income(19)% 1,055 1,296 1,104Net income49% $3,507 $2,354 $1,889Preferred stock dividends and other2% 178 174 143Net income available to common stockholders53% $3,329 $2,180 $1,746Earnings per common share — diluted52% $2.45 $1.61 $1.31Net revenue growth from prior year 18% 15% 17%Pre-tax profit margin 45.0% 42.4% 40.0%Return on average common stockholders’ equity 19% 15% 14%Expenses excluding interest as a percentage of average client assets 0.16% 0.16% 0.17%Consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio (at year end) 7.1% 7.6% 7.2%(1) 2018 includes outflows of $93.9 billion from certain mutual fund clearing services clients. 2017 includes inflows of $34.5 billion from certain mutual fund clearing services clients. 2018 Compared to 2017 Net income increased by $1.2 billion, or 49%, in 2018, driven primarily by business momentum, a supportive economic environment for much of the year, and lower corporate tax rates. Continued execution of our ‘Through Clients’ Eyes’ strategy helped us succeed with clients. In 2018, clients opened 1.6 million new brokerage accounts, helping bring active brokerage accounts to 11.6 million at the end of the year, and core net new assets totaled $227.8 billion, up 15% from the 2017 total. Our strong net new assets largely offset lower market valuations, and we ended 2018 at $3.25 trillion in total client assets.Total net revenue grew by $1.5 billion, or 18%, in 2018 primarily due to an increase of $1.5 billion, or 36%, in net interest revenue. The Fed raised the overnight federal funds target interest rate four times in 2018 for a total of 100 basis points. The growth of total net revenue resulted from higher interest rates due to the Fed’s rate normalization, and also from higher - 25 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)interest-earning assets, which reflect both client cash allocations and the transfer of sweep money market funds to bank and broker-dealer sweep. As we progressed with these transfers, the corresponding money market fund asset management and administration fee revenue naturally declined, yet positive inflows in advice solutions, Schwab equity and bond funds and ETFs, and other third-party mutual funds and ETFs kept asset management fees at $3.2 billion, limiting the decrease to 5% from 2017. Record trading activity from our clients resulted in trading revenue reaching $763 million, an increase of 17% from the prior year.Our increase in total expenses excluding interest of $602 million, or 12%, reflected our 2018 investments to support and fuel our business growth, including hiring additional client-facing and other employees and technology project spending, as well as an increase in marketing and a special stock award of $36 million to our employees. Even with these increases, expenses as a percentage of client assets remained consistent at 16 basis points, and pre-tax income increased 25% to $4.6 billion in 2018, resulting in a pre-tax profit margin of 45.0%. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act), taxes on income decreased 19% in 2018, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.1%. Overall, we generated a 19% return on equity and diluted EPS of $2.45 for the year.During 2018, the Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend 63% to $0.13 per share and authorized a $1.0 billion Share Repurchase Program, which we completed during the fourth quarter. These actions reflected the Company’s strong financial performance and our confidence in its long-term success; they also demonstrated that effective capital management at Schwab can support both healthy business growth and more meaningful capital returns to stockholders. 2017 Compared to 2016 Net income available to common stockholders rose in 2017 by $434 million, or 25%, from the prior year, resulting in diluted EPS of $1.61 in 2017 – an increase of 23% compared to $1.31 in 2016. Net revenues improved by $1.1 billion, or 15%, while expenses excluding interest increased $483 million, or 11%, compared to 2016.Our steady focus on operating ‘through clients’ eyes’ and our goal to continually challenge the status quo helped Schwab achieve another strong growth year in 2017. Clients opened 1.4 million new brokerage accounts in 2017 and trusted Schwab with $198.6 billion of core net new assets in 2017, up 58% from 2016. Total assets receiving ongoing advisory services grew 21% in 2017 to $1.70 trillion. Our success with clients was bolstered by strength in the equity markets – the Standard & Poor’s 500® Index (S&P 500) finished 2017 up 19% from the prior year end. Also in 2017, the Federal Reserve increased the overnight federal funds target interest rate three times for a total of 75 basis points. Strong client activity and the positive economic environment resulted in total client assets rising to $3.36 trillion as of December 31, 2017 – a 21% increase since the end of 2016.Schwab’s 2017 financial results demonstrate the power of our financial formula working as designed: our robust business growth supported strong revenue growth through multiple sources in 2017, which we combined with continued expense discipline to drive significantly improved profitability.Net revenues grew by 15% in 2017 compared to 2016 through contributions from our two largest revenue sources. Net interest revenue rose 29% while asset management and administration fees grew 11% in 2017 when compared to the prior year. Trading revenue declined in 2017 by 21% due to price reductions announced early in 2017. Consistent with our expectations, expenses grew 11% in 2017 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation and higher staffing related to our strong asset gathering, as well as expenses related to project spending and third-party fees tied to higher balances in our asset management business. This combination of revenue growth and expense discipline drove the pre-tax profit margin to 42.4% – an increase of 240 basis points over the prior year. Earnings before income taxes rose 22% to $3.7 billion in 2017 compared to $3.0 billion in the prior year. The effective tax rate in 2017 was 35.5% compared to 36.9% in 2016 reflecting the benefit from the adoption of new accounting standards requiring the recognition of a portion of tax deductions related to equity compensation partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and other tax adjustments associated with the 2017 enactment of the Tax Act.- 26 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Subsequent EventOn January 30, 2019, CSC publicly announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new Share Repurchase Program to repurchase up to $4.0 billion of common stock, and declared a four cent, or 31%, increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.17 per common share. The share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date. Current Regulatory Environment and Other DevelopmentsOn October 31, 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a notice of proposed rulemaking and the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC jointly issued another notice of proposed rulemaking. The two proposals would establish a revised framework for applying enhanced prudential standards to large U.S. banking organizations, with four categories of standards that reflect the risks of banking organizations in each group. CSC would be in Category III based on having $250 billion – $700 billion in total assets.The Federal Reserve proposal, which would make large savings and loan holding companies such as CSC subject to enhanced prudential standards, would tailor those regulatory requirements relating to capital stress testing, risk management, liquidity risk management, and single-counterparty credit limits based on the category of the banking organization. The proposal provides that Category III banking organizations would be subject to annual supervisory stress testing and biennial company-run stress testing. The interagency proposal would similarly tailor requirements under the agencies’ capital rule, LCR rule, and the proposed net stable funding ratio rule for banking organizations in each category. Under the proposal, banking organizations in Category III would not be required to calculate their risk-weighted assets using the “advanced approaches” framework or to include AOCI in calculating their regulatory capital; however, they would continue to be subject to the supplementary leverage ratio and any future countercyclical capital buffer imposed by the banking agencies.Although the Federal Reserve announced in its proposal that additional capital planning and resolution planning proposals would be issued at a later date, the agency did indicate that all Category III firms, including savings and loan holding companies, would be required to submit annual capital plans that would be subject to qualitative and quantitative assessments evaluated as part of the CCAR process.The comment period for both proposed rules ended on January 22, 2019 and the impact to Schwab cannot be assessed until the final rule is released.On December 22, 2017, P.L.115-97, the Tax Act, was signed into law, and became effective on January 1, 2018. Among other things, the Tax Act lowered the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate, generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP) require companies to remeasure their deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of the date of enactment, with the resulting tax effects accounted for in the reporting period of enactment. Schwab recorded a one-time non-cash charge to taxes on income associated with the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and other tax adjustments related to the tax reform legislation in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our 2018 effective income tax rate was reduced as a result of these changes. In May 2016, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC jointly issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would impose a minimum NSFR on certain banking organizations, including CSC. The comment period for the proposed rule ended on August 5, 2016 and the impact to the Company cannot be assessed until the final rule is released.- 27 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)RESULTS OF OPERATIONSTotal Net RevenuesTotal net revenues of $10.1 billion and $8.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, represented growth of 18% and 15% from the prior periods, primarily due to increases in net interest revenue.Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Growth Rate2017-2018 Amount% ofTotal NetRevenues Amount% ofTotal NetRevenues Amount% ofTotal NetRevenuesNet interest revenue Interest revenue44% $6,68066% $4,62454% $3,49346%Interest expense151% (857)(9)% (342)(4)% (171)(2)%Net interest revenue36% 5,82357% 4,28250% 3,32244%Asset management and administration fees Mutual fund and ETF service fees(12)% 1,79318% 2,04524% 1,85325%Advice solutions9% 1,13911% 1,04312% 91512%Other(2)% 2973% 3043% 2874%Asset management and administration fees(5)% 3,22932% 3,39239% 3,05541%Trading revenue Commissions14% 6857% 6007% 77910%Principal transactions44% 781% 541% 461%Trading revenue17% 7638% 6548% 82511%Other9% 3173% 2903% 2764%Total net revenues18% $10,132100% $8,618100% $7,478100%Net Interest RevenueSchwab’s primary interest-earning assets include cash and cash equivalents; cash and investments segregated; margin loans, which constitute the majority of receivables from brokerage clients; investment securities; and bank loans. Revenue on interest-earning assets is affected by various factors, such as the composition of assets, prevailing interest rates at the time of origination or purchase, changes in interest rates on floating rate securities and loans, and changes in prepayment levels for mortgage-related securities and loans. Fees earned on securities borrowing and lending activities, which are conducted by CS&Co using assets held in client brokerage accounts, are included in other interest revenue and expense.Schwab’s interest-bearing liabilities include bank deposits, payables to brokerage clients, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt. We establish the rates paid on client-related liabilities, and management expects that it will generally adjust the rates paid on these liabilities at some fraction of any movement in short-term rates. During 2018, these liabilities rose by a total of $63.3 billion, largely reflecting the effect of: our transferring a total of $72 billion sweep money market funds to bank and broker-dealer sweep; clients choosing to reallocate assets between cash, equities, fixed income and other investments; and the Company gathering additional flows from new and current clients. Overall, management believes that the extended period of extraordinarily low interest rates running from the financial crisis until recently has likely resulted in certain sweep cash balances retaining some level of latent rate sensitivity. With the Federal Funds Target Rate having increased to 2.25 – 2.50%, management expects some sweep cash balances could migrate to alternatives, including purchased money market funds, that offer higher yields to clients but lower revenue to Schwab. Given the general stability and relatively low rate sensitivity of client-related liabilities, management believes their duration is at least several years. We have positioned Schwab to benefit from an increase in interest rates, especially short-term interest rates, by managing the duration of interest-earning assets to be shorter than that of interest-bearing liabilities, so that asset yields are expected to move faster than liability costs.- 28 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)In order to keep interest-rate sensitivity within established limits, management monitors and responds to changes in the balance sheet. As Schwab builds its client base, we attract new client sweep cash, which, along with the transfers of existing sweep cash balances from money market funds, is a primary driver of balance sheet growth. By managing the duration of interest-earning assets as necessary, we are positioned to continue to gain from increasing rates while limiting exposure to falling rates to an acceptable level. Approximately half of our interest earning assets re-price or reset based on short-term interest rates such as one-month LIBOR. Non-interest-bearing funding sources include certain cash balances, stockholders’ equity and other miscellaneous assets and liabilities.The following table presents net interest revenue information corresponding to interest-earning assets and funding sources on the consolidated balance sheets:Year Ended December 31,2018 2017 2016 AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense Average Yield/Rate AverageBalance Interest Revenue/Expense Average Yield/Rate AverageBalance Interest Revenue/Expense Average Yield/RateInterest-earning assets Cash and cash equivalents$17,783 $348 1.93% $9,931 $109 1.10% $11,143 $57 0.51%Cash and investments segregated11,461 206 1.78% 18,525 166 0.90% 20,104 93 0.46%Broker-related receivables303 6 2.09% 430 3 0.70% 558 1 0.22%Receivables from brokerage clients19,870 830 4.12% 16,269 575 3.53% 15,001 497 3.31%Available for sale securities (1)54,542 1,241 2.26% 53,040 815 1.54% 72,586 883 1.22%Held to maturity securities131,794 3,348 2.53% 103,599 2,354 2.27% 57,451 1,402 2.44%Bank loans16,554 559 3.37% 15,919 472 2.97% 14,715 400 2.72%Total interest-earning assets252,307 6,538 2.57% 217,713 4,494 2.06% 191,558 3,333 1.74%Other interest revenue 142 130 160 Total interest-earning assets$252,307 $6,680 2.63% $217,713 $4,624 2.12% $191,558 $3,493 1.82%Funding sources Bank deposits$199,139 $545 0.27% $163,998 $148 0.09% $141,432 $37 0.03%Payables to brokerage clients21,178 56 0.27% 25,403 16 0.06% 26,311 3 0.01%Short-term borrowings3,359 54 1.59% 3,503 41 1.17% 1,864 9 0.48%Long-term debt5,423 190 3.50% 3,431 119 3.47% 2,876 104 3.62%Total interest-bearing liabilities229,099 845 0.37% 196,335 324 0.17% 172,483 153 0.09%Non-interest-bearing funding sources23,208 21,378 19,075 Other interest expense 12 18 18 Total funding sources$252,307 $857 0.34% $217,713 $342 0.15% $191,558 $171 0.09%Net interest revenue $5,823 2.29% $4,282 1.97% $3,322 1.73%(1) Amounts have been calculated based on amortized cost.Net interest revenue increased $1.5 billion or 36%, in 2018 from 2017, and $960 million, or 29%, in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to higher interest rates and growth in interest-earning assets. Our net interest margin improved 32 basis points to 2.29% in 2018, primarily as a result of the Federal Reserve’s 2017 and 2018 interest rate increases, partially offset by higher interest rates paid on bank deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. Our net interest margin was 1.97% in 2017, representing an improvement of 24 basis points compared to 2016, primarily due to the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases in 2016 and 2017. Average interest earning assets grew 16% and 14% during 2018 and 2017, respectively, compared with the sequential prior years. These increases primarily reflect higher bank deposits due to transfers from sweep money market funds to bank sweep balances, as well as changes in client cash allocations, partially offset by client purchases of other assets. In March 2017, $24.7 billion of debt securities were transferred from the AFS category to the HTM category. The transfer had no effect on the overall net interest margin. For additional information on the transfer, see Item 8 – Note 6.- 29 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Asset Management and Administration FeesAsset management and administration fees include mutual fund and ETF service fees and fees for other asset-based financial services provided to individual and institutional clients. Schwab earns mutual fund and ETF service fees for shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. Asset management and administration fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in these funds and do not include securities lending revenues earned by proprietary mutual funds and ETFs, as those amounts, net of program fees, are credited to the fund shareholders. The fair values of client assets included in proprietary and third-party mutual funds and ETFs are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data.We also earn asset management fees for advice solutions, which include managed portfolios, specialized strategies, and customized investment advice. Other asset management and administration fees include various asset-based fees such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, mutual fund clearing fees, collective trust fund fees, and non-balance based service and transaction fees.Asset management and administration fees vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity.

Prior periods have been adjusted to accommodate this change.(3) Includes various asset-related fees, such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, and mutual fund clearing fees and other service fees. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, a prospective methodology change was made to average client assets relating to 401(k) recordkeeping fees to provide improved insight into the associated fee driver, which resulted in an increase of approximately $25 billion. There was no impact to revenue or the average fee.(4) Includes miscellaneous service and transaction fees relating to mutual funds and ETFs that are not balance-based.Asset management and administration fees decreased by $163 million, or 5%, in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to lower money market fund revenue as a result of transfers to bank sweep, client asset allocation choices, and our 2017 fee reductions. Part of the decline was offset by revenue from growing asset balances in advice solutions, Schwab equity and bond funds and ETFs, and other third-party mutual funds and ETFs.- 30 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Asset management and administration fees increased by $337 million, or 11%, in 2017 from 2016 due to higher average client assets invested in advice solutions, mutual funds and ETFs, and lower fee waivers on money market funds. Partially offsetting these increases were lower fee rates on proprietary money funds and other indexed mutual funds and ETFs due to fee reductions implemented by Schwab in 2017.The following table presents a roll forward of client assets for the Schwab money market funds, Schwab equity and bond funds and ETFs, and Mutual Fund OneSource® and other non-transaction fee (NTF) funds. The following funds generated 47%, 53%, and 53% of the asset management and administration fees earned during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively: Schwab Money Schwab Equity and Mutual Fund OneSource® Market Funds Bond Funds and ETFs and Other NTF FundsYear Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016Balance at beginning of period $163,650 $163,495 $166,148 $181,608 $125,813 $102,112 $225,202 $198,924 $207,654Net inflows (outflows) (11,641) (486) (2,765) 31,091 30,771 13,858 (37,513) (27,485) (22,469)Net market gains (losses) and other (1) 1,463 641 112 (17,589) 25,024 9,843 (7,157) 53,763 13,739Balance at end of period $153,472 $163,650 $163,495 $195,110 $181,608 $125,813 $180,532 $225,202 $198,924(1) Includes net inflows from other third-party mutual funds to Mutual Fund OneSource® in the second quarter of 2017.Trading RevenueTrading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenue is affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. Principal transaction revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from trading activity in fixed income securities with clients. To accommodate clients’ fixed income trading activity, Schwab maintains positions in fixed income securities, including U.S. state and municipal debt obligations, U.S. Government and corporate debt, and other securities. The difference between the price at which the Company buys and sells securities to and from its clients and other broker-dealers is recognized as principal transaction revenue. Principal transaction revenue also includes adjustments to the fair value of these securities positions.The following table presents trading revenue and the related drivers:Year Ended December 31,Growth Rate2017-2018 2018 2017 2016DARTs (in thousands)31% 420.9 321.3 291.6Clients’ daily average trades (in thousands)26% 765.4 608.8 561.8Number of trading days— 249.5 250.0 251.5Daily average revenue per revenue trade(12)% $7.23 $8.20 $11.23Trading revenue17% $763 $654 $825Trading revenue increased by $109 million, or 17%, in 2018 compared to 2017. DART volumes increased 31% in 2018, which more than offset Schwab’s commission pricing reductions implemented in the first quarter of 2017. Trading revenue decreased by $171 million in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to lower commissions rates on DARTs. During the first quarter of 2017, we announced two trading price reductions which lowered standard equity, ETF, and option trade commissions from $8.95 to $4.95 and lowered the per contract option fee from $.75 to $.65. These reductions in commission rates reflect our continuing belief that pricing should never be an obstacle for choosing Schwab and our commitment to share the benefits of scale with clients. With these changes, trading revenue has declined from a peak of 50%-60% of total revenue in the early 1990’s to the current low of 8% in 2018, 8% in 2017, and 11% in 2016.Other RevenueOther revenue includes order flow revenue, other service fees, software fees from our portfolio management solutions, exchange processing fees, and non-recurring gains. Order flow revenue was $139 million during 2018, $114 million for 2017, and $103 million in 2016. These increases were primarily due to higher rebate rates received on certain types of - 31 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)orders and higher volume of trades. In 2016, other revenue also included net litigation proceeds of $16 million related to our non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities portfolios.Total Expenses Excluding InterestThe following table shows a comparison of total expenses excluding interest: Growth Rate 2017-2018 2018 2017 2016Compensation and benefits Salaries and wages13% $1,692 $1,496 $1,368Incentive compensation7% 855 797 689Employee benefits and other15% 510 444 409Total compensation and benefits12% $3,057 $2,737 $2,466Professional services13% 654 580 506Occupancy and equipment14% 496 436 398Advertising and market development17% 313 268 265Communications5% 242 231 237Depreciation and amortization14% 306 269 234Regulatory fees and assessments6% 189 179 144Other17% 313 268 235Total expenses excluding interest12% $5,570 $4,968 $4,485Expenses as a percentage of total net revenues Compensation and benefits 30% 32% 33%Advertising and market development 3% 3% 4%Full-time equivalent employees (in thousands) At year end11% 19.5 17.6 16.2Average11% 18.7 16.9 15.9໿Expenses excluding interest increased in 2018 and 2017 from the prior years by 12% and 11%, respectively. The largest drivers of the increase in both years were compensation and benefits and professional services. Total compensation and benefits increased in 2018 and 2017 from prior years, primarily due to increases in employee headcount to support our expanding client base. Additionally, in 2018 non-officer employees were issued special stock awards totaling $36 million.Professional services expense increased in 2018 and 2017 from the prior years, primarily due to higher spending on technology projects as well as an increase in asset management and administration related expenses resulting from growth in the Schwab Funds® and Schwab ETFs™. Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2018 and 2017 from the prior years, primarily due to an increase in software maintenance expenses and additional licenses to support growth in the business.Advertising and market development expense rose in 2018, primarily reflecting management’s decision to increase television advertising and digital media spending in the fourth quarter. Depreciation and amortization expenses grew in 2018 and 2017 from the prior years, primarily due to higher amortization of internally developed software associated with our investments in software and technology enhancements.- 32 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Regulatory fees assessments increased in 2018 and 2017 from the prior years, due to an increase in FDIC insurance assessments which rose as a result of higher average assets in deposit balances. This increase in 2018 was partially offset by the elimination of the FDIC surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018.Other expenses increased in 2018 from 2017 due to travel and entertainment and miscellaneous items due to overall growth in our business. Other expenses increased in 2017 from 2016 due to travel and entertainment, asset volume-related increases, and some miscellaneous items.Capital expenditures were $576 million, $412 million, and $353 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures in both 2018 and 2017 from the prior years was primarily due to the expansion of our campuses in the U.S. and investments in technology projects. The largest component of capital expenditures in 2018 was investment in buildings of $253 million. Capitalized costs for developing internal-use software totaled $167 million, $157 million, and $130 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Our capital expenditures for 2018 came in at the lower end of our estimated range of 6-7% of total net revenues, largely due to the timing of our campus expansion work. As we carry this work forward in 2019 and invest further in technology projects, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will reach approximately 7-9% of total net revenues. Our longer term expectation for capital expenditures remains in the range of 3-5% of total net revenues.Taxes on IncomeAs previously discussed under Current Regulatory Environment and Other Developments, the Tax Act was signed into law during 2017. Among other things, the Tax Act lowered the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, beginning in 2018. Also as a result of the Tax Act, Schwab recognized a $46 million one-time non-cash charge to taxes on income in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and other tax adjustments related to the Tax Act. Effective January 1, 2017, Schwab adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09, which prospectively changed the accounting treatment of a portion of the tax deductions relating to equity compensation. These deductions were previously reflected directly in additional paid-in capital, a component of stockholders’ equity, and are now included in taxes on income, a component of net income. As a result of this change, our tax expense was reduced by approximately $46 million and $87 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Future effects will depend on our share price, restricted stock vesting, and the volume of equity incentive options exercised.Schwab’s effective income tax rate on income before taxes was 23.1% in 2018, 35.5% in 2017, and 36.9% in 2016. The decrease in rates over this three-year time period was primarily due to the net impact of the above items. Segment InformationSchwab provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments – Investor Services and Advisor Services. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services, retirement plan services, and other corporate brokerage services to individual investors. The Advisor Services segment provides custodial, trading, banking, and support services as well as retirement business services to independent RIAs, independent retirement advisors and recordkeepers. Revenues and expenses are attributed to the two segments based on which segment services the client. Management evaluates the performance of the segments on a pre-tax basis. Segment assets and liabilities are not used for evaluating segment performance or in deciding how to allocate resources to segments. Net revenues in both segments are generated from the underlying client assets and trading activity; differences in the composition of net revenues between the segments are based on the composition of client assets, client trading frequency, and pricing unique to each. While both segments leverage the scale and efficiency of our platforms, segment expenses reflect the dynamics of serving millions of clients in Investor Services versus the thousands of RIAs on the advisor platform.- 33 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Financial information for our segments is presented in the following table: Investor Services Advisor Services Total Growth Rate2017-2018 2018 2017 2016 Growth Rate2017-2018 2018 2017 2016 Growth Rate2017-2018 2018 2017 2016Year Ended December 31, Net Revenues Net interest revenue 34% $4,341 $3,231 $2,591 41% $1,482 $1,051 $731 36% $5,823 $4,282 $3,322Asset management and administration fees (4)% 2,260 2,344 2,093 (8)% 969 1,048 962 (5)% 3,229 3,392 3,055Trading revenue 16% 475 408 524 17% 288 246 301 17% 763 654 825Other 13% 245 217 203 (1)% 72 73 73 9% 317 290 276Total net revenues 18% 7,321 6,200 5,411 16% 2,811 2,418 2,067 18% 10,132 8,618 7,478Expenses Excluding Interest 11% 4,145 3,725 3,380 15% 1,425 1,243 1,105 12% 5,570 4,968 4,485Income before taxes on income 28% $3,176 $2,475 $2,031 18% $1,386 $1,175 $962 25% $4,562 $3,650 $2,993Investor ServicesTotal net revenues increased by $1.1 billion, or 18%, in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to an increase in net interest revenue, partially offset by lower asset management and administration fees.

Total net revenues increased by $789 million, or 15%, in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees, partially offset by a decrease in trading revenue. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher net interest margins and higher balances of interest-earning assets. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to higher client assets enrolled in advisory solutions and higher net fees on money market fund assets. Trading revenue decreased primarily due to lower commission rates.

The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that Schwab will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks.Our risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting, and risk mitigation. The activities and governance that comprise the risk management process are described below.CultureThe Board of Directors has approved an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework that incorporates our purpose, vision, and values, which form the bedrock of our corporate culture and set the tone for the organization.We designed the ERM Framework to enable a comprehensive approach to managing risks encountered by Schwab in its business activities. The framework incorporates key concepts commensurate with the size, risk profile, complexity, and continuing growth of the Company. Risk appetite, which is defined as the amount of risk the Company is willing to accept in pursuit of its corporate strategy, is developed by executive management and approved by the Board of Directors.Risk GovernanceSenior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling risks. The Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior executives from each major business and control function, is responsible for the oversight of risk management. This includes identifying emerging risks, assessing risk management practices and the control environment, reinforcing business accountability for risk management, supervisory controls and regulatory compliance, supporting resource prioritization across the organization, and escalating significant issues to the Board of Directors.We have established risk metrics and reporting that enable measurement of the impact of strategy execution against risk appetite. The risk metrics, with risk limits and tolerance levels, are established for key risk categories by the Global Risk Committee and its functional risk sub-committees.The Chief Risk Officer regularly reports activities of the Global Risk Committee to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. The Board Risk Committee in turn assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to our risk management program, including approving risk appetite statements and related key risk appetite metrics and reviewing reports relating to risk issues from functional areas of risk management, legal, compliance, and internal audit.Functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report to the Global Risk Committee. These sub-committees include the:•Compliance Risk Committee – provides oversight of compliance risk management programs and policies providing an aggregate view of compliance risk exposure, and includes a subcommittee covering Fiduciary Risk;•Financial Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of and approves capital, credit, liquidity, and market risk policies, limits, and exposures;•New Products and Services Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of, and approves corporate policy and procedures relating to the risk governance of new products and services; and•Operational Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of and approves operational risk management policies, risk tolerance levels, and operational risk governance processes, and includes sub-committees covering Fraud, Data, Information Security, Model Governance, and Third-Party risk.- 35 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Senior management has also created an Incentive Compensation Risk Oversight Committee, which establishes policy and reviews and approves the Annual Risk Assessment of incentive compensation plans, and reports directly to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Company’s compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and corporate risk management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring risk management.In addition, the Disclosure Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.Operational RiskOperational risks arise due to potential inadequacies or failures related to people, internal processes, and systems, or from external events or relationships impacting the Company and/or any of its key business partners and third parties. While operational risk is inherent in all business activities, we rely on a system of internal controls and risk management practices designed to keep operational risk and operational losses within the Company’s risk appetite. We have specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and use periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. Where appropriate, we manage the impact of operational loss and litigation expense through the purchase of insurance. The insurance program is specifically designed to address our key operational risks and to maintain compliance with local laws and regulation.Schwab’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity and resilience of our critical business functions and technology systems. To the extent Schwab experiences business or system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, technological failure, cyber attacks, changes to systems, linkages with third-party systems, and power failures), our business and operations could be negatively impacted. To minimize business interruptions and ensure the capacity to continue operations during an incident regardless of duration, Schwab maintains a backup and recovery infrastructure which includes facilities for backup and communications, a geographically dispersed workforce, and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans and a well-established incident management program.Information Security risk is the risk of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, recording or destruction of the firm’s information or systems. We have designed and implemented an information security program that knits together complementary tools, controls and technologies to protect systems, client accounts and data. We continuously monitor the systems and work collaboratively with government agencies, law enforcement and other financial institutions to address potential threats. We use advanced monitoring systems to identify suspicious activity and deter unauthorized access by internal or external actors. We limit the number of employees who have access to clients’ personal information and internal authentication measures are enforced to protect against the potential for social engineering. All employees who handle sensitive information are trained in privacy and security. Schwab’s fraud and cyber security teams monitor activity looking for suspicious behavior. These capabilities allow us to identify and quickly act on any attempted intrusions.Schwab also faces operational risk when we employ the services of various third parties, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. We manage the exposure to third party risk and promote a culture of resiliency through contractual provisions, control standards, ongoing monitoring of third party performance, and appropriate testing. We maintain policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with all data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-public client information. We clearly define for employees, contractors, and third parties the expected standards of care for confidential data. We also provide regular training on data security.Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. Models are owned by several business units throughout the organization, and are used for a variety of purposes. Model use includes, but is not limited to, calculating capital requirements for hypothetical stressful environments, estimating interest and credit risk for loans and other balance sheet assets, and providing guidance in the management of client portfolios. We have established a policy to describe the roles and responsibilities of all key stakeholders in model development, management, and use. All models are registered in a centralized database and classified into different risk - 36 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)ratings depending on their potential financial, reputational, or regulatory impact to the Company. The model risk rating determines the scope of model governance activities.Compliance RiskSchwab faces compliance risk which is the potential exposure to legal or regulatory sanctions, fines or penalties, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, or other regulatory requirements. Among other things, compliance risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of our controls. The Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, including SROs. We manage compliance risk through policies, procedures and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, client privacy, and employment policies. Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. We manage this risk by establishing policy and procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the policy and procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees.Credit RiskCredit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform on its contractual obligations. Our exposure to credit risk mainly results from investing activities in our liquidity and investment portfolios, mortgage lending, margin lending and client option and futures activities, pledged asset lending, securities lending activities, and our role as a counterparty in other financial contracts. To manage the risks of such losses, we have established policies and procedures, which include establishing and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin, PAL, option, and futures requirements for certain securities and instruments. Liquidity and Investment PortfoliosSchwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios, which include U.S. agency, and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. state and municipal securities, commercial paper, and foreign government agency securities.At December 31, 2018, substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade. U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.Mortgage Lending PortfolioThe bank loan portfolio includes First Mortgages, HELOCs, and other loans. The credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual loan and portfolio reviews. Management regularly reviews asset quality, including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for loan losses.Our residential loan underwriting guidelines include maximum LTV ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan size is conforming or jumbo). - 37 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Schwab does not originate or purchase residential loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. For more information on credit quality indicators relating to Schwab’s bank loans, see Item 8 – Note 7. Securities and Instrument-Based Lending PortfoliosCollateral arrangements relating to margin loans, PALs, option and futures positions, securities lending agreements, and resale agreements include provisions that require additional collateral in the event of market fluctuations. Additionally, for margin loans, PALs, options and futures positions, and securities lending agreements, collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral sufficiently exceeds the credit exposure in order to maintain a fully secured position.Other Counterparty ExposuresSchwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab’s clients or a counterparty fail to meet their obligations to Schwab.Market RiskMarket risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by Schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, or market conditions. We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on our interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources that finance these assets. Net interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may reprice at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short and long-term interest rates. Interest-earning assets primarily include investment securities, margin loans and bank loans. These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment. Because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans, and control the composition of our investment securities, we have some ability to manage our net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions.To mitigate the risk of declining interest revenue, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk, and monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of our interest-earning assets and funding sources. To remain within these guidelines, we manage the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios.Financial instruments are also subject to the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument. We are indirectly exposed to option, futures, and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option and futures accounts, securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers, and client securities loaned out as part of the brokerage securities lending activities. Equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity, margin borrowing, and overall client engagement with Schwab. Additionally, we earn mutual fund and ETF service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets. Fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue we earn.Our market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material. Net Interest Revenue SimulationFor Schwab’s net interest revenue sensitivity analysis, we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulation includes all interest-sensitive assets and liabilities. Key variables in the simulation include the repricing of financial instruments, prepayment, reinvestment, and product pricing assumptions. The simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue. Actual results may differ from simulated results due - 38 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies, including changes in asset and liability mix.If our guidelines for net interest revenue sensitivity are breached, management must report the breach to the Financial Risk Oversight Committee and establish a plan to address the interest rate risk. There were no breaches of Schwab’s net interest revenue sensitivity risk limits during the years ended December 31, 2018 or 2017.As represented by the simulations presented below, our investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall.The simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheets would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As we actively manage the consolidated balance sheets and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment. The following table shows the simulated net interest revenue change over the next 12 months beginning December 31, 2018 and 2017 of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period.December 31,20182017Increase of 100 basis points4.4%3.3%Decrease of 100 basis points(4.9)%(6.2)%The year-over-year change in net interest revenue sensitivities reflects higher interest rates across the yield curve, and particularly, higher short-term interest rates.Liquidity RiskLiquidity risk is the potential that Schwab will be unable to meet cash flow obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses.Due to its role as a source of financial strength, CSC’s liquidity needs are primarily driven by the liquidity and capital needs of CS&Co, the capital needs of the banking subsidiaries, principal and interest due on corporate debt, dividend payments on CSC’s preferred stock, and returns of capital to common stockholders. The liquidity needs of CS&Co are primarily driven by client activity including trading and margin borrowing activities and capital expenditures. The capital needs of the banking subsidiaries are primarily driven by client deposits. We have established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies, while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions. We seek to maintain client confidence in the balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the Company to meet its obligations. To this end, we have established limits and contingency funding scenarios to support liquidity levels during both business as usual and stressed conditions.We employ a variety of methodologies to monitor and manage liquidity. We conduct regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific liquidity stress events. Liquidity is also tested at key subsidiaries and results are reported to the Financial Risk Oversight Committee. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the organization and are reviewed with management as appropriate.- 39 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)The Company was subject to, and was in compliance with, the modified LCR rule at December 31, 2018. As Schwab’s consolidated balance sheet assets were above $250 billion at December 31, 2018, Schwab will become subject to the full LCR rule in the second quarter of 2019. The table below presents information about our average LCR: Average for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2018Total eligible HQLA$38,881Net cash outflows (1)$35,191LCR111%(1) This amount represents modified net cash outflows as defined by the LCR rule, which requires that HQLA cover 70% of total stressed net cash outflows.Primary Funding SourcesSchwab’s primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity which includes bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts. These funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients. Other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, repayments on loans, securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts, repurchase agreements, and cash provided by external financing.To meet daily funding needs, we maintain liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments. For unanticipated liquidity needs, a buffer of highly liquid investments, currently comprised of U.S. Treasury notes, is also maintained.Additional Funding SourcesIn addition to internal sources of liquidity, Schwab has access to external funding. The need for short-term borrowings from these facilities arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest-earning investments, movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements and general corporate purposes. We maintain policies and procedures necessary to access funding and test discount window borrowing procedures on a periodic basis.The following table describes external debt facilities available at December 31, 2018:DescriptionBorrowerOutstandingAvailableFederal Home Loan Bank secured credit facility (1)Banking subsidiaries$—$35,528Uncommitted, unsecured lines of credit with various external banksCSC, CS&Co—1,432Unsecured commercial paper (2)CSC—750Committed, unsecured credit facility with various external banks (3)CSC—750Federal Reserve Bank discount window (4)CSB—7,865(1) Amounts available are dependent on the amount of First Mortgages, HELOCs, and the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral. (2) CSC has authorization from its Board of Directors to issue Commercial Paper Notes to not exceed $1.5 billion. Management has set a current limit not to exceed the amount of the committed, unsecured credit facility.(3) Other than an overnight borrowing to test availability, this facility was unused during 2018.(4) Amounts available are dependent on the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral. Certain banking subsidiaries maintain secured credit facilities with the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB). Amounts available under these facilities are dependent on the value of our First Mortgages, HELOCs, and the fair value of certain of our investment securities that are pledged as collateral. During 2018, CSB used borrowings under this agreement to purchase investment securities in advance of bank sweep transfers. This credit facility is also available as backup financing in the event the outflow of client cash from the banking subsidiaries’ respective balance sheets is greater than maturities and paydowns on investment securities and bank loans. - 40 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)CSB also has access to short-term secured funding through the Federal Reserve’s discount window. Amounts available under the Federal Reserve discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral. CSC has a commercial paper program of which proceeds are used for general corporate purposes. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes may vary, but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue. CSC’s ratings for these short-term borrowings are P1 by Moody’s, A1 by Standard & Poor’s, and F1 by Fitch. CSC had no Commercial Paper Notes outstanding at December 31, 2018 or 2017.The financial covenants for the $750 million committed credit facility require CS&Co to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, CSB to be well capitalized, and CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity, adjusted to exclude AOCI. At December 31, 2018, the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was $14.5 billion (CSC’s stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, at December 31, 2018 was $20.9 billion). Management believes these restrictions will not have a material effect on CSC’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements.To partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation, CS&Co has unsecured standby letter of credit agreements (LOCs) with several banks in favor of the Options Clearing Corporation aggregating $225 million at December 31, 2018. There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs during 2018 or 2017. In connection with its securities lending activities, the Company is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. The collateral requirements were satisfied by providing cash as collateral.CSC has a universal automatic shelf registration statement (Shelf Registration Statement) on file with the SEC, which enables it to issue debt, equity, and other securities.BorrowingsLong-term debt outstanding was $6.9 billion and $4.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. No short-term borrowings were outstanding as of December 31, 2018. Short-term borrowings outstanding from the FHLB were $15.0 billion at December 31, 2017.

These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, Schwab enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements in the ordinary course of business. For information on each of these arrangements, see Item 8 – Note 7, Note 11, Note 13, Note 14, and Note 15. Contractual ObligationsSchwab’s principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 are shown in the following table. Excluded from this table are liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets that are generally short-term in nature (e.g., payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations and short-term borrowings) or without contractual payment terms (e.g., bank deposits, payables to brokerage clients, and deferred compensation).December 31, 2018Less than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5Years More than5 Years TotalCredit-related financial instruments (1)$1,592 $3,162 $5,093 $1,698 $11,545Long-term debt (2)237 2,325 1,370 4,330 8,262Purchase obligations (3)475 303 54 170 1,002Leases (4)128 219 150 282 779Total$2,432 $6,009 $6,667 $6,480 $21,588(1) Represents CSB’s commitments to extend credit to banking clients, purchase mortgage loans, and commitments to fund CRA investments.(2) Includes estimated future interest payments through 2029 for Senior Notes.

Schwab’s primary sources of capital are funds generated by the operations of subsidiaries and securities issuances by CSC in the capital markets. To ensure that Schwab has sufficient capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values, we have adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios. - 42 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Internal guidelines are set, for both CSC and its regulated subsidiaries, to ensure capital levels are in line with our strategy and regulatory requirements. Capital forecasts are reviewed monthly at Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee and Financial Risk Oversight Committee meetings. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify potential problems that could impact capital. In addition, we monitor the subsidiaries’ capital levels and requirements. Subject to regulatory capital requirements and any required approvals, any excess capital held by subsidiaries is transferred to CSC in the form of dividends and returns of capital. When subsidiaries have need of additional capital, funds are provided by CSC as equity investments and also as subordinated loans (in a form approved as regulatory capital by regulators) for CS&Co. The details and method used for each cash infusion are based on an analysis of the particular entity’s needs and financing alternatives. The amounts and structure of infusions must take into consideration maintenance of regulatory capital requirements, debt/equity ratios, and equity double leverage ratios.Schwab conducts regular capital stress testing to assess the potential financial impacts of various adverse macroeconomic and company-specific events to which the Company could be subjected. The objective of the capital stress testing is (1) to explore various potential outcomes – including rare and extreme events and (2) to assess impacts of potential stressful outcomes on both capital and liquidity. Additionally, we have a comprehensive Capital Contingency Plan to provide action plans for certain low probability/high impact capital events that the Company might face. The Capital Contingency Plan is issued under the authority of the Financial Risk Oversight Committee and provides guidelines for sustained capital events. It does not specifically address every contingency, but is designed to provide a framework for responding to any capital stress. The results of the stress testing indicate there are two scenarios which could stress the Company’s capital: (1) inflows of balance sheet cash during a period of very low interest rates and (2) outflows of balance sheet cash when other sources of financing are not available and the Company is required to sell assets to fund the flows at a loss. The Capital Contingency Plan is reviewed annually and updated as appropriate.For additional information, see Business – Regulation in Part I, Item 1.Regulatory Capital RequirementsCSC is subject to capital requirements set by the Federal Reserve and is required to serve as a source of strength for our banking subsidiaries and to provide financial assistance if our banking subsidiaries experience financial distress. Schwab is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for CSC of at least 4%; however, management seeks to maintain the ratio of at least 6%. Due to the relatively low risk of our balance sheet assets and risk-based capital ratios at CSC and CSB that are well in excess of regulatory requirements, the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint on CSC’s asset growth.Our banking subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements set by their regulators that are substantially similar to those imposed on CSC by the Federal Reserve. Our banking subsidiaries’ failure to remain well capitalized could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that could have a direct material effect on the banks. Schwab’s principal banking subsidiary, CSB, is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of at least 5% to be well capitalized, but seeks to maintain the ratio of at least 6.25%. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2018, CSB is considered well capitalized.- 43 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)The following table details CSC’s consolidated and CSB’s capital ratios:December 31,2018 2017 CSC CSB CSC CSBTotal stockholders’ equity$20,670 $15,615 $18,525 $13,224Less: Preferred Stock2,793 — 2,793 —Common Equity Tier 1 Capital before regulatory adjustments$17,877 $15,615 $15,732 $13,224Less: Goodwill, net of associated deferred tax liabilities$1,188 $13 $1,191 $13Other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities125 — 61 —Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances and deferred tax liabilities3 1 2 —AOCI adjustment (1)(252) (231) (152) (144)Common Equity Tier 1 Capital $16,813 $15,832 $14,630 $13,355Tier 1 Capital$19,606 $15,832 $17,423 $13,355Total Capital19,628 15,853 17,452 13,382Risk-Weighted Assets95,441 80,513 75,866 66,519Common Equity Tier 1 Capital/Risk-Weighted Assets17.6% 19.7% 19.3% 20.1%Tier 1 Capital/Risk-Weighted Assets20.5% 19.7% 23.0% 20.1%Total Capital/Risk-Weighted Assets20.6% 19.7% 23.0% 20.1%Tier 1 Leverage Ratio7.1% 7.2% 7.6% 7.1%(1) CSC and CSB elected to opt-out of the requirement to include most components of AOCI in CET1 Capital. Beginning in 2019, CSC is required to include all components of AOCI in regulatory capital. CSB is also subject to regulatory requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions. In addition, CSB is required to provide notice to, and may be required to obtain approval from, the OCC and the Federal Reserve to declare dividends to CSC.As a broker-dealer, CS&Co is subject to regulatory requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule, which is intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit CS&Co from paying cash dividends, making unsecured advances and loans to the parent company and employees, and repaying subordinated borrowings from CSC if such payment would result in a net capital amount below prescribed thresholds. At December 31, 2018, CS&Co was in compliance with its net capital requirements.In addition to the capital requirements above, Schwab’s subsidiaries are subject to other regulatory requirements intended to ensure financial soundness and liquidity. See Item 8 – Note 21 for additional information on the components of stockholders’ equity and information on the capital requirements of significant subsidiaries.DividendsSince the initial dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 119 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend rate 23 times, resulting in a 21% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, CSC currently targets its common stock cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income.- 44 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)The Board of Directors of the Company declared quarterly cash dividend increases per common share during 2017 and 2018 as shown below: Quarterly Cash Increase New Quarterly DividendDate of DeclarationPer Common Share% IncreasePer Common ShareJanuary 26, 2017$0.0114%$0.08January 25, 20180.0225%0.10July 25, 20180.0330%0.13In addition, on January 30, 2019, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a four cent, or 31%, increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.17 per common share.

CSC repurchased 22 million shares of its common stock for $1.0 billion in 2018, completing all repurchases under this authorization. There were no repurchases of CSC’s common stock in 2018 prior to the fourth quarter, or in 2017. On January 30, 2019, CSC publicly announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $4.0 billion of common stock. The authorization does not have an expiration date.FOREIGN HOLDINGSAt December 31, 2018, Schwab had exposure to non-sovereign financial and non-financial institutions in foreign countries, as well as agencies of foreign governments. At December 31, 2018, the fair value of these holdings totaled $7.6 billion, with the top three exposures being to issuers and counterparties domiciled in France at $2.8 billion, Sweden at $1.3 billion, and Canada at $0.8 billion. In addition to the direct holdings in foreign companies and securities issued by foreign government agencies, Schwab has indirect exposure to foreign countries through its investments in CSIM money market funds (collectively, the Funds) resulting from brokerage clearing activities. At December 31, 2018, the Company had $21 million in investments in these Funds. Certain of the Funds’ positions include certificates of deposits, time deposits, commercial paper and corporate debt securities issued by counterparties in foreign countries. Schwab had outstanding margin loans to foreign residents of $746 million at December 31, 2018.- 45 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSSchwab uses the market approach to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, and to determine fair value disclosures. See Item 8 – Note 2 and Note 16 for more information on our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value.When available, Schwab uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. When utilizing market data and bid-ask spread, we use the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices do not exist, prices are obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets. We generally obtain prices from three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value. Our primary third-party pricing service provides prices based on observable trades and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar “to-be-issued” securities. We compare the prices obtained from the primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. Schwab does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material differences in the amounts recorded. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not adjust prices received from the primary independent third-party pricing service.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe consolidated financial statements of Schwab have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Item 8 – Note 2 contains more information on our significant accounting policies made in connection with its application of these accounting principles.While the majority of the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on Schwab’s financial position and reported financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy.Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Additionally, management has reviewed with the Audit Committee the Company’s significant estimates discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Income TaxesSchwab estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, including federal, state and local domestic jurisdictions, and immaterial amounts owed to several foreign jurisdictions. The estimated income tax expense is reported in the consolidated statements of income in taxes on income. Accrued taxes are reported in other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to future periods. Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. In estimating accrued taxes, we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position. Because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations, interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances. Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be - 46 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)significant to the operating results of the Company. See Item 8 – Note 20 for more information on the Company’s income taxes.Legal and Regulatory ReservesReserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved.

316709,SCHW,SCHWAB CHARLES CORP,2020,"Item 7.- 11 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONDevelopments in the business, economic, and geopolitical environment could negatively impact our business.Our business can be adversely affected by the general environment – economic, corporate, securities market, regulatory, and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations, trading activity, interest rates, and overall investor engagement, and are outside of our control. Deterioration in the housing and credit markets, reduction in short-term interest rates, and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact our results of operations and capital resources.Extensive regulation of our businesses may subject us to significant penalties or limitations on business activities.As a participant in the securities, banking, and financial services industries, we are subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws by governmental agencies, supervisory authorities and SROs. The costs and uncertainty related to complying with such regulations continue to increase. These regulations affect our business operations and impose capital, client protection, and market conduct requirements on us.In addition to specific banking laws and regulations, our banking regulators have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies and could require CSC and/or our banking subsidiaries to hold more capital, increase liquidity, or limit their ability to pay dividends or CSC’s ability to repurchase or redeem shares. The banking regulators could also limit our ability to grow, including adding assets, launching new products, making acquisitions, and undertaking strategic investments. Other potential regulatory actions include limiting our banking subsidiaries’ ability to accept deposits swept from client brokerage accounts and brokered deposits and preventing us from pursuing our business strategy.Despite our efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements, there are a number of risks, particularly in areas where applicable laws or regulations may be unclear or where regulators could revise their previous guidance. Any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by our regulators against us or our affiliates, officers or employees could result in fines, penalties, cease and desist orders, enforcement actions, suspension, disqualification or expulsion, or other disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on our business activities, any of which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.While we maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, violations could occur. In addition, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time. There may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance, including restrictions on certain activities. Such a finding may also damage our reputation and our relationships with our regulators and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities.Legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively affect our business and financial results.New legislation, rules, regulations and guidance, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal, state, foreign and SRO rules, regulations and guidance, including changes relating to mutual funds, broker-dealer fiduciary duties and regulatory treatment of deposit accounts, may directly affect the operation and profitability of Schwab or its specific business lines. Our profitability could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes to the laws governing taxation, electronic commerce, client privacy and security of client data. In addition, the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business we conduct, modifications to our business practices, more stringent capital and liquidity requirements, increased deposit insurance assessments or additional costs and could limit our ability to return capital to stockholders. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to our compliance, risk management, treasury and operations functions.Failure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect our financial condition.CSC, together with its banking and broker-dealer subsidiaries, must meet certain capital and liquidity standards, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about the adequacy of Schwab’s capital and Schwab’s internal assessment of its capital needs. The Uniform Net Capital Rule limits CS&Co’s ability to transfer capital to CSC and other affiliates. New regulatory capital, liquidity, and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including paying dividends, stock repurchases, and redemptions, and may require us to increase our capital and/or liquidity or to limit our - 12 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONgrowth. Failure by either CSC or its banking subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a negative impact on us. In addition, failure by CSC or our banking subsidiaries to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to satisfy their capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer requirements would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital, replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as Tier 1 Capital, or increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity, could require us to liquidate assets, deleverage or otherwise change our business and/or investment plans, which may adversely affect our financial results. Issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders.Effective December 31, 2019, CSC was assigned to Category III of the new tailored regulatory requirements. The Federal Reserve indicated that large savings and loan holding companies, including CSC, will become subject to the CCAR process. If CSC reaches $700 billion in total assets or $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activity, CSC will become subject to more stringent Category II requirements, including annual stress testing, the advanced approaches framework, the inability to opt out of including AOCI in regulatory capital calculations, the full LCR rule and daily liquidity reporting. CSC will also be subject to the full LCR rule and daily liquidity reporting if its weighted short-term wholesale funding is $75 billion or more. A significant change in client cash allocations could negatively impact our net interest revenue.We rely heavily on bank deposits as a funding source to extend loans to clients and purchase investment securities. Our bank deposits are primarily driven by our bank sweep feature when cash awaiting investment in our client brokerage accounts is swept to our banking subsidiaries. A significant reduction in our clients’ allocation to cash, a change in the allocation of that cash, or a transfer of cash away from the Company, could reduce net interest revenue. Significant interest rate changes could affect our profitability.The direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings. A decline in interest rates may have a negative impact on our net interest revenue. A low interest rate environment may also have a negative impact on our asset management and administration fee revenues if we have to waive a portion of our management fees for certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds in order to continue providing a positive return to clients.Although we believe we are positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment, a rise in interest rates may cause our funding costs to increase if market conditions or the competitive environment induces us to raise our interest rates to avoid losing deposits, or replace deposits with higher cost funding sources without offsetting increases in yields on interest-earning assets can reduce our net interest revenue.The expected phase-out of LIBOR could negatively impact our net interest revenue and require significant operational work.Certain securities in our investment portfolio and the floating rate loans we offer reference LIBOR as the benchmark rate to determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount. We also use LIBOR in many of our financial models, such as those used for capital stress testing, and to determine the dividend rates for certain of our series of preferred stock which begin to float in 2022 and later. If LIBOR is discontinued after 2021 as expected, there will be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments and there will be significant work required to transition to using the new benchmark rates and implement necessary changes to our systems and financial models. This could result in different financial performance for previously booked transactions and may impact our existing transaction data, products, systems, operations, and pricing processes. The calculation of interest rates under the replacement benchmarks could also impact our net interest revenue. In addition, LIBOR may perform differently during the phase-out period than in the past which could result in lower interest payments and a reduction in the value of certain securities in our investment portfolio.Security breaches of our systems, or those of our clients or third parties, may subject us to significant liability and damage Schwab’s reputation. Our business involves the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential information about our clients and us. Information security risks for financial institutions are increasing, in part because of the use of the internet and mobile technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, activists, hackers and other external parties, including foreign state actors. Our systems and those of other financial institutions have - 13 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONbeen and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, for example, employee misconduct.Given the high volume of transactions that we process, the large number of clients, counterparties and third-party service providers with which we do business and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks, a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected. The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before an investigation is completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known. During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.Security breaches, including breaches of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers or clients, could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject us to significant liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance, actions by our regulators, damage to Schwab’s reputation, or a loss of confidence in our security measures which could harm our business. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures.We also face risk related to external fraud involving the misappropriation and use of clients’ user names, passwords or other personal information to gain access to clients’ financial accounts at Schwab. This could occur from the compromise of clients’ personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company where clients’ personal information is taken and then made available to fraudsters. Such risk has grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties, including foreign state-sponsored parties. Losses reimbursed to clients under our guarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Technology and operational failures or errors could subject us to losses, litigation, regulatory actions, and reputational damage.We must process, record and monitor a large number of transactions and our operations are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology systems and our ability to make timely enhancements and additions to our systems. System interruptions, errors or downtime can result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to our systems, linkages with third-party systems and power failures and can have a significant impact on our business and operations. Our systems are vulnerable to disruptions from human error, execution errors, errors in models such as those used for asset management, capital planning and management, risk management, stress testing and compliance, employee misconduct, unauthorized trading, external fraud, computer viruses, distributed denial of service attacks, cyber attacks, terrorist attacks, natural disaster, power outage, capacity constraints, software flaws, events impacting key business partners and vendors, and similar events. For example, Schwab and other financial institutions have been the target of various denial of service attacks that have, in certain circumstances, made websites, mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time. It could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to our technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen occurrence, which could affect our ability to process and settle client transactions. Moreover, instances of fraud or other misconduct might also negatively impact Schwab’s reputation and client confidence in the Company, in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk, oversee operational areas involving risk, and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer unexpected losses, reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors, including those of our vendors or other third parties.While we devote substantial attention and resources to the reliability, capacity and scalability of our systems, extraordinary trading volumes could cause our computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail, affecting our ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients’ orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate. Disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses and decreased client satisfaction. We are also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges, clearing houses and other - 14 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONintermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement. System failures and constraints and transaction errors at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices, cause substantial losses for us and for our clients, and subject us to claims from our clients for damages. Our investment management operations may subject us to fiduciary or other legal liability for client losses.Fund and trust management and administration are complex activities and include functions such as recordkeeping and accounting, security pricing, corporate actions, compliance with investment restrictions, daily net asset value computations, account reconciliations, and required distributions to fund shareholders. Failure to properly perform operational tasks, or the misrepresentation of our services and products could subject us to regulatory sanctions, penalties or litigation and result in reputational damage, liability to clients, and the termination of investment management or administration agreements and the withdrawal of assets under our management.In the management and administration of funds and client accounts, we use quantitative models and other tools and resources to support investment decisions and processes, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, trading and hedging activities and product valuations. Errors in the design, function, or underlying assumptions used in these models and tools, particularly if we fail to detect the errors over an extended period, could subject us to claims of a breach of fiduciary duty and potentially large liabilities for make-whole payments, litigation, and/or regulatory fines.A significant decrease in our liquidity could negatively affect our business as well as reduce client confidence in Schwab.Maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to our business operations, including transaction settlement, custody requirements, and lending commitments, among other liquidity needs. We meet our liquidity needs primarily from working capital and cash generated by client activity, as well as external financing. Fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances, as well as market conditions or changes in regulatory treatment of client deposits, may affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs. A reduction in our liquidity position could reduce client confidence in Schwab, which could result in the transfer of client assets and accounts, or could cause us to fail to satisfy our liquidity requirements, including the LCR. In addition, if our broker-dealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines, regulators could limit the subsidiaries’ operations or their ability to upstream funds to CSC, which could reduce CSC’s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt, pay dividends on CSC’s preferred stock, or return capital to common stockholders. In addition, CSC may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries.Factors which may adversely affect our liquidity position include CS&Co having temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances, fluctuations in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts, a dramatic increase in our lending activities (including margin, mortgage-related, and personal lending), increased capital requirements, changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations, other regulatory changes, or a loss of market or client confidence in Schwab resulting in unanticipated withdrawals of client funds.When available cash is not sufficient for our liquidity needs, we may seek external financing. During periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets, potential sources of external financing could be reduced, and borrowing costs could increase. Although CSC and CS&Co maintain committed and uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines and CSC has a commercial paper issuance program, as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC which can be used to sell securities, financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets. In addition, a significant downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets.We may suffer significant losses from our credit exposures.Our businesses are subject to the risk that a client, counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations, or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate. While we have policies and procedures designed to manage this risk, the policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Our exposure mainly results from margin lending, clients’ options and futures trading, securities lending, mortgage lending, pledged asset lending, our role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities, and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds we sponsor.- 15 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONWhen clients purchase securities on margin, borrow on lines of credit collateralized by securities, or trade options or futures, we are subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their accounts falls below the amount of clients’ indebtedness. Abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses.We have exposure to credit risk associated with our investments. Those investments are subject to price fluctuations. Loss of value of securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such loss of value has resulted from a credit loss. The evaluation of whether a credit loss exists is a matter of judgment, which includes the assessment of multiple factors. If management determines that a security’s decline in fair value is the result of a credit loss, an allowance for credit losses on the security will be recorded and a corresponding loss will be recognized in current earnings. Even if a decline in fair value of a security is not determined to have resulted from a credit loss, if we were ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity needs, we would have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time. Our bank loans primarily consist of First Mortgages, HELOCs, and PALs. Increases in delinquency and default rates, housing and stock price declines, increases in the unemployment rate, and other economic factors can result in increases in allowances for credit losses and related credit loss expense, as well as write downs on such loans.On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”, which requires estimation of expected lifetime credit losses, rather than incurred losses only, as was previously required. For more information on this adoption, see Part II – Item 8 – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 2.Heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments can increase our risk of loss. Examples include:•Large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry;•Mortgage loans and HELOCs to banking clients which are secured by properties in the same geographic region; and•Client margins, options or futures, pledged assets, and securities lending activities collateralized by or linked to securities of a single issuer, index, or industry.We sponsor a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds. Although we have no obligation to do so, we may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit, liquidity or other support to our funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity. Such support could cause us to take significant charges, could reduce our liquidity and, in certain situations, could, with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds, result in us having to consolidate one or more funds in our financial statements. If we choose not to provide credit, liquidity or other support in such a situation, Schwab could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected.We are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending against claims or proceedings.The financial services industry faces significant litigation and regulatory risks. We are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages. We are also the subject of inquiries, investigations, and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies.Litigation and arbitration claims include those brought by our clients and the clients of third party advisors whose assets are custodied at Schwab. Claims from clients of third party advisors may allege losses due to investment decisions made by the third party advisors or the advisors’ misconduct. Litigation claims also include claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights (e.g., patents). Such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources. If we were found to have infringed on a third-party patent, or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial damages, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology, or providing certain products or services.Actions brought against us may result in settlements, awards, injunctions, fines, penalties or other results adverse to us, including reputational harm. Even if we are successful in defending against these actions, the defense of such matters may - 16 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONresult in us incurring significant expenses. A substantial judgment, settlement, fine, or penalty could be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular future period, depending on our results for that period. In market downturns and periods of heightened volatility, the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased. We rely on outsourced service providers to perform key functions.We rely on external service providers to perform certain key technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. These service providers face technology, operating, business, and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee, or company information, could cause us to incur losses and could harm Schwab’s reputation. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider as a result of systems failures, capacity constraints, financial difficulties or for any other reason, and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services, and result in financial losses to us. Switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations.Potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on our financial position.We evaluate potential strategic transactions, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions. Any such transaction could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The process of evaluating, negotiating, and effecting any such strategic transaction may divert management’s attention from other business concerns, and might cause the loss of key clients, employees, and business partners. Moreover, integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties, including the need to integrate operational, financial, and management information systems and management controls, integrate relationships with clients and business partners, and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas. In addition, an acquisition may cause us to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings. Further, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition (including without limitation the pending acquisitions of TD Ameritrade and assets of USAA-IMCO), and any future acquisition could be dilutive to our current stockholders’ percentage ownership or to earnings per common share (EPS).Our acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in the business, operations or financial condition of the entity being acquired or sold. To the extent we enter into an agreement to buy or sell an entity, there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected, or at all. If a material transaction does not close, our stock price could decline.Our industry is highly competitive and characterized by aggressive price competition.We operate in a highly competitive environment with a broad array of competitors from large integrated banks to venture-capital backed private companies. We continually monitor our pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjust interest rates on deposits and loans, fees for advisory services, expense ratios on mutual funds and ETFs, trade commission rates, and other pricing and incentives to sustain our competitive position. Increased price competition from other financial services firms to attract clients, such as reduced commissions, higher deposit rates, reduced mutual fund or ETF expense ratios, or the increased use of incentives, could impact our results of operations and financial condition.We face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees.The market for qualified personnel in our business is highly competitive. At various times, different functions and roles are in especially high demand in the market, compelling us to pay more to attract talent. Our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs.- 17 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONOur stock price has fluctuated historically, and may continue to fluctuate.Our stock price can be volatile. Among the factors that may affect the volatility of our stock price are the following:•Our exposure to changes in interest rates;•Speculation in the investment community or the press about, or actual changes in, our competitive position, organizational structure, executive team, operations, financial condition, financial reporting and results, expense discipline, or strategic transactions;•The announcement of new products, services, acquisitions, or dispositions by us or our competitors; •Increases or decreases in revenue or earnings, changes in earnings estimates by the investment community, and variations between estimated financial results and actual financial results; and•Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by large stockholders.Changes in the stock market generally, or as it concerns our industry, as well as geopolitical, corporate, regulatory, business, and economic factors may also affect our stock price.Future sales of CSC’s equity securities may adversely affect the market price of CSC’s common stock and result in dilution.CSC’s certificate of incorporation authorizes CSC’s Board of Directors, among other things, to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities, without stockholder approval.CSC may issue additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital or for other purposes. The issuance of any additional equity or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of CSC’s common stock and may adversely affect the market price of CSC’s common stock.Risks Related to the Proposed Merger with TD AmeritradeCompletion of the merger is subject to many conditions and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the merger will not be completed. The obligations of CSC and TD Ameritrade to complete the merger are subject to satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver) of a number of conditions, including, among others: •the affirmative vote of (A) the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of TD Ameritrade common stock approving and adopting the Merger Agreement and (B) the holders (other than TD Bank, the Significant TD Ameritrade Stockholders and their respective affiliates) of a majority of the outstanding shares of TD Ameritrade common stock (other than shares of TD Ameritrade common stock held by TD Bank, the Significant TD Ameritrade Stockholders and their respective affiliates) approving and adopting the Merger Agreement; •the affirmative vote of (A) a majority of the votes cast by holders of outstanding shares of Schwab common stock approving the share issuance and (B) the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Schwab common stock approving the Schwab charter amendment;•expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (or extension thereof) under the HSR Act and certain governmental authorizations having been made or obtained and being in full force and effect; •receipt of noncontrol determinations from the Federal Reserve;•accuracy of the representations and warranties made in the Merger Agreement by the other party, subject to certain materiality thresholds; •performance in all material respects by the other party of the obligations required to be performed by it at or prior to completion of the merger; and •the absence since the date of the Merger Agreement of a material adverse effect on the other party.There can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the merger will be satisfied or waived in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the merger may not be completed. If the merger is not completed for any reason, the ongoing business of CSC may be adversely affected and, without realizing the benefits of having completed the merger, we would be subject to a number of risks, including that we may receive negative reactions from our stockholders, employees, customers and regulators, and that the price of our common stock may decline to the extent that current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed.- 18 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONAs a condition to authorization of the merger, governmental authorities may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of our business after completion of the merger. Such conditions or changes and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could, among other things, have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger, or otherwise adversely affecting our businesses and results of operations after completion of the merger.Also, if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, we may be required to pay a termination fee of $950 million to TD Ameritrade and we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement. In addition, the Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our businesses prior to completion of the merger, and such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to consent of TD Ameritrade, could prevent us from making certain acquisitions, taking certain other specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the merger that we would have made, taken or pursued if these restrictions were not in place.CSC and TD Ameritrade may also be subject to lawsuits challenging the merger, and adverse rulings in these lawsuits may delay or prevent the merger from being completed or require CSC or TD Ameritrade to incur significant costs to defend or settle these lawsuits. If any of these risks materialize, they may materially and adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, financial results, ratings, and/or stock price.Schwab’s business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the merger. Parties with which we do business may experience uncertainty associated with the merger, including with respect to current or future business relationships with Schwab or the combined business. Schwab’s business relationships may be subject to disruption as parties with which Schwab does business may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than Schwab or the combined business. These disruptions could have an adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of the combined business, including an adverse effect on Schwab’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger. The risk, and adverse effect, of such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. After completion of the merger, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger, which could adversely affect the value of our stock.The success of the merger will depend, in significant part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses of Schwab and TD Ameritrade. Our ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to certain risks. If Schwab is not able to successfully combine the businesses of Schwab and TD Ameritrade within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected, the combined business may not perform as expected and the value of Schwab common stock may be adversely affected. Schwab and TD Ameritrade have operated and, until completion of the merger, will continue to operate, independently, and there can be no assurances that their businesses can be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key Schwab or TD Ameritrade employees, the loss of clients, the disruption of either company’s or both companies’ ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. In addition, at times the attention of certain members of either company’s or both companies’ management and resources may be focused on completion of the merger and the integration of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt each company’s ongoing business and the business of the combined company. Schwab will incur significant transaction and merger-related costs in connection with the merger. We expect to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with the merger and combining the operations of the two - 19 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONcompanies. Some of these costs have already been incurred or may be incurred regardless of whether the merger is completed. Schwab also will incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans with respect to the two companies, including facilities and systems consolidation costs. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the merger and the integration of the two companies’ businesses. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow us to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. Schwab and TD Ameritrade may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other employees in light of the merger.Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on Schwab and TD Ameritrade employees may impair Schwab’s and TD Ameritrade’s ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel prior to and following the merger. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the merger, as employees of Schwab and TD Ameritrade may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined business. In addition, pursuant to change-in-control provisions in their respective employment agreements or term sheets with TD Ameritrade, certain employees of TD Ameritrade are entitled to receive severance payments upon a constructive termination of employment. Such TD Ameritrade employees potentially could terminate their employment following specified circumstances set forth in their employment agreements or term sheets, including certain changes in such employees’ position, compensation or benefits and collect severance. Such circumstances could occur in connection with the merger as a result of changes in roles and responsibilities. If employees of Schwab or TD Ameritrade depart, the integration of the companies may be more difficult and the combined business following the merger may be harmed. Furthermore, Schwab may have to incur significant costs in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent relating to the businesses of Schwab or TD Ameritrade, and Schwab’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger may be adversely affected. In addition, there could be disruptions to or distractions for the workforce and management associated with integrating employees into Schwab. The merger may not be accretive to Schwab’s earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of Schwab common stock following completion of the merger. In connection with the completion of the merger, Schwab expects to issue approximately 586 million Schwab common shares. The issuance of new Schwab common shares could have the effect of depressing the market price of Schwab common shares. Based on the anticipated synergies between Schwab and TD Ameritrade, the merger is expected to be accretive to Schwab’s earnings per share in the third year following completion of the merger. However, future events and conditions could reduce or delay the accretion that is currently projected or result in the merger being dilutive to Schwab’s earnings per share, including adverse changes in market conditions, additional transaction and integration related costs and other factors such as the failure to realize some or all of the benefits anticipated in the merger. Any dilution of, reduction in, or delay of any accretion to, Schwab’s earnings per share could cause the price of shares of Schwab common stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate. If our pending merger with TD Ameritrade is completed, our stockholders’ ownership percentage will be diluted. If the proposed merger is completed, we will issue to TD Ameritrade stockholders shares of our common stock. As a result of the issuance of these shares of our common stock, our stockholders will own a smaller percentage of the combined company after the merger and will therefore have a reduced voting interest. In addition, TD Bank will become our largest stockholder. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.- 20 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONItem 2.

We believe that metrics relating to net new and total client assets, as well as client cash levels and utilization of advisory services, offer perspective on our business momentum and client engagement. Data on new and total client brokerage accounts provides additional perspective on our ability to attract and retain new business. Total net revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin, EPS, return on average common stockholders’ equity, and the Consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio provide broad indicators of Schwab’s overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns. Total expenses, excluding interest, as a percentage of average client assets, is a measure of operating efficiency.

Throughout the year, investor sentiment reflected a complex market environment that included global trade negotiations and an uncertain domestic economic outlook. The Federal Reserve ended up cutting the federal funds target interest rate three times, in a reversal of the increases seen in 2018. At the same time, stocks continued to rise, with the S&P 500 increasing 29% during the year. Core net new assets totaled $211.7 billion for the year, representing an organic growth rate of 7% and our second consecutive year over $200 billion. Clients opened 1.6 million new brokerage accounts in 2019, while active brokerage accounts grew 6% to 12.3 million. Our success in asset gathering combined with strong market returns drove total client assets to reach $4.04 trillion at December 31, 2019, closing the year up 24%. - 30 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Company actions to benefit clients and build long-term value during 2019 included the elimination of online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options, which became effective October 7th. The Company also announced two significant acquisitions during the year. In July, the Company agreed to acquire assets of USAA-IMCO and agreed to enter into a long-term referral agreement. In late November, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire TD Ameritrade. Against the backdrop of the more challenging than expected macroeconomic environment and our own pricing decisions, Schwab’s net income totaled $3.7 billion in 2019, an increase of $197 million, or 6%. Diluted earnings per common share grew to $2.67, representing an increase of 9% from 2018.Total net revenues reached $10.7 billion, up 6% in 2019. Net interest revenue increased 12% in 2019 to $6.5 billion, driven by higher average investment yields and also by an increase in client cash balances held at our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries. While trading revenue declined 19% to $617 million due to our pricing actions, asset management and administration fees remained essentially flat with 2018 at $3.2 billion, decreasing 1%. Growing enrollment in advice solutions, along with rising balances in other third-party mutual funds, helped to largely offset declines in Mutual Fund OneSource® and lower sweep money market fund revenue due to transfers of sweep money market funds to our balance sheet in 2018 and early 2019. Total expenses excluding interest increased 5% in 2019 to $5.9 billion, which included $62 million in severance charges associated with a 3% reduction in our workforce and $25 million in costs relating to the announced acquisitions of assets of USAA-IMCO and TD Ameritrade. Our ongoing focus on driving efficiency while managing our spending in a disciplined manner helped us maintain a ratio of expenses to client assets of 16 bps for 2019. Reflecting our commitment to balancing long-term profitability with reinvesting for growth, we achieved a 45.2% pre-tax profit margin and a 19% return on equity in 2019, representing our second consecutive year of at least 45% and 19%, respectively.Disciplined balance sheet management remains core to our strategy as we continue to support business growth and meaningful capital returns across a range of conditions. In early 2019, the Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend 31% to $0.17 per share and authorized the repurchase of up to $4.0 billion of common stock; during 2019 we repurchased 55 million shares for $2.2 billion under this authorization. As of December 31, 2019, our balance sheet assets were $294 billion, down 1% from a year ago; our Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 7.3% at year-end. As the Company continues to grow both organically and through our pending acquisitions, our intent to return excess capital above our long-term operating objective of 6.75%-7.00% remains in place. Planned AcquisitionsTD Ameritrade: On November 25, 2019, CSC announced a definitive agreement to acquire TD Ameritrade in an all-stock transaction. At the time of announcement, TD Ameritrade had approximately twelve million brokerage accounts and $1.3 trillion in total client assets. Under the agreement, TD Ameritrade stockholders will receive 1.0837 CSC shares for each TD Ameritrade share. Based on the closing price of CSC common stock on November 20, 2019, the merger consideration represented approximately $26 billion. The Company anticipates this transaction will add scale to help support the Company’s ongoing efforts to enhance the client experience, provide deeper resources for RIAs, and continue to improve our operating efficiency. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2020, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions. Under certain circumstances, CSC or TD Ameritrade could be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $950 million or reimburse the other party’s fees up to $50 million.Assets of USAA-IMCO: On July 25, 2019, the Company announced a definitive agreement to acquire assets of USAA-IMCO, including over one million brokerage and managed portfolio accounts with approximately $90 billion in client assets at the time of announcement, for $1.8 billion in cash. The companies have also agreed to enter into a long-term referral agreement, effective at closing of the acquisition, which would make Schwab the exclusive wealth management and brokerage provider for USAA members. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2020, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the implementation of conversion plans.The Company expects to recognize significant amounts of goodwill and amortizable intangible assets as part of the planned acquisitions.- 31 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)2018 Compared to 2017 Net income increased by $1.2 billion, or 49%, in 2018, driven primarily by business momentum, a supportive economic environment for much of the year, and lower corporate tax rates. Continued execution of our ‘Through Clients’ Eyes’ strategy helped us succeed with clients. In 2018, clients opened 1.6 million new brokerage accounts, helping bring active brokerage accounts to 11.6 million at the end of the year, and core net new assets totaled $227.8 billion, up 15% from the 2017 total. Our strong net new assets largely offset lower market valuations, and we ended 2018 at $3.25 trillion in total client assets.Total net revenue grew by $1.5 billion, or 18%, in 2018 primarily due to an increase of $1.5 billion, or 36%, in net interest revenue. The Fed raised the federal funds target interest rate four times in 2018 for a total of 100 basis points. The growth of total net revenue resulted from higher interest rates due to the Fed’s rate increases, and also from higher interest-earning assets, which reflect both client cash allocations and the transfer of sweep money market funds to bank and broker-dealer sweep. As we progressed with these transfers, the corresponding money market fund asset management and administration fee revenue naturally declined, yet positive inflows in advice solutions, Schwab equity and bond funds and ETFs, and other third-party mutual funds and ETFs kept asset management fees at $3.2 billion, limiting the decrease to 5% from 2017. Record trading activity from our clients resulted in trading revenue reaching $763 million, an increase of 17% from the prior year.Our increase in total expenses excluding interest of $602 million, or 12%, reflected our 2018 investments to support and fuel our business growth, including hiring additional client-facing and other employees and technology project spending, as well as an increase in marketing and a special stock award of $36 million to our employees. Even with these increases, expenses as a percentage of client assets remained consistent at 16 basis points, and pre-tax income increased 25% to $4.6 billion in 2018, resulting in a pre-tax profit margin of 45.0%. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act), taxes on income decreased 19% in 2018, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.1%. Overall, we generated a 19% return on equity and diluted EPS of $2.45 for the year.During 2018, the Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend 63% to $0.13 per share and authorized a $1.0 billion Share Repurchase Program, which we completed during the fourth quarter of 2018. These actions reflected the Company’s strong financial performance and our confidence in its long-term success; they also demonstrated that effective capital management at Schwab can support both healthy business growth and more meaningful capital returns to stockholders. Subsequent EventsIn October 2019, the Federal Reserve issued a final enhanced prudential standards rule, and the Federal Reserve, OCC, and the FDIC jointly issued a final regulatory capital and liquidity rule. With total consolidated assets of $294.0 billion at December 31, 2019, CSC is designated as a Category III firm pursuant to the framework established by the final rules. Accordingly, the Company opted to exclude AOCI from its regulatory capital as permitted by the regulatory capital and liquidity rule beginning January 1, 2020. In accordance with ASC 320, Investments – Debt and Equity Securities (ASC 320) and as of January 1, 2020, the Company transferred all of its investment securities designated as held to maturity (HTM) to the AFS category without tainting our intent to hold other debt securities to maturity. At the date of transfer, these securities had a total amortized cost of $134.7 billion and a total net unrealized gain of $1.4 billion.CURRENT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTSIn December 2019, the FDIC issued a proposed rule that would modernize its brokered deposits regulations. Among other things, the proposed rule would clarify the “primary purpose” exception from the definition of a deposit broker for securities broker-dealers such as CS&Co that place deposits through brokerage sweep arrangements under certain conditions. In addition, the proposed rule would create a streamlined application process for obtaining a primary purpose exception where less than 25 percent of a broker-dealer’s customer assets are placed with a depository institution. Schwab is currently evaluating the impact of the proposed rule on its bank sweep program.In January 2020, the OCC and the FDIC published their jointly proposed revisions to the regulations implementing the CRA. The proposed regulations (i) clarify and expand what qualifies for CRA credit; (ii) expand where CRA activity counts; (iii) provide an objective method to measure CRA activity; and (iv) revise data collection, recordkeeping, and reporting. The - 32 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Federal Reserve did not join the OCC and the FDIC in the proposed regulations. The comment period for the proposed regulations ends on March 9, 2020. Schwab is currently evaluating the impact of the proposed regulations.In May 2016, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC jointly issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would impose a minimum NSFR on certain banking organizations, including CSC. The comment period for the proposed rule ended on August 5, 2016 and the impact to the Company cannot be assessed until the final rule is released. The agencies indicated in the October 2019 interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rule their intention to utilize the four category tiering framework when the NSFR rule is adopted.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSTotal Net RevenuesTotal net revenues of $10.7 billion and $10.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, represented growth of 6% and 18% from the prior periods, primarily due to increases in net interest revenue.Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Growth Rate2018-2019 Amount% ofTotal NetRevenues Amount% ofTotal NetRevenues Amount% ofTotal NetRevenuesNet interest revenue Interest revenue13% $7,58071% $6,68066% $4,62454%Interest expense24% (1,064)(10)% (857)(9)% (342)(4)%Net interest revenue12% 6,51661% 5,82357% 4,28250%Asset management and administration fees Mutual funds, ETFs, and collective trust funds (CTFs) (1)(5)% 1,74716% 1,83718% 2,08824%Advice solutions5% 1,19811% 1,13911% 1,04312%Other (1)5% 2663% 2533% 2613%Asset management and administration fees(1)% 3,21130% 3,22932% 3,39239%Trading revenue Commissions(20)% 5495% 6857% 6007%Principal transactions(13)% 681% 781% 541%Trading revenue(19)% 6176% 7638% 6548%Other19% 3773% 3173% 2903%Total net revenues6% $10,721100% $10,132100% $8,618100%(1) Beginning in 2019, a change was made to move CTFs from other asset management and administration fees. Prior periods have been recast to reflect this change.Net Interest RevenueSchwab’s primary interest-earning assets include cash and cash equivalents; cash and investments segregated; margin loans, which constitute the majority of receivables from brokerage clients; investment securities; and bank loans. Revenue on interest-earning assets is affected by various factors, such as the composition of assets, prevailing interest rates and spreads at the time of origination or purchase, changes in interest rates on floating rate securities and loans, and changes in prepayment levels for mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and loans. Fees earned on securities borrowing and lending activities, which are conducted by CS&Co using assets held in client brokerage accounts, are primarily included in other interest revenue and expense.Schwab’s interest-bearing liabilities include bank deposits, payables to brokerage clients, short-term borrowings (e.g., Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances), and long-term debt. Non-interest-bearing funding sources include stockholders’ equity, certain client cash balances, and other miscellaneous liabilities. We establish the rates paid on client-related liabilities, and management expects that it will generally adjust the rates paid on these liabilities at some fraction of any movement in short-term rates. Schwab deploys the funds from these sources into the - 33 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)assets outlined above. We do not use short-term, wholesale borrowings to support our long-term investment activity, but may use such funding, including FHLB advances, for short-term liquidity purposes or to provide temporary funding (e.g., for investment purchases) ahead of anticipated balance sheet deposit growth.In order to keep interest-rate sensitivity within established limits, management actively monitors and adjusts interest-rate sensitivity through changes in the balance sheet, primarily by adjusting the composition of our banking subsidiaries’ investment portfolios. As Schwab builds its client base, we attract new client sweep cash, which is a primary driver of funding balance sheet growth. Towards the end of 2018, the federal funds target interest rate increased to levels not seen in over a decade, leading us to expect some clients would shift more of their cash holdings from brokerage deposits swept to our banking subsidiaries to higher-yielding alternatives like purchased money market funds. We therefore expected brokerage deposits swept to our banking subsidiaries, excluding organic growth, to decline during the first part of 2019. As a result, we held a higher amount of short-term liquidity at our banking subsidiaries at the end of 2018 to accommodate this potential client cash sorting.While average interest rates throughout the year in 2019 were higher than average rates in 2018, interest rates across maturities declined from December 2018 to December 2019. Lower interest rates typically result in longer durations on our client-related liabilities and shorter durations on our investment securities, especially mortgage-related securities with options to prepay without penalty. During 2019, to maintain our overall targeted interest rate risk profile, we began positioning our banking entities’ investment portfolios to include a higher percentage of fixed-rate, longer duration investments to reduce our interest rate sensitivities which would naturally increase as market rates declined. We did, however, once again hold a higher level of short-term liquidity at the end of 2019 to accommodate a typical seasonal buildup of client cash, much of which then generally moves to other assets within a few months.We believe that the process of clients sorting between transactional cash and cash held for investment is subsiding. Aligned with market consensus, we do not expect to see a significant increase in market rates in the near term. Over the course of 2020, we expect to further reduce our exposure to lower rates primarily by adding a larger percentage of fixed-rate securities with relatively longer duration to our ongoing purchases as a result of maturities, prepayments, organic deposit growth, on-boarding of USAA-IMCO client cash to our balance sheet, and any potential asset-liability-management-driven investment portfolio re-balancing. As such, we expect the duration difference between our liabilities and assets to decline over the course of 2020. - 34 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)The following table presents net interest revenue information corresponding to interest-earning assets and funding sources on the consolidated balance sheets:Year Ended December 31,2019 2018 2017 AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense Average Yield/Rate AverageBalance Interest Revenue/Expense Average Yield/Rate AverageBalance Interest Revenue/Expense Average Yield/RateInterest-earning assets Cash and cash equivalents$23,512 $518 2.17% $17,783 $348 1.93% $9,931 $109 1.10%Cash and investments segregated15,694 345 2.17% 11,461 206 1.78% 18,525 166 0.90%Broker-related receivables376 7 1.87% 303 6 2.09% 430 3 0.70%Receivables from brokerage clients19,270 821 4.20% 19,870 830 4.12% 16,269 575 3.53%Available for sale securities (1)58,181 1,560 2.67% 54,542 1,241 2.26% 53,040 815 1.54%Held to maturity securities134,708 3,591 2.65% 131,794 3,348 2.53% 103,599 2,354 2.27%Bank loans16,832 584 3.47% 16,554 559 3.37% 15,919 472 2.97%Total interest-earning assets268,573 7,426 2.75% 252,307 6,538 2.57% 217,713 4,494 2.06%Other interest revenue 154 142 130 Total interest-earning assets$268,573 $7,580 2.80% $252,307 $6,680 2.63% $217,713 $4,624 2.12%Funding sources Bank deposits$212,605 $700 0.33% $199,139 $545 0.27% $163,998 $148 0.09%Payables to brokerage clients24,353 79 0.33% 21,178 56 0.27% 25,403 16 0.06%Short-term borrowings (2)17 — 2.36% 3,359 54 1.59% 3,503 41 1.17%Long-term debt7,199 258 3.58% 5,423 190 3.50% 3,431 119 3.47%Total interest-bearing liabilities244,174 1,037 0.42% 229,099 845 0.37% 196,335 324 0.17%Non-interest-bearing funding sources24,399 23,208 21,378 Other interest expense 27 12 18 Total funding sources$268,573 $1,064 0.39% $252,307 $857 0.34% $217,713 $342 0.15%Net interest revenue $6,516 2.41% $5,823 2.29% $4,282 1.97%(1) Amounts have been calculated based on amortized cost.(2) Interest revenue or expense was less than $500,000 in the period or periods presented.Net interest revenue increased $693 million or 12%, in 2019 from 2018, and $1.5 billion, or 36%, in 2018 from 2017, due to higher average investment yields and growth in interest earning assets.Our net interest margin improved 12 basis points to 2.41% in 2019, driven primarily by higher average yields received on interest-earning assets in 2019 due largely to the net impact of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases in 2018 and decreases in the third and fourth quarters of 2019. The increase in average yields on interest-earning assets was partially offset by higher average interest rates paid on bank deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. The portfolio adjustments made in 2019 as described above helped to moderate the impact of the declining rate environment on our net interest margin. Average interest-earning assets grew 6% from 2018 to 2019, primarily driven by higher bank deposits due to transfers from sweep money market funds to bank sweep, as well as higher client cash balances. Our net interest margin improved 32 basis points to 2.29% in 2018, primarily as a result of the Federal Reserve’s 2017 and 2018 interest rate increases, partially offset by higher interest rates paid on bank deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. Average interest earning assets grew 16% from 2017 to 2018, primarily reflecting higher bank deposits due to transfers from sweep money market funds to bank sweep, as well as changes in client cash allocations, partially offset by client purchases of other assets. In March 2017, the Company transferred $24.7 billion of debt securities from the AFS category to the HTM category. The transfer had no effect on the overall net interest margin. Short-term borrowings in 2018 and 2017 primarily included FHLB advances, which were used to provide temporary funding for investments ahead of deposit growth. - 35 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Asset Management and Administration FeesAsset management and administration fees include mutual fund, ETF, and CTF service fees and fees for other asset-based financial services provided to individual and institutional clients. Schwab earns mutual fund, ETF, and CTF service fees for shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. Asset management and administration fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in these funds and do not include securities lending revenues earned by proprietary mutual funds, ETFs, and CTFs, as those amounts, net of program fees, are credited to the fund shareholders. Proprietary CTFs may, but generally do not, directly participate in securities lending. The fair values of client assets included in proprietary and third-party mutual funds, ETFs, and CTFs are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data.We also earn asset management fees for advice solutions, which include managed portfolios, specialized strategies, and customized investment advice. Other asset management and administration fees include various asset-based fees such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, mutual fund clearing fees, and non-balance based service and transaction fees.Asset management and administration fees vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity.

Part of the decline was offset by revenue from growing asset balances in purchased money market funds, other third-party mutual funds and ETFs, and in advice solutions. Asset management and administration fees decreased by $163 million, or 5%, in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to lower money market fund revenue as a result of transfers to bank sweep, client asset allocation choices, and lower fee rates on - 36 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)proprietary money funds and other indexed mutual funds and ETFs due to fee reductions implemented by the Company in 2017.

Commission revenue is affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. Principal transaction revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from trading activity in fixed income securities with clients. To accommodate clients’ fixed income trading activity, Schwab maintains positions in fixed income securities, including U.S. state and municipal debt obligations, U.S. Government and corporate debt, and other securities. The difference between the price at which the Company buys and sells securities to and from its clients and other broker-dealers is recognized as principal transaction revenue. Principal transaction revenue also includes adjustments to the fair value of these securities positions.The following table presents trading revenue and the related drivers:Year Ended December 31,Growth Rate2018-2019 2019 2018 2017DARTs (in thousands)(20)% 338.4 420.9 321.3Daily average trades (in thousands)(2)% 748.9 765.4 608.8Number of trading days— 250.5 249.5 250.0Daily average revenue per revenue trade— $7.26 $7.23 $8.20Trading revenue(19)% $617 $763 $654Trading revenue decreased by $146 million, or 19%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a 20% decrease in DART volumes in 2019 as a result of the elimination of online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options effective October 7, 2019. Trading revenue increased by $109 million, or 17%, in 2018 compared to 2017. This increase was due primarily to a 31% increase in DART volumes in 2018, which more than offset Schwab’s 2017 commission pricing reductions to lower standard equity, ETF, and option trade commissions from $8.95 to $4.95 and lower the per contract option fee from $.75 to $.65. Other RevenueOther revenue includes order flow revenue, other service fees, software fees from our portfolio management solutions, exchange processing fees, and non-recurring gains. Other revenue increased $60 million, or 19%, in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to a gain from the sale of a portfolio management and reporting software solution for advisors to Tamarac Inc. in the second quarter of 2019 and a gain from the assignment of leased office space in the first quarter of 2019. Order flow revenue was $135 million during 2019, $139 million for 2018, and $114 million in 2017. The increase in 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to higher rebate rates received on certain types of orders and higher volume of trades.- 37 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Total Expenses Excluding InterestThe following table shows a comparison of total expenses excluding interest: Growth Rate 2018-2019 2019 2018 2017Compensation and benefits Salaries and wages16% $1,958 $1,692 $1,496Incentive compensation(6)% 804 855 797Employee benefits and other9% 558 510 444Total compensation and benefits9% $3,320 $3,057 $2,737Professional services7% 702 654 580Occupancy and equipment13% 559 496 436Advertising and market development(2)% 307 313 268Communications5% 253 242 231Depreciation and amortization14% 349 306 269Regulatory fees and assessments(35)% 122 189 179Other(17)% 261 313 268Total expenses excluding interest5% $5,873 $5,570 $4,968Expenses as a percentage of total net revenues Compensation and benefits 31% 30% 32%Advertising and market development 3% 3% 3%Full-time equivalent employees (in thousands) At year end1% 19.7 19.5 17.6Average7% 20.0 18.7 16.9໿Expenses excluding interest increased in 2019 and 2018 from the prior years by 5% and 12%, respectively. The largest driver of the increase in both years was compensation and benefits costs.Total compensation and benefits increased in 2019 from 2018, primarily due to both an overall increase in employee headcount to support our expanding client base and higher severance costs, which included $62 million associated with a 3% reduction in our workforce in the third quarter of 2019. The increase in 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to increases in employee headcount; additionally, special stock awards were issued in 2018 to non-officer employees, totaling $36 million.Professional services expense increased in 2019 from 2018, primarily due to overall growth in the business, investments in projects to further drive efficiency and scale, and certain costs relating to pending acquisitions. The increase in 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to higher spending on technology projects as well as an increase in asset management and administration related expenses resulting from growth in the Schwab Funds® and Schwab ETFs™. Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2019 and 2018 from the prior years, primarily due to increases in software maintenance expenses and additional licenses to support growth in the business.Advertising and market development expense increased in 2018 from 2017, primarily reflecting management’s decision to increase television advertising and digital media spending in the fourth quarter of 2018. Depreciation and amortization expenses grew in 2019 and 2018 from the prior years, primarily due to higher amortization of internally developed software associated with continued investments in software and technology enhancements.Regulatory fees and assessments decreased in 2019 from 2018, primarily due to a decrease in FDIC insurance assessments resulting from the elimination of the FDIC surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018. Regulatory fees and assessments - 38 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)increased in 2018 from 2017, due to an increase in FDIC insurance assessments which rose as a result of higher average assets in deposit balances, partially offset by the elimination of the FDIC surcharge.Other expenses decreased in 2019 from 2018, primarily due to lower travel and entertainment expense and bad debt expense. Other expenses increased in 2018 from 2017 due to travel and entertainment and miscellaneous items due to overall growth in the business. Capital expenditures were $753 million, $576 million, and $412 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The increases in capital expenditures in 2019 and 2018 from the prior years were primarily due to the expansion of our campuses in the U.S., with investments in buildings totaling $397 million and $253 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Capitalized costs for developing internal-use software totaled $165 million, $167 million, and $157 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Our capital expenditures for 2019 equaled 7% of total net revenues, within our estimated range for the year. Along with continued campus expansion, we will continue to invest further in technology projects in 2020. Excluding any potential impact of the pending acquisition of TD Ameritrade, we anticipate capital expenditures in 2020 to be approximately 5-6% of total net revenues, while our longer term expectation for capital expenditures remains in the range of 3-5% of total net revenues.Taxes on IncomeOn December 22, 2017, P.L.115-97, the Tax Act, was signed into law, and became effective on January 1, 2018. Among other things, the Tax Act lowered the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018. As a result of the Tax Act, Schwab recognized a $46 million one-time non-cash charge to taxes on income in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and other tax adjustments related to the Tax Act.Schwab’s effective income tax rate on income before taxes was 23.6% in 2019, 23.1% in 2018, and 35.5% in 2017. The change in rates in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in equity compensation tax deduction benefits which reduced our tax expense by approximately $23 million and $46 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change in rates in 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to impacts of the Tax Act and a decrease in equity compensation tax deduction benefits, which totaled $87 million in 2017. Segment InformationSchwab provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments – Investor Services and Advisor Services. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services to individual investors, and retirement plan services, as well as other corporate brokerage services to businesses and their employees. The Advisor Services segment provides custodial, trading, banking, and support services, as well as retirement business services, to independent RIAs, independent retirement advisors, and recordkeepers. Revenues and expenses are attributed to the two segments based on which segment services the client. Management evaluates the performance of the segments on a pre-tax basis. Segment assets and liabilities are not used for evaluating segment performance or in deciding how to allocate resources to segments. Net revenues in both segments are generated from the underlying client assets and trading activity; differences in the composition of net revenues between the segments are based on the composition of client assets, client trading frequency, and pricing unique to each. While both segments leverage the scale and efficiency of our platforms, segment expenses reflect the dynamics of serving millions of clients in Investor Services versus the thousands of RIAs on the advisor platform.- 39 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Financial information for our segments is presented in the following table: Investor Services Advisor Services Total Growth Rate2018-2019 2019 2018 2017 Growth Rate2018-2019 2019 2018 2017 Growth Rate2018-2019 2019 2018 2017Year Ended December 31, Net Revenues Net interest revenue 8% $4,685 $4,341 $3,231 24% $1,831 $1,482 $1,051 12% $6,516 $5,823 $4,282Asset management and administration fees 1% 2,289 2,260 2,344 (5)% 922 969 1,048 (1)% 3,211 3,229 3,392Trading revenue (20)% 378 475 408 (17)% 239 288 246 (19)% 617 763 654Other 11% 271 245 217 47% 106 72 73 19% 377 317 290Total net revenues 4% 7,623 7,321 6,200 10% 3,098 2,811 2,418 6% 10,721 10,132 8,618Expenses Excluding Interest 3% 4,284 4,145 3,725 12% 1,589 1,425 1,243 5% 5,873 5,570 4,968Income before taxes on income 5% $3,339 $3,176 $2,475 9% $1,509 $1,386 $1,175 6% $4,848 $4,562 $3,650 Net new client assets (in billions) (1) N/M $115.6 $19.4 $123.7 (6)% $107.2 $114.5 $109.4 66% $222.8 $133.9 $233.1(1) Investor Services includes inflows of $11.1 billion and $34.5 billion in 2019 and 2017, respectively, and outflows of $93.9 billion in 2018 from certain mutual fund clearing services clients.N/M Not meaningful.Investor ServicesTotal net revenues increased by 4% in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to an increase in net interest revenue and higher asset management and administrations fees, partially offset by lower trading revenue. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average investment yields and higher interest-earning assets. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to growing asset balances in advice solutions, partially offset by lower mutual fund and ETF service fee revenue as a result of client cash allocation choices, including reduced usage of Mutual Fund OneSource®. Trading revenue decreased as a result of the elimination of online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options in the fourth quarter of 2019.Expenses excluding interest increased by 3% in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily as a result of higher compensation and benefits due to increased headcount in 2019 and severance charges in the third quarter of 2019, higher occupancy and equipment expenses due to an increase in software maintenance expenses and additional licenses to support growth in the business, and higher amortization of internally developed software associated with continued investments in software and technology enhancements. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in FDIC insurance assessments due to the elimination of the FDIC surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018 and lower travel and entertainment expenses.Total net revenues increased by $1.1 billion, or 18%, in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to an increase in net interest revenue, partially offset by lower asset management and administration fees. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher net interest margins and higher balances of interest-earning assets. Asset management and administration fees decreased primarily due to lower money market fund revenue as a result of transfers to bank sweep, client asset allocation choices, and our 2017 fee reductions. Expenses excluding interest increased by $420 million, or 11%, in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits, technology project spend, and asset management and administration related expenses to support the Company’s expanding client base. Advisor ServicesTotal net revenues increased by 10%, in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to an increase in net interest revenue and other revenue, partially offset by lower asset management and administration fees and lower trading revenue. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average investment yields and higher interest-earning assets. Other revenue increased primarily due to a gain from the sale of a portfolio management and reporting software solution for advisors to Tamarac Inc. in the second quarter of 2019. Asset management and administration fees decreased primarily due to lower sweep money market fund revenue as a result of transfers to bank and broker-dealer sweep, as well as client asset allocation choices, including reduced usage of Mutual Fund OneSource®, partially offset by increased revenue from growing asset balances in purchased money market funds and in other third-party mutual funds and ETFs. Trading revenue decreased as a result of the - 40 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)elimination of online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options in the fourth quarter of 2019.Expenses excluding interest increased by 12% of 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher compensation and benefits due to increased headcount in 2019 and severance charges in the third quarter of 2019, higher professional services expense due to overall growth in the business and investments in projects to further drive efficiency and scale, and higher occupancy and equipment expense due to an increase in software maintenance expenses and additional licenses to support growth in the business.

The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that Schwab will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks.Our risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting, and risk mitigation controls; we use periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The activities and governance that comprise the risk management process are described below.CultureThe Board of Directors has approved an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework that incorporates our purpose, vision, and values, which form the bedrock of our corporate culture and set the tone for the organization.We designed the ERM Framework to enable a comprehensive approach to managing risks encountered by Schwab in its business activities. The framework incorporates key concepts commensurate with the size, risk profile, complexity, and continuing growth of the Company. Risk appetite, which is defined as the amount of risk the Company is willing to accept in pursuit of its corporate strategy, is developed by executive management and approved by the Board of Directors.Risk GovernanceSenior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling risks. The Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior executives from each major business and control function, is responsible for the oversight of risk management. This includes identifying emerging risks, assessing risk management practices and the control environment, reinforcing business accountability for risk management, supervisory controls and regulatory compliance, supporting resource prioritization across the organization, and escalating significant issues to the Board of Directors.We have established risk metrics and reporting that enable measurement of the impact of strategy execution against risk appetite. The risk metrics, with risk limits and tolerance levels, are established for key risk categories by the Global Risk Committee and its functional risk sub-committees.- 41 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)The Chief Risk Officer regularly reports activities of the Global Risk Committee to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. The Board Risk Committee in turn assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to our risk management program, including approving risk appetite statements and related key risk appetite metrics and reviewing reports relating to risk issues from functional areas of corporate risk management, legal, compliance, and internal audit.Functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report to the Global Risk Committee. These sub-committees include the:•Operational Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of and approves operational risk management policies, risk tolerance levels, and operational risk governance processes, and includes sub-committees covering Information Security, Fraud, Third-Party Risk, Data, and Model Governance;•Compliance Risk Committee – provides oversight of compliance risk management programs and policies providing an aggregate view of compliance risk exposure and employee conduct, including subcommittees covering Fiduciary and Conflicts of Interest Risk and International Compliance Risk;•Financial Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of and approves credit, market, liquidity, and capital risk policies, limits, and exposures; and•New Products and Services Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of, and approves corporate policy and procedures relating to, the risk governance of new products and services.Senior management has also created an Incentive Compensation Risk Oversight Committee, which establishes policy and reviews and approves the Annual Risk Assessment of incentive compensation plans, and reports directly to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Company’s compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and corporate risk management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring risk management.In addition, the Disclosure Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.Operational RiskOperational risk arises due to potential inadequacies or failures related to people, internal processes, and systems, or from external events or relationships impacting the Company and/or any of its key business partners and third parties. While operational risk is inherent in all business activities, we rely on a system of internal controls and risk management practices designed to keep operational risk and operational losses within the Company’s risk appetite. We have specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and use control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. Where appropriate, we manage the impact of operational loss and litigation expense through the purchase of insurance. The insurance program is specifically designed to address our key operational risks and to maintain compliance with local laws and regulation.Schwab’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity and resilience of our critical business functions and technology systems. To the extent Schwab experiences business or system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, technological failure, cyber attacks, changes to systems, linkages with third-party systems, and power failures), our business and operations could be negatively impacted. To minimize business interruptions and ensure the capacity to continue operations during an incident regardless of duration, Schwab maintains a backup and recovery infrastructure which includes facilities for backup and communications, a geographically dispersed workforce, and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans and a well-established incident management program.Information Security risk is the risk of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, recording or destruction of the firm’s information or systems. We have designed and implemented an information security program that knits together complementary tools, controls and technologies to protect systems, client accounts and data. We continuously - 42 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)monitor the systems and work collaboratively with government agencies, law enforcement and other financial institutions to address potential threats. We use advanced monitoring systems to identify suspicious activity and deter unauthorized access by internal or external actors. We limit the number of employees who have access to clients’ personal information and internal authentication measures are enforced to protect against the potential for social engineering. All employees who handle sensitive information are trained in privacy and security. Schwab’s conduct and cybersecurity teams monitor activity looking for suspicious behavior. These capabilities allow us to identify and quickly act on any attempted intrusions.Fraud risk arises from attempted or actual theft of financial assets or other property of any client or the Company. Schwab is committed to protecting the Company’s and its clients’ assets from fraud, and complying with all applicable laws and regulations to prevent, detect and report fraudulent activity. Schwab manages fraud risk through policies, procedures and controls. We also take affirmative steps to prevent and detect fraud and report, to appropriate authorities, any known or suspected acts of fraud in accordance with existing laws and requirements.Schwab also faces operational risk when we employ the services of various third parties, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. We manage the exposure to third party risk and promote a culture of resiliency through contractual provisions, control standards, ongoing monitoring of third party performance, and appropriate testing. We also maintain policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with all data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-public client information. We clearly define for employees, contractors, and third parties the expected standards of care for critical and confidential data. We also provide regular training on data security.Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. Models are owned by several business units throughout the organization, and are used for a variety of purposes. Model use includes, but is not limited to, calculating capital requirements for hypothetical stressful environments, estimating interest and credit risk for loans and other balance sheet assets, and providing guidance in the management of client portfolios. We have established a policy to describe the roles and responsibilities of all key stakeholders in model development, management, and use. All models are registered in a centralized database and classified into different risk ratings depending on their potential financial, reputational, or regulatory impact to the Company. The model risk rating determines the scope of model governance activities.Incentive Compensation risk is the potential for adverse consequences resulting from compensation plans that do not balance the execution of our strategy with risk and financial rewards, potentially encouraging imprudent risk-taking by employees. We have implemented risk management processes, including a policy, to identify, evaluate, assess, and manage risks associated with incentive compensation plans and the activities of certain employees, defined as Covered Employees, who have the authority to expose the Company to material amounts of risk. Compliance RiskSchwab faces compliance risk which is the potential exposure to legal or regulatory sanctions, fines or penalties, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, or other regulatory requirements. Among other things, compliance risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of our controls. The Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, including SROs. We manage compliance risk through policies, procedures and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, client privacy, and employment policies. Conduct risk arises from inappropriate, unethical, or unlawful behavior of the Company, its employees or third parties acting on the Company’s behalf that may result in detriment to the Company’s clients, financial markets, the Company, and/or the Company’s employees. We manage this risk through a policy, procedures, a system of internal controls, including personnel monitoring and surveillance. Conduct-related matters are escalated through appropriate channels by the Corporate Responsibility Officer.- 43 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. We manage this risk by establishing policy and procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the policy and procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees.Credit RiskCredit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations. Our exposure to credit risk mainly results from investing activities in our liquidity and investment portfolios, mortgage lending, margin lending and client option and futures activities, pledged asset lending, securities lending activities, and our role as a counterparty in other financial contracts. To manage the risks of such losses, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin, PAL, option, and futures requirements for certain securities and instruments. Liquidity and Investment PortfoliosSchwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios, which include U.S. agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. state and municipal securities, commercial paper, and foreign government agency securities.At December 31, 2019, substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade. U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.Mortgage Lending PortfolioThe bank loan portfolio includes First Mortgages, HELOCs, and other loans. The credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual loan and portfolio reviews. Management regularly reviews asset quality, including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for loan losses.Our residential loan underwriting guidelines include maximum LTV ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan size is conforming or jumbo). Schwab does not originate or purchase residential loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. For more information on credit quality indicators relating to Schwab’s bank loans, see Item 8 – Note 6. Securities and Instrument-Based Lending PortfoliosCollateral arrangements relating to margin loans, PALs, option and futures positions, securities lending agreements, and securities purchased under agreements to resell (resale agreements) include provisions that require additional collateral in the event of market fluctuations. Additionally, for margin loans, PALs, options and futures positions, and securities lending agreements, collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral sufficiently exceeds the credit exposure in order to maintain a fully secured position.- 44 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Other Counterparty ExposuresSchwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab’s clients or a counterparty fail to meet their obligations to Schwab.Market RiskMarket risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by Schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, or market conditions. Schwab is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on our interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of funding sources that finance these assets. To manage interest rate risk, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting limits on net interest revenue risk and economic value of equity risk. To remain within these limits, we manage the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios. Management monitors established guidelines to stay within the Company’s risk appetite.Our measurement of interest rate risk involves assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue or economic value of equity. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies, including changes in asset and liability mix. Financial instruments are also subject to the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument. We are indirectly exposed to option, futures, and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option and futures accounts, securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers, and client securities loaned out as part of the brokerage securities lending activities. Equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity, margin borrowing, and overall client engagement with Schwab. Additionally, we earn mutual fund and ETF service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets. Fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue we earn.Our market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material. Net Interest Revenue SimulationFor our net interest revenue sensitivity analysis, we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulations include all interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities. Key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, repricing of financial instruments, and reinvestment of matured or paid-down securities and loans. Net interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may reprice at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short and long-term interest rates. Interest-earning assets primarily include investment securities, margin loans and bank loans. These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment. Because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans, and control the composition of our investment securities, we have some ability to manage our net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions.- 45 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment. The following table shows the simulated net interest revenue change over the next 12 months beginning December 31, 2019 and 2018 of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period:December 31,20192018Increase of 100 basis points4.8%4.4%Decrease of 100 basis points(7.4)%(4.9)%The year-over-year change in net interest revenue sensitivities reflects lower interest rates across the yield curve, producing higher adverse sensitivity to lower rates as funding costs more rapidly reach rate floor assumptions.In addition to measuring the effect of a gradual 100 basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates, we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel- and non-parallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue.Economic Value of Equity SimulationManagement also uses economic value of equity (EVE) simulations to measure interest rate risk. EVE sensitivity measures the long-term impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates. This analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment. Key assumptions in our EVE calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, term structure models of interest rates, non-maturity deposit behavior, and pricing assumptions.Expected Phase-out of LIBOR The Company has established a firm-wide team to address the likely discontinuation of LIBOR. As part of our efforts, we have inventoried our LIBOR exposures, the largest of which are certain investment securities and loans. In purchasing new investment securities, we ensure that appropriate fall-back language is in the security’s prospectus in the event that LIBOR is unavailable or deemed unreliable. We are updating loan agreements to ensure new LIBOR-based loans adequately provide for an alternative to LIBOR. Furthermore, we plan to phase-out the use of LIBOR as a reference rate in our new lending products before December 2021. Consistent with our “Through Clients’ Eyes” strategy, our focus throughout the LIBOR transition process is to ensure clients are treated fairly and consistently as this major change is occurring in the financial markets. The market transition process has not yet progressed to a point at which the impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements of LIBOR’s discontinuation can be estimated.Liquidity RiskLiquidity risk is the potential that Schwab will be unable to sell assets or meet cash flow obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses.Due to its role as a source of financial strength, CSC’s liquidity needs are primarily driven by the liquidity and capital needs of CS&Co, the capital needs of the banking subsidiaries, principal and interest due on corporate debt, dividend payments on CSC’s preferred stock, and returns of capital to common stockholders. The liquidity needs of CS&Co are primarily driven by client activity including trading and margin borrowing activities and capital expenditures. The capital needs of the banking subsidiaries are primarily driven by client deposits. We have established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies, while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions. We seek to maintain client confidence in the balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the Company to meet its obligations. To this end, we have established limits and contingency funding scenarios to support liquidity levels during both business as usual and stressed conditions.- 46 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)We employ a variety of methodologies to monitor and manage liquidity. We conduct regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific liquidity stress events. Liquidity is also tested at key subsidiaries and results are reported to the Financial Risk Oversight Committee. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the organization and are reviewed with management as appropriate.Primary Funding SourcesSchwab’s primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity which includes bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts. These funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients. Other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, repayments on loans, securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts, repurchase agreements, and cash provided by external financing.To meet daily funding needs, we maintain liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments. For unanticipated liquidity needs, we also maintain a buffer of highly liquid investments, including U.S. Treasury securities.Additional Funding SourcesIn addition to internal sources of liquidity, Schwab has access to external funding. The need for short-term borrowings from external debt facilities arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest-earning investments, movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements and general corporate purposes. We maintain policies and procedures necessary to access funding and test discount window borrowing procedures on a periodic basis.The following table describes external debt facilities available at December 31, 2019:DescriptionBorrowerOutstandingAvailableFederal Home Loan Bank secured credit facility (1)Banking subsidiaries$—$34,207Federal Reserve discount window (2)Banking subsidiaries—8,536Uncommitted, unsecured lines of credit with various external banksCSC, CS&Co—1,642Unsecured commercial paper (3)CSC—750Committed, unsecured credit facility with various external banks (4)CSC—750(1) Amounts available are dependent on the amount of First Mortgages, HELOCs, and the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral. (2) Amounts available are dependent on the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral. (3) CSC has authorization from its Board of Directors to issue Commercial Paper Notes not to exceed $1.5 billion. Management has set a current limit not to exceed the amount of the committed, unsecured credit facility.(4) Other than an overnight borrowing to test availability, this facility was unused during 2019.Our banking subsidiaries maintain secured credit facilities with the FHLB. Amounts available under these facilities are dependent on the value of our First Mortgages, HELOCs, and the fair value of certain of our investment securities that are pledged as collateral. These credit facilities are also available as backup financing in the event the outflow of client cash from the banking subsidiaries’ respective balance sheets is greater than maturities and paydowns on investment securities and bank loans. Our banking subsidiaries also have access to short-term secured funding through the Federal Reserve discount window. Amounts available under the Federal Reserve discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral. CSC has a commercial paper program of which proceeds are used for general corporate purposes. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes may vary, but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue. CSC’s ratings for these short-term borrowings were P1 by Moody’s, A1 by Standard & Poor’s, and F1 by Fitch at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and CSC had no Commercial Paper Notes outstanding at December 31, 2019 or 2018.- 47 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)The financial covenants for the $750 million committed credit facility require CS&Co to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, all bank subsidiaries to be well capitalized, and CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity, adjusted to exclude AOCI. At December 31, 2019, the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was $16.0 billion (CSC’s stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, at December 31, 2019 was $21.7 billion). Management believes these restrictions will not have a material effect on CSC’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements.To partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation, CS&Co has unsecured standby letter of credit agreements (LOCs) with several banks in favor of the Options Clearing Corporation aggregating $20 million at December 31, 2019. There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs during 2019 or 2018. In connection with its securities lending activities, the Company is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. The collateral requirements were satisfied by providing cash as collateral.CSC has a universal automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, which enables it to issue debt, equity, and other securities.Liquidity Coverage RatioAs Schwab’s consolidated balance sheet assets were above $250 billion at December 31, 2018, Schwab became subject to the non-modified LCR rule on April 1, 2019. The Company was in compliance with the LCR rule at December 31, 2019.

These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, Schwab enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements in the ordinary course of business. For information on each of these arrangements, see Item 8 – Note 6, Note 10, Note 12, Note 14, and Note 15. - 49 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Contractual ObligationsSchwab’s principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 are shown in the following table.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENTSchwab seeks to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support execution of our business strategy, including anticipated balance sheet growth, providing financial support to our subsidiaries, and sustained access to the capital markets, while at the same time meeting our regulatory capital requirements and serving as a source of financial strength to our banking subsidiaries. Schwab’s primary sources of capital are funds generated by the operations of subsidiaries and securities issuances by CSC in the capital markets. To ensure that Schwab has sufficient capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values, we have adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios. Our capital management in coming quarters will incorporate preparations for closing the USAA-IMCO transaction, including the allocation of capital to support client cash that will be added to our balance sheet. Internal guidelines are set, for both CSC and its regulated subsidiaries, to ensure capital levels are in line with our strategy and regulatory requirements. Capital forecasts are reviewed monthly at Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee and Financial Risk Oversight Committee meetings. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify potential problems that could impact capital. In addition, we monitor the subsidiaries’ capital levels and requirements. Subject to regulatory capital requirements and any required approvals, any excess capital held by subsidiaries is transferred to CSC in the form of dividends and returns of capital. When subsidiaries have need of additional capital, funds are provided by CSC as equity investments and also as subordinated loans (in a form approved as regulatory capital by regulators) for CS&Co. The details and method used for each cash infusion are based on an analysis of the particular entity’s needs and financing alternatives. The amounts and structure of infusions must take into consideration maintenance of regulatory capital requirements, debt/equity ratios, and equity double leverage ratios.Schwab conducts regular capital stress testing to assess the potential financial impacts of various adverse macroeconomic and company-specific events to which the Company could be subjected. The objective of the capital stress testing is (1) to explore various potential outcomes – including rare and extreme events and (2) to assess impacts of potential stressful outcomes on both capital and liquidity. Additionally, we have a comprehensive Capital Contingency Plan to provide action plans for certain low probability/high impact capital events that the Company might face. The Capital Contingency Plan is issued under the authority of the Financial Risk Oversight Committee and provides guidelines for sustained capital events. It does not specifically address every contingency, but is designed to provide a framework for responding to any capital stress. The results of the stress testing indicate there are two scenarios which could stress the Company’s capital: (1) inflows of balance sheet cash during a period of very low interest rates and (2) outflows of balance sheet cash when other sources of financing are not available and the Company is required to sell assets to fund the flows at a loss. The Capital Contingency Plan is reviewed annually and updated as appropriate.- 50 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)For additional information, see Business – Regulation in Part I, Item 1.Regulatory Capital RequirementsCSC is subject to capital requirements set by the Federal Reserve and is required to serve as a source of strength for our banking subsidiaries and to provide financial assistance if our banking subsidiaries experience financial distress. Schwab is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for CSC of at least 4%; however, management seeks to maintain a ratio of at least 6%. Due to the relatively low risk of our balance sheet assets and risk-based capital ratios at CSC and CSB that are well in excess of regulatory requirements, the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint on CSC’s asset growth.Our banking subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements set by their regulators that are substantially similar to those imposed on CSC by the Federal Reserve. Our banking subsidiaries’ failure to remain well capitalized could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that could have a direct material effect on the banks. Schwab’s principal banking subsidiary, CSB, is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of at least 5% to be well capitalized, but seeks to maintain a ratio of at least 6.25%. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2019, CSB is considered well capitalized.The following table details the capital ratios for CSC consolidated and CSB:December 31,2019 (1) 2018 CSC CSB CSC CSBTotal stockholders’ equity$21,745 $14,832 $20,670 $15,615Less: Preferred Stock2,793 — 2,793 —Common Equity Tier 1 Capital before regulatory adjustments$18,952 $14,832 $17,877 $15,615Less: Goodwill, net of associated deferred tax liabilities$1,184 $13 $1,188 $13Other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities104 — 125 —Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances and deferred tax liabilities4 — 3 1AOCI adjustment (1)— — (252) (231)Common Equity Tier 1 Capital $17,660 $14,819 $16,813 $15,832Tier 1 Capital$20,453 $14,819 $19,606 $15,832Total Capital20,472 14,837 19,628 15,853Risk-Weighted Assets90,512 71,521 95,441 80,513Total Leverage Exposure (1)286,813 216,582 N/A N/ACommon Equity Tier 1 Capital/Risk-Weighted Assets19.5% 20.7% 17.6% 19.7%Tier 1 Capital/Risk-Weighted Assets22.6% 20.7% 20.5% 19.7%Total Capital/Risk-Weighted Assets22.6% 20.7% 20.6% 19.7%Tier 1 Leverage Ratio7.3% 7.1% 7.1% 7.2%Supplementary Leverage Ratio (1)7.1% 6.8% N/A N/A(1) Beginning in 2019, CSC and CSB were required to include all components of AOCI in regulatory capital and report our supplementary leverage ratio, which is calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure includes all on-balance sheet assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures, including unused commitments. Prior to 2019, CSC and CSB elected to opt-out of the requirement to include most components of AOCI in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital; the amounts and ratios for December 31, 2018 are presented on this basis. In the interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules adopted in October 2019, Category III banking organizations such as CSC were given the ability to opt-out of the inclusion of AOCI in regulatory capital, and CSC made this opt-out election effective as of January 1, 2020. See Business – Regulation in Part I, Item 1 for additional information on recently issued rules that impact Schwab’s regulatory capital requirements.N/A Not applicable.CSB is also subject to regulatory requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions. In addition, CSB is required to provide notice to, and may be required to obtain approval from, the OCC and the Federal Reserve to declare dividends to CSC.- 51 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)As a broker-dealer, CS&Co is subject to regulatory requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule, which is intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit CS&Co from paying cash dividends, making unsecured advances and loans to the parent company and employees, and repaying subordinated borrowings from CSC if such payment would result in a net capital amount below prescribed thresholds. At December 31, 2019, CS&Co was in compliance with its net capital requirements.In addition to the capital requirements above, Schwab’s subsidiaries are subject to other regulatory requirements intended to ensure financial soundness and liquidity. See Item 8 – Note 21 for additional information on the components of stockholders’ equity and information on the capital requirements of significant subsidiaries.DividendsSince the initial dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 123 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend rate 24 times, resulting in a 21% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, CSC currently targets its common stock cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income.The Board of Directors of the Company declared quarterly cash dividend increases per common share during 2018 and 2019 as shown below:Date of DeclarationQuarterly Cash Increase Per Common Share % Increase New Quarterly Dividend Per Common ShareJanuary 25, 2018$0.02 25% $0.10July 25, 20180.03 30% 0.13January 30, 20190.04 31% 0.17In addition, on January 30, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a one cent, or 6%, increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.18 per common share.The following table details the CSC cash dividends paid and per share amounts:Year Ended December 31,2019 2018 Cash PaidPer ShareAmount Cash PaidPer ShareAmountCommon Stock$898$0.68 $623$0.46Series A Preferred Stock (1)2870.00 2870.00Series C Preferred Stock (2)3660.00 3660.00Series D Preferred Stock (2)4559.52 4559.52Series E Preferred Stock (3)284,625.00 284,625.00Series F Preferred Stock (4)255,000.00 275,430.56(1) Dividends paid semi-annually until February 1, 2022 and quarterly thereafter.(2) Dividends paid quarterly.(3) Dividends paid semi-annually until March 1, 2022 and quarterly thereafter.(4) Dividends paid semi-annually beginning on June 1, 2018 until December 1, 2027, and quarterly thereafter. Share RepurchasesOn January 30, 2019, CSC publicly announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $4.0 billion of common stock. The authorization does not have an expiration date. During 2019, CSC repurchased 55 million shares of its common stock for $2.2 billion, leaving $1.8 billion remaining on our existing authorization as of December 31, 2019. - 52 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)On October 25, 2018, CSC publicly announced that its Board of Directors terminated the existing two share repurchase authorizations and replaced them with a new authorization to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of common stock. CSC repurchased 22 million shares of its common stock for $1.0 billion in 2018, completing all repurchases under this authorization. FOREIGN EXPOSUREAt December 31, 2019, Schwab had exposure to non-sovereign financial and non-financial institutions in foreign countries, as well as agencies of foreign governments. At December 31, 2019, the fair value of these holdings totaled $6.4 billion, with the top three exposures being to issuers and counterparties domiciled in France at $3.1 billion, the Netherlands at $845 million, and Sweden at $684 million. In addition to the direct holdings in foreign companies and securities issued by foreign government agencies, Schwab had outstanding margin loans to foreign residents of $437 million at December 31, 2019.FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSSchwab uses the market approach to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, and to determine fair value disclosures. See Item 8 – Notes 2 and 16 for more information on our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value.When available, Schwab uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. Quoted prices for investments in exchange-traded securities represent end-of-day close prices published by exchanges. Quoted prices for money market funds and other mutual funds represent reported net asset values. When utilizing market data and bid-ask spread, we use the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices in active markets do not exist, prices are obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets. We generally obtain prices from three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value. Our primary third-party pricing service provides prices for our fixed income investments such as commercial paper; certificates of deposits; U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; corporate debt securities; asset-backed securities; foreign government agency securities; and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Such prices are based on observable trades, broker/dealer quotes, and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar “to-be-issued” securities. We compare the prices obtained from the primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. Schwab does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material differences in the amounts recorded. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we did not adjust prices received from the primary independent third-party pricing service.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe consolidated financial statements of Schwab have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Item 8 – Note 2 contains more information on our significant accounting policies made in connection with its application of these accounting principles.While the majority of the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on Schwab’s financial position and reported financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy.- 53 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Additionally, management has reviewed with the Audit Committee the Company’s significant estimates discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Income TaxesSchwab estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, including federal, state and local domestic jurisdictions, and immaterial amounts owed to several foreign jurisdictions. The estimated income tax expense is reported in the consolidated statements of income in taxes on income. Accrued taxes are reported in other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to future periods. Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. In estimating accrued taxes, we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position. Because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations, interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances. Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be significant to the operating results of the Company. See Item 8 – Note 20 for more information on the Company’s income taxes.Legal and Regulatory ReservesReserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved. See Item 8 – Note 14 for more information on the Company’s contingencies related to legal and regulatory reserves.- 54 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONItem 7A.

316709,SCHW,SCHWAB CHARLES CORP,2021,"Item 7.General Economic and Market RisksThe challenging economic environment triggered by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted and will continue to impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.The COVID‑19 pandemic has adversely impacted the economic environment, leading to lower interest rates across the curve and heightened volatility in the financial markets. These developments have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our net interest revenue, bank deposit account fee revenue, and asset management and administration fees. Additionally, in March 2020, we experienced a significant increase in client cash balances held at our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries which caused our Tier 1 Leverage Ratio to decline into the buffer we maintain between our long-term operating objective and our regulatory requirement. This will limit our ability to return excess capital to stockholders, including through share repurchases, until the ratio returns to higher levels. Credit markets have been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted due to both uncertainty regarding the pandemic’s economic impact and the anticipation that high levels of unemployment will have a significant impact on retail credit and commercial real estate forbearances and delinquencies. We have experienced and may continue to experience higher levels of delinquencies on our portfolios of first mortgages and home equity lines of credit. We also have experienced and may in the future experience material market-driven credit spread movements in certain sectors within our portfolio of investment securities, particularly within our investments in corporate credit securities, asset-backed securities, municipal securities, and commercial mortgage-backed securities. Certain of our client service response and processing times have increased as a result of very high levels of client engagement and our clients have experienced and continue to occasionally experience delays accessing and using our website and mobile applications. Many of our employees and those of our outsourced service providers are working remotely and this has at times contributed to the increase in response and processing times, particularly when we have experienced the temporary loss of services from some of our outsourced service providers. We consider service quality to be an important part of the client experience and our failure to meet client expectations could result in decreased client satisfaction. The COVID-19 pandemic could make the timely achievement of our TD Ameritrade integration milestones more challenging, particularly with regard to technology and systems. These and other impacts of the COVID‑19 pandemic have had and will likely continue to have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section. The extent to which the COVID‑19 pandemic, or the emergence of another wide-spread health crisis, impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including the scope and duration of the outbreak, actions taken by governmental authorities to contain the financial and economic impact and the spread of the outbreak, the effect on our clients, employees, and outsourced service providers, further changes in credit quality and spreads, and reactions in the financial markets.Developments in the business, economic, and geopolitical environment could negatively impact our business.Our business can be adversely affected by the general environment – economic, corporate, securities market, regulatory, and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations, trading activity, interest rates, and overall investor engagement, and are outside of our control. Deterioration in the housing and credit markets, reduction in interest rates, and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact our results of operations and capital resources.- 13 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONThe monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States, have a significant effect on our operating results. Actions taken by the Federal Reserve, including changes in its target funds rate and balance sheet management, are difficult to predict and can affect our net interest revenue and bank deposit account fees. These policies could also have implications for clients’ allocation to cash; higher or lower client cash balances have an impact on our capital requirements as well as liquidity implications if such changes in allocation are sudden.A significant change in client cash allocations could negatively impact our income.We rely heavily on client cash balances to generate revenue. Cash awaiting investment in a portion of our client brokerage accounts is swept to our banking subsidiaries and those bank deposits are then used to extend loans to clients and purchase investment securities. We also sweep a portion of such cash pursuant to the IDA agreement which requires us to maintain a minimum IDA sweep balance. A significant reduction in our clients’ allocation to cash, a change in the allocation of that cash, or a transfer of cash away from the Company, could reduce our income. Significant interest rate changes could affect our profitability.The direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings. A decline in interest rates may have a negative impact on our net interest revenue and our bank deposit account fee revenue. A low interest rate environment may also have a negative impact on our asset management and administration fee revenues when we have to waive a portion of our management fees for certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds in order to continue providing a positive return to clients. The significant reduction in interest rates related to the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a negative impact on our revenue related to interest rates and has caused us to waive management fees for certain funds.Although we believe we are positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment, a rise in interest rates may cause our funding costs to increase if market conditions or the competitive environment induces us to raise our interest rates to avoid losing deposits, or replace deposits with higher cost funding sources without offsetting increases in yields on interest-earning assets can reduce our net interest revenue.The announced phase-out of LIBOR could negatively impact our net interest revenue and will continue to require significant operational work.Certain securities in our investment portfolio and the floating rate loans we offer reference LIBOR as the benchmark rate to determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount. We also use LIBOR in many of our financial models, such as those used for capital stress testing, and to determine the dividend rates for certain of our series of preferred stock which begin to float in 2022 and later. If LIBOR is discontinued as announced, there will be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments and there will continue to be significant work required to transition to using the new benchmark rates and implement necessary changes to our systems and financial models. This could result in different financial performance for previously booked transactions and may impact our existing transaction data, products, systems, operations, and pricing processes. The calculation of interest rates under the replacement benchmarks could also impact our net interest revenue. In addition, LIBOR may perform differently during the phase-out period than in the past which could result in lower interest payments and a reduction in the value of certain securities in our investment portfolio.Compliance RisksExtensive regulation of our businesses may subject us to significant penalties or limitations on business activities.As a participant in the securities, banking, and financial services industries, we are subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws by governmental agencies, supervisory authorities and SROs. The costs and uncertainty related to complying with such regulations continue to increase. These regulations affect our business operations and impose capital, client protection, and market conduct requirements on us as well as restrictions on the activities that we are allowed to conduct. We become subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny as we grow. Regulators have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies and could prevent us from pursuing our business strategy. Regulators could also limit our ability to grow, including adding assets, launching new products, making acquisitions, and undertaking strategic investments. Our banking regulators could require CSC and/or our banking subsidiaries to hold more capital, increase liquidity, or limit their ability to pay dividends or CSC’s ability to repurchase or redeem shares.- 14 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONDespite our efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements, there are a number of risks, particularly in areas where applicable laws or regulations may be unclear or where regulators could revise their previous guidance. Any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by our regulators against us or our affiliates, officers or employees could result in fines, penalties, cease and desist orders, enforcement actions, suspension, disqualification or expulsion, or other disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on our business activities, any of which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.While we maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, violations could occur. In addition, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time. There may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance, including restrictions on certain activities. Such a finding may also damage our reputation and our relationships with our regulators and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities.Legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively affect our business and financial results.New legislation, rules, regulations and guidance, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal, state, foreign and SRO rules, regulations and guidance, including changes relating to mutual funds, standards of conduct with clients, conflicts of interest, and regulatory treatment of deposit accounts, may directly affect our operations and profitability or our specific business lines. Our profitability could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes to the laws governing taxation, electronic commerce, client privacy and security of client data. In addition, the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business we conduct, modifications to our business practices, more stringent capital and liquidity requirements, increased deposit insurance assessments or additional costs and could limit our ability to return capital to stockholders. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to our compliance, risk management, treasury and operations functions.Failure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect our financial condition.CSC, together with its banking, broker-dealer, and FCM/FDM subsidiaries, must meet certain capital and liquidity standards, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about the adequacy of our capital and our internal assessment of our capital needs. The Uniform Net Capital Rule limits the ability of our broker-dealer entities to transfer capital to CSC and other affiliates. New regulatory capital, liquidity, capital planning, and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including paying dividends, stock repurchases, and redemptions, and may require us to increase our capital and/or liquidity or to limit our growth. Failure by either CSC or its banking subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a negative impact on us. In addition, failure by CSC or our banking subsidiaries to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to satisfy their capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer requirements would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital, replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as Tier 1 Capital, or increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity, could require us to liquidate assets, deleverage or otherwise change our business and/or investment plans, which may adversely affect our financial results. Issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders.In January 2021, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule, effective with the 2022 CCAR cycle, making large savings and loan holding companies, including CSC, subject to the CCAR process, which requires submission of an annual capital plan. The plan must include a description of all planned capital actions, including dividends or stock repurchases, over a nine-quarter planning horizon beginning with the first quarter of the calendar year the capital plan is submitted. The rule also imposes a stress capital buffer requirement, floored at 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets, that will replace CSC’s current 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer for our risk-based capital ratios. The stress capital buffer will equal, as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets, the sum of (i) the difference between a firm’s starting common equity Tier 1 capital ratio and the low point under the severely adverse scenario of the Federal Reserve’s supervisory stress test plus (ii) the ratio of the firm’s projected four quarters of common stock dividends for the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon to risk-weighted assets as projected under CCAR. The imposition of a stress capital buffer requirement could change the way in which our minimum risk-based capital ratios are calculated and make us subject to progressively more stringent constraints on capital actions if we approach our minimum ratios. This could lead to restrictions on our ability to pay or increase dividends or otherwise return capital to stockholders.- 15 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONIf CSC reaches $700 billion in total assets or $75 billion in cross-jurisdictional activity, CSC will become subject to more stringent Category II requirements, including annual stress testing, the advanced approaches framework, and the inability to opt out of including AOCI in regulatory capital calculations. When CSC’s weighted short-term wholesale funding is $75 billion or more over the four most recent quarters, CSC will become subject to the full LCR rule and daily liquidity reporting and the full NSFR rule (which goes into effect July 1, 2021). CSC anticipates exceeding the $75 billion threshold as of March 31, 2021. We are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending against claims or proceedings.The financial services industry faces significant litigation and regulatory risks. We are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages. We are also the subject of inquiries, investigations, and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies.Litigation and arbitration claims include those brought by our clients and the clients of third party advisors whose assets are custodied with us. Claims from clients of third party advisors may allege losses due to investment decisions made by the third party advisors or the advisors’ misconduct. Litigation claims also include claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights (e.g., patents). Such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources. If we were found to have infringed on a third-party patent, or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial damages, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology, or providing certain products or services.Actions brought against us may result in settlements, awards, injunctions, fines, penalties or other results adverse to us, including reputational harm. Even if we are successful in defending against these actions, the defense of such matters may result in us incurring significant expenses. A substantial judgment, settlement, fine, or penalty could be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular future period, depending on our results for that period. In market downturns and periods of heightened volatility, the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased. Operational RiskSecurity breaches of our systems, or those of our clients or third parties, may subject us to significant liability and damage our reputation. Our business involves the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential information about our clients and us. Information security risks for financial institutions are increasing, in part because of the use of the internet and mobile technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, activists, hackers and other external parties, including foreign state actors. Our systems and those of other financial institutions have been and will continue to be the target of cyber attacks, malicious code, computer viruses, ransomware, and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, for example, employee misconduct.Given the high volume of transactions that we process, the large number of clients, counterparties and third-party service providers with which we do business and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks, a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected. The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before an investigation is completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known. During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.Security breaches, including breaches of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers or clients, could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject us to significant liability or loss that may not be - 16 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONcovered by insurance, actions by our regulators, damage to our reputation, or a loss of confidence in our security measures which could harm our business. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures.We also face risk related to external fraud involving the misappropriation and use of clients’ user names, passwords or other personal information to gain access to our clients’ financial accounts. This could occur from the compromise of clients’ personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company where clients’ personal information is taken and then made available to fraudsters. Such risk has grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties, including foreign state-sponsored parties. Losses reimbursed to clients under our guarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Technology and operational failures or errors could subject us to losses, litigation, regulatory actions, and reputational damage.We must process, record and monitor a large number of transactions and our operations are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology systems and our ability to make timely enhancements and additions to our systems. System interruptions, errors or downtime can result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to our systems, linkages with third-party systems and power failures and can have a significant impact on our business and operations. Our systems are vulnerable to disruptions from human error, execution errors, errors in models such as those used for asset management, capital planning and management, risk management, stress testing and compliance, employee misconduct, unauthorized trading, external fraud, computer viruses, distributed denial of service attacks, cyber attacks, terrorist attacks, natural disaster, power outage, capacity constraints, software flaws, events impacting key business partners and vendors, and similar events. For example, we and other financial institutions have been the target of various denial of service attacks that have, in certain circumstances, made websites, mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time. It could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to our technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen occurrence, which could affect our ability to process and settle client transactions. Moreover, instances of fraud or other misconduct might also negatively impact our reputation and client confidence in the Company, in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk, oversee operational areas involving risk, and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer unexpected losses, reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors, including those of our vendors or other third parties.While we devote substantial attention and resources to the reliability, capacity and scalability of our systems, extraordinary trading volumes, such as those that have recently occurred, could cause our computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail, affecting our ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients’ orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate. For example, certain of our client service response and processing times have increased as a result of very high levels of client engagement and our clients have experienced, and continue to occasionally experience, delays accessing our systems during periods when there is an unusually high volume of client activity. Disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses, decreased client satisfaction, reputational damage, and regulatory inquiries. We are also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges, clearing houses, market makers, dealers, and other intermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement. System failures and constraints and transaction errors at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices and cancelled orders, cause substantial losses for us and for our clients, and subject us to claims from our clients for damages, and cause reputational harm. Our investment management operations may subject us to fiduciary or other legal liability for client losses.Fund and trust management and administration are complex activities and include functions such as recordkeeping and accounting, security pricing, corporate actions, compliance with investment restrictions, daily net asset value computations, account reconciliations, and required distributions to fund shareholders. Failure to properly perform operational tasks, or the misrepresentation of our services and products could subject us to regulatory sanctions, penalties or litigation and result in reputational damage, liability to clients, and the termination of investment management or administration agreements and the withdrawal of assets under our management.In the management and administration of funds and client accounts, we use quantitative models and other tools and resources to support investment decisions and processes, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, trading and hedging activities and product valuations. Errors in the design, function, or underlying assumptions used in these - 17 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONmodels and tools, particularly if we fail to detect the errors over an extended period, could subject us to claims of a breach of fiduciary duty and potentially large liabilities for make-whole payments, litigation, and/or regulatory fines.We rely on outsourced service providers to perform key functions.We rely on external service providers to perform certain key technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. These service providers face technology, operating, business, and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee, or company information, could cause us to incur losses and could harm our reputation. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider as a result of systems failures, capacity constraints, financial difficulties, natural disasters, public health crises, political developments or for any other reason, and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services, and result in financial losses to us. As a result of certain stay at home restrictions related to the COVID -19 pandemic, we temporarily lost the services from some of our outsourced service providers which contributed to increased client service response and processing times. Switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations.We rely on financial intermediaries to execute and settle client orders. We rely on market makers, dealers, securities exchanges, clearing houses, and other financial intermediaries to execute and settle our clients’ orders. The unwillingness or inability of any of these parties to perform their usual functions coupled with the unavailability of alternative arrangements could result in our clients’ orders not getting executed or settled. This may be due to market volatility, uneconomic trading conditions, capacity constraints, financial constraints, system failures, unanticipated trading halts invoked by securities exchanges, market closures, or other reasons. Our inability to get client orders executed or settled because of the unwillingness or inability of these parties to perform their usual functions could result in client dissatisfaction and reputational harm and expose us to client claims for damages. Liquidity RiskA significant decrease in our liquidity could negatively affect our business as well as reduce client confidence in us.Maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to our business operations, including transaction settlement, custody requirements, and lending commitments, among other liquidity needs. We meet our liquidity needs primarily from working capital and cash generated by client activity as well as external financing. Fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances, as well as market conditions or changes in regulatory treatment of client deposits, may affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs. A reduction in our liquidity position could reduce client confidence in us, which could result in the transfer of client assets and accounts, or could cause us to fail to satisfy our liquidity requirements, including the LCR. In addition, if our broker-dealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines, regulators could limit the subsidiaries’ operations or their ability to upstream funds to CSC, which could reduce CSC’s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt, pay dividends on CSC’s preferred stock, or return capital to common stockholders. In addition, CSC may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries.Factors which may adversely affect our liquidity position include CS&Co and TDAC having temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances, fluctuations in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts, a dramatic increase in our lending activities (including margin, mortgage-related, and personal lending), increased capital requirements, changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations, other regulatory changes, or a loss of market or client confidence in us resulting in unanticipated withdrawals of client funds. As a member firm of securities and derivatives clearing houses, we are required to deposit cash, stock and/or government securities for margin requirements and to clearing funds. The margin requirements may fluctuate significantly from time to time based upon the nature and size of clients’ trading activity and market volatility. For example, as a result of recent market volatility the National Securities Clearing Corporation increased margin requirements for member firms and we were required to deposit additional funds. Clearing houses could also require additional funds from member firms if a clearing member defaults on its obligations to the clearing house in an amount larger than its own margin and clearing fund deposits.When available cash is not sufficient for our liquidity needs, we may seek external financing. During periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets, potential sources of external financing could be reduced, and borrowing costs could increase. Although CSC, CS&Co, and TDAC maintain committed and uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines and CSC has a commercial paper issuance program, as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC which can - 18 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONbe used to sell securities, financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets. In addition, a significant downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets.Credit RiskWe may suffer significant losses from our credit exposures.Our businesses are subject to the risk that a client, counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations, or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate. While we have policies and procedures designed to manage this risk, the policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Our exposure mainly results from margin lending, clients’ options and futures trading, securities lending, mortgage lending, pledged asset lending, our role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities, and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds we sponsor.When clients purchase securities on margin, borrow on lines of credit collateralized by securities, or trade options or futures, we are subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their accounts falls below the amount of clients’ indebtedness. Abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses, especially if there is a lack of liquidity. As a result of our TD Ameritrade acquisition, our margin, options and futures business has materially increased and market liquidity may represent an increased risk.We have exposure to credit risk associated with our investments. Those investments are subject to price fluctuations. Loss of value of securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such loss of value has resulted from a credit loss. The evaluation of whether a credit loss exists is a matter of judgment, which includes the assessment of multiple factors. If management determines that a security’s decline in fair value is the result of a credit loss, an allowance for credit losses on the security will be recorded and a corresponding loss will be recognized in current earnings. Even if a decline in fair value of a security is not determined to have resulted from a credit loss, if we were ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity needs, we would have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time. Our bank loans primarily consist of First Mortgages, HELOCs, and PALs. Increases in delinquency and default rates, housing and stock price declines, increases in the unemployment rate, and other economic factors, including from the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, can result in increases in allowances for credit losses and related credit loss expense, as well as write downs on such loans.Heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments can increase our risk of loss. Examples include:•Large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry;•Mortgage loans and HELOCs to banking clients which are secured by properties in the same geographic region; and•Client margins, options or futures, pledged assets, and securities lending activities collateralized by or linked to securities of a single issuer, index, or industry.We sponsor a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds. Although we have no obligation to do so, we may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit, liquidity or other support to our funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity. Such support could cause us to take significant charges, could reduce our liquidity and, in certain situations, could, with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds, result in us having to consolidate one or more funds in our financial statements. If we choose not to provide credit, liquidity or other support in such a situation, we could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected.Risks Related to Our Acquisition of TD AmeritradeWe may fail to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the TD Ameritrade acquisition, which could adversely affect the value of our stock.The success of our TD Ameritrade acquisition will depend, in significant part, on our ability to realize the anticipated cost - 19 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONsavings and other benefits from integrating the businesses of Schwab and TD Ameritrade. Our ability to realize these anticipated cost savings and other benefits is subject to certain risks. If we are not able to successfully combine the businesses of Schwab and TD Ameritrade within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected, the combined business may not perform as expected and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key Schwab or TD Ameritrade employees, the loss of clients, the disruption of either company’s or both companies’ ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated.Most of the integration planning and execution work is currently being done remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The inability to work in-person and on-site with information technology and management oversight could make some of the integration work more challenging, particularly with regard to technology. We will need to hire a significant number of technology personnel and contract staff and rely on a number of critical technology vendors in order to complete the integration work relating to technology platforms and systems within the target timeframe. In addition, we may experience delays in acquiring the technology and infrastructure components needed for the integration due to pandemic-related supply chain disruptions. We also have been experiencing high levels of trading volume which, if sustained, may require us to increase the capacity in our integration technology build-outs. In addition, at times the attention of certain members of our management and other resources may be diverted from integration work to critical day-to-day business operations. We may also encounter challenges integrating TD Ameritrade technologies into Schwab platforms. Any of these factors could make timely achievement of integration milestones more challenging, particularly with regard to technology and systems. We will continue to incur significant integration costs in connection with the TD Ameritrade acquisition. We will continue to incur significant non-recurring costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans with respect to combining the operations of Schwab and TD Ameritrade, including technology-related, workforce and facilities consolidation costs. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies’ businesses. We may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other employees following completion of the acquisition.Uncertainty about the effect of the acquisition on Schwab and TD Ameritrade employees may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the integration process, as employees of Schwab and TD Ameritrade may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined business. If employees of Schwab or TD Ameritrade depart, the integration of the companies may be more difficult and the combined business may be harmed. Furthermore, we may have to incur significant costs in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent relating to the businesses of Schwab or TD Ameritrade, and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may be adversely affected. In addition, there could be disruptions to or distractions for the workforce and management associated with integrating employees into Schwab. The TD Ameritrade acquisition may not be accretive to our earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Based on the anticipated synergies between Schwab and TD Ameritrade, we expect the acquisition to be accretive to our earnings per share in the third year following completion of the merger. However, future events and conditions could reduce or delay the accretion that is currently projected or result in the acquisition being dilutive to our earnings per share, including adverse changes in market conditions, additional transaction and integration related costs and other factors such as the failure to realize some or all of the benefits anticipated in the acquisition. Any dilution of, reduction in, or delay of any accretion to, our earnings per share could cause the price of shares of our common stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate. Other Business RisksPotential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on our financial position.We evaluate potential strategic transactions, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions. Any such transaction could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The process of - 20 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONevaluating, negotiating, effecting, and integrating any such strategic transaction may divert management’s attention from other business concerns, and might cause the loss of key clients, employees, and business partners. Moreover, integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties, including the need to integrate operational, financial, and management information systems and management controls, integrate relationships with clients and business partners, and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas. The integration process could result in the disruption of ongoing businesses or changes to inconsistent standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, employees, outsourced service providers and vendors. In addition, an acquisition may cause us to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings or require the amortization of a large amount of acquired intangible assets. Further, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition in a timely manner or at all (including without limitation the recent acquisition of TD Ameritrade), and any future acquisition could be dilutive to our current stockholders’ percentage ownership or to earnings per common share (EPS).Our acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in the business, operations or financial condition of the entity or part of an entity being acquired or sold. To the extent we enter into an agreement to buy or sell an entity or part of an entity, there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected, or at all. If a material transaction does not close, our stock price could decline.Our industry is highly competitive and characterized by aggressive price competition.We operate in a highly competitive environment with a broad array of competitors from large integrated banks to venture-capital backed private companies. We continually monitor our pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjust interest rates on deposits and loans, fees for advisory services, expense ratios on mutual funds and ETFs, trade commission rates, and other pricing and incentives to sustain our competitive position. Increased price competition from other financial services firms to attract clients, such as reduced commissions, higher deposit rates, reduced mutual fund or ETF expense ratios, or the increased use of incentives, could impact our results of operations and financial condition.We face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees.The market for qualified personnel in our business is highly competitive. At various times, different functions and roles are in especially high demand in the market, compelling us to pay more to attract talent. Our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs.We need to hire a significant number of technology personnel and contract staff to complete the TD Ameritrade integration work within the target timeframe. Demand for skilled technology professionals is high and we may experience delays in hiring the appropriate skilled resources.Our stock price has fluctuated historically, and may continue to fluctuate.Our stock price can be volatile. Among the factors that may affect the volatility of our stock price are the following:•Our exposure to changes in interest rates;•Speculation in the investment community or the press about, or actual changes in, our competitive position, organizational structure, executive team, operations, financial condition, financial reporting and results, expense discipline, strategic transactions, or progress on achieving the expected benefits from our TD Ameritrade acquisition;•The announcement of new products, services, acquisitions, or dispositions by us or our competitors; •Increases or decreases in revenue or earnings, changes in earnings estimates by the investment community, and variations between estimated financial results and actual financial results; and•Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by large stockholders.Changes in the stock market generally, or as it concerns our industry, as well as geopolitical, corporate, regulatory, business, and economic factors may also affect our stock price.- 21 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONFuture sales of CSC’s equity securities may adversely affect the market price of CSC’s common stock and result in dilution.CSC’s certificate of incorporation authorizes CSC’s Board of Directors, among other things, to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities, without stockholder approval.CSC may issue additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital or for other purposes. The issuance of any additional equity or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of CSC’s common stock and may adversely affect the market price of CSC’s common stock.Our ongoing relationships with TD Bank and its affiliates could have a negative impact on us. Although our acquisition of TD Ameritrade was structured such that completion of the merger would not result in CSC either (i) being deemed to be “controlled” by TD Bank (as that term is interpreted by the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act or HOLA) or (ii) being deemed to be in “control” of any of TD Bank’s depository institutions, changes in circumstances could trigger presumptions of control under the Federal Reserve’s regulations. This could occur if TD Bank and its affiliates own more than 9.9% of Schwab common stock, as interpreted in accordance with the applicable rules of the Federal Reserve. While the Stockholder Agreement between CSC and TD Bank prohibits TD Bank and its affiliates from exceeding the 9.9% threshold, it could happen unintentionally. This presumption of control could also be triggered if the revenue generated to either us or to any of the TD Bank depository institutions exceeds a certain percentage. The Stockholder Agreement contains provisions to address such situations.Under the IDA agreement, we are not permitted to reduce the deposit balances swept to the TD Depository Institutions until June 30, 2021 and thereafter only by a set amount during each 12-month period, subject to certain limitations including only moving IDA balances designated as floating-rate obligations and maintaining a minimum IDA sweep balance through 2031. The bank deposit account fee revenue that we earn related to the IDA agreement may be less than the net interest revenue that we could have earned if the deposit balances were swept to our banking subsidiaries rather than the TD Depository Institutions. When we are permitted to reduce the IDA balances, we can only move the balances to our banking subsidiaries if we have sufficient capital. In addition, in a low rate environment it is possible that the sweep arrangement fee computation could result in a negative amount that we would be required to pay the TD Depository Institutions, resulting in us having an expense rather than revenue.

We believe that metrics relating to net new and total client assets, as well as client cash levels and utilization of advisory services, offer perspective on our business momentum and client engagement. Data on new and total client brokerage accounts provides additional perspective on our ability to attract and retain new business. Total net revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin, EPS, return on average common stockholders’ equity, and the Consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio provide broad indicators of Schwab’s overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns. Total expenses excluding interest as a percentage of average client assets is a measure of operating efficiency. Our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations and financial condition of TD Ameritrade beginning on October 6, 2020, as discussed below.

The impact of COVID-19, along with social and political turmoil, created an unprecedented combination of personal and macroeconomic challenges for our clients, employees, and stockholders. While working through these challenges, we progressed in advancing the Company’s strategic goals to drive scale, monetization, and segmentation in ways that benefit our clients. Among the Company’s key accomplishments in 2020 were the successful completion of the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and three other strategic acquisitions, as discussed below. The COVID-19 pandemic’s rapid escalation in early 2020 was accompanied by volatile equity markets and the Federal Reserve’s further easing of monetary policy. As the year progressed, government aid packages and vaccine developments helped settle the markets, with the S&P 500® erasing its pandemic-related losses to finish up 16% for the year. Throughout 2020, client engagement with the financial markets greatly increased over the prior year, as client trading activity reached record levels. Core net new assets totaled $281.9 billion in 2020, representing our third consecutive year of over $200 billion. Total client assets reached $6.69 trillion spread across 29.6 million brokerage accounts, up 66% and 140%, respectively, from year-end 2019.Against this backdrop, Schwab’s net income totaled $3.3 billion, down $405 million, or 11% from 2019, while the Company produced diluted EPS of $2.12, representing a decrease of 21% relative to 2019. Adjusted diluted EPS (1), which excludes acquisition and integration-related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and related income tax effects, amounted to $2.45 in 2020, down 9% from $2.70 in 2019. Total net revenues reached $11.7 billion for the year, increasing 9% from 2019. During March 2020, the Federal Reserve acted to support the economy by cutting the Fed Funds rate from 1.75% to near zero and announcing significant asset purchase programs. Mortgage refinancing activity subsequently accelerated, and our net interest margin was impacted by both significantly lower interest rates and increased prepayments of mortgage-backed securities held in our investment portfolio. Strong growth in interest-earning assets via client inflows and allocation decisions, as well as our acquisitions of TD Ameritrade and assets of USAA-IMCO, helped limit the decrease in net interest revenue to 6%, resulting in a full-year 2020 total of $6.1 billion. Growing balances in advisory solutions and a rebound in equity markets in 2020 helped drive an 8% increase in asset management and administration fees, which totaled $3.5 billion in 2020. Record client trading activity and the addition of TD Ameritrade in the fourth quarter contributed to an 88% increase in trading revenue, which reached $1.4 billion for the year, more than offsetting a full-year impact of the commission reductions implemented in the fourth quarter of 2019. With the TD Ameritrade acquisition, our fourth quarter 2020 results included bank deposit account fee revenue for the first time, which totaled $355 million for the period from October 6, through December 31, 2020.Total expenses excluding interest increased 26% in 2020 to $7.4 billion, which included significant costs related to our acquisitions. With the completion of four acquisitions during the year, acquisition and integration-related costs totaled $442 million in 2020, representing a significant increase from the $26 million incurred in 2019. Amortization of acquired intangible assets also increased, totaling $190 million in 2020 compared with $27 million in 2019. Exclusive of these items (1), adjusted total expenses increased 16% from 2019. Return on average common stockholders’ equity was 9% in 2020, down from 19% in 2019. Return on tangible common equity (1) (ROTCE) was 15% in 2020, down from 21% in 2019. The 2020 decreases in both return on average common stockholders’ equity and ROTCE are due to lower net income as well as significantly higher balances of common equity due to the TDA acquisition and higher AOCI in 2020, driven by unrealized gains in our AFS investment portfolio.(1) Adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted total expenses, and return on tangible common equity are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results.- 33 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Throughout 2020, the Company maintained its disciplined approach to capital management, helping sustain significant balance sheet growth. Schwab’s consolidated total assets ended 2020 at $549 billion, representing growth of $255 billion, or 87%, from year-end 2019, reflecting both our organic growth as well as the acquisitions of TD Ameritrade and the assets of USAA-IMCO. Through offerings in April and December, the Company issued preferred stock totaling approximately $5 billion in 2020, bringing total preferred stock to approximately $7.7 billion, or approximately 25% of Tier 1 Capital at December 31, 2020. The Company’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 6.3% at December 31, 2020.Business and Asset AcquisitionsTD AmeritradeEffective October 6, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade. TD Ameritrade provides securities brokerage services, including trade execution, clearing services, and margin lending, through its broker-dealer subsidiaries; and futures and foreign exchange trade execution services through its FCM and FDM subsidiary. At the time of closing, TD Ameritrade had approximately $1.6 trillion in client assets and approximately 14.5 million brokerage accounts. In exchange for each share of TD Ameritrade common stock, TD Ameritrade stockholders received 1.0837 shares of CSC common stock, except for TD Bank and its affiliates which received a portion in nonvoting common stock. In connection with the transaction, Schwab issued approximately 586 million common shares to TD Ameritrade stockholders consisting of approximately 509 million shares of common stock and 77 million shares of nonvoting common stock. Upon completion of the acquisition, TDA Holding became a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSC. See Item 8 – Note 3 for more information.For the period of October 6, through December 31, 2020, total net revenues and total expenses excluding interest attributable to TD Ameritrade were approximately $1.7 billion and $943 million, respectively. TD Ameritrade’s primary sources of revenues include trading revenue, bank deposit account fees, net interest revenue, and asset management and administration fees. Bank deposit account fee revenue is primarily earned through the Company’s IDA agreement. TD Ameritrade’s assets and liabilities have been revalued and recorded at their provisional estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition. The integration of TD Ameritrade’s operations is expected to occur over 18 to 36 months from the date of acquisition, and the Company expects to continue to incur significant acquisition and integration-related costs and integration-related capital expenditures throughout the integration process. Such costs have included and are expected to continue to include professional fees, such as legal, advisory, and accounting fees, and compensation and benefits expenses for employees and contractors involved in the integration work, costs for technology enhancements, as well as exit and other related costs incurred to attain anticipated synergies. Such costs include employee compensation and benefits, including severance pay, other termination benefits and retention costs, as well as costs related to facility closures, including accelerated depreciation or impairments of assets in those locations. The Company currently estimates that total acquisition and integration-related costs and capital expenditures related to the integration of TD Ameritrade will be approximately $1.6 billion. The Company is in the early stages of integration, and our estimates of the nature, amounts, and timing of recognition of acquisition and integration-related costs are subject to change based on a number of factors, including the expected duration and complexity of the integration process and the heightened uncertainty of the current economic environment. More specifically, factors that could cause variability in our expected acquisition and integration-related costs include the level of employee attrition, workforce redeployment from eliminated positions into open roles, changes in the levels of client activity, as well as increased real estate-related exit cost variability due to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Acquisition and integration-related costs, which includes related exit costs, for all of our acquisitions completed in 2020 totaled $442 million, and the Company expects to incur a roughly consistent amount in 2021 related primarily to continued work on the integration of TD Ameritrade. While inclusion of TD Ameritrade’s operating costs and continued acquisition and integration-related costs will increase the Company’s total expenses excluding interest in 2021 and going forward, we expect to realize cost synergies through integration. Over the course of the integration, we expect to realize annualized cost synergies of between $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion, with one-quarter to one-third on an annualized run-rate basis expected by the end of the first year following acquisition. Estimated timing and amounts of synergy realization are subject to change as we progress in the integration.

Along with the asset purchase agreement, the companies entered into a long-term referral agreement that makes Schwab the exclusive provider of wealth management and investment brokerage services for USAA members. The USAA-IMCO acquisition has added scale to the Company’s operations through the addition of 1.1 million brokerage and managed portfolio accounts with approximately $80 billion in client assets at the acquisition date. The transaction also provides Schwab the opportunity to further expand our client base by serving USAA’s members through the long-term referral agreement. See Item 8 – Note 3 for more information on the USAA-IMCO acquisition.OtherDuring the second quarter of 2020 the Company completed its acquisition of technology and intellectual property of Motif, a financial technology company. The Motif assets help us build on our existing capabilities and help accelerate our development of thematic and direct index investing for Schwab’s retail investors and RIA clients. On July 1, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of Wasmer Schroeder, which adds established strategies and new separately managed account offerings to our existing fixed income lineup.2019 Compared to 2018 Schwab delivered solid financial results in 2019 while taking significant steps to further enhance our offer to clients and help position the Company to build value for our stakeholders over the long-term. Throughout 2019, investor sentiment reflected a complex market environment that included global trade negotiations and an uncertain domestic economic outlook. The Federal Reserve ended up cutting the federal funds target interest rate three times in 2019, in a reversal of the increases seen in 2018. At the same time, stocks continued to rise, with the S&P 500® increasing 29% during 2019. Core net new assets totaled $211.7 billion for 2019, representing an organic growth rate of 7% and our second consecutive year over $200 billion. Clients opened 1.6 million new brokerage accounts in 2019, while active brokerage accounts grew 6% to 12.3 million. Our success in asset gathering combined with strong market returns drove total client assets to reach $4.04 trillion at December 31, 2019, closing the year up 24%. Company actions to benefit clients and build long-term value during 2019 included the elimination of online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options, which became effective October 7, 2019. The Company also announced two significant acquisitions during 2019. In July 2019, the Company agreed to acquire assets of USAA-IMCO and agreed to enter into a long-term referral agreement. In late November 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire TD Ameritrade. Against the backdrop of the more challenging than expected macroeconomic environment and our own pricing decisions, Schwab’s net income totaled $3.7 billion in 2019, an increase of $197 million, or 6%. Diluted EPS grew to $2.67, representing an increase of 9% from 2018.Total net revenues reached $10.7 billion, up 6% in 2019. Net interest revenue increased 12% in 2019 to $6.5 billion, driven by higher average investment yields and also by an increase in client cash balances held at our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries. While trading revenue declined 17% to $752 million due to our pricing actions, asset management and administration fees remained essentially flat with 2018 at $3.2 billion, decreasing 1%. Growing enrollment in advice solutions, along with rising balances in other third-party mutual funds, helped to largely offset declines in Mutual Fund OneSource® and lower sweep money market fund revenue due to transfers of sweep money market funds to our balance sheet in 2018 and early 2019. Total expenses excluding interest increased 5% in 2019 to $5.9 billion, which included $62 million in severance charges associated with a 3% reduction in our workforce and $25 million in costs relating to the announced acquisitions of assets of USAA-IMCO and TD Ameritrade. The Company’s focus on driving efficiency while managing spending in a disciplined manner helped us maintain a ratio of expenses to client assets of 16 bps for 2019. Balancing long-term profitability with reinvesting for growth, we achieved a 45.2% pre-tax profit margin and a 19% return on equity in 2019, representing our second consecutive year of at least 45% and 19%, respectively.- 35 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Disciplined balance sheet management remained core to our strategy as we continued to support business growth and meaningful capital returns across a range of conditions. In early 2019, the Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend 31% to $0.17 per share and authorized the repurchase of up to $4.0 billion of common stock; during 2019 we repurchased 55 million shares for $2.2 billion under this authorization. As of December 31, 2019, our balance sheet assets were $294 billion, down 1% from December 31, 2018; our Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 7.3% at year-end 2019. RESULTS OF OPERATIONSTotal Net RevenuesTotal net revenues of $11.7 billion and $10.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, represented growth of 9% and 6% from the prior periods. The 2020 increase was due to our acquisition of TD Ameritrade, which contributed approximately $1.7 billion of total net revenues from October 6, through December 31, 2020. Total net revenues increased in 2019 primarily due to growth in net interest revenue.Year Ended December 31,202020192018Growth Rate2019-2020Amount% ofTotal NetRevenuesAmount% ofTotal NetRevenuesAmount% ofTotal NetRevenuesNet interest revenueInterest revenue(14)%$6,531 56 %$7,580 71 %$6,680 66 %Interest expense(61)%(418)(4)%(1,064)(10)%(857)(9)%Net interest revenue(6)%6,113 52 %6,516 61 %5,823 57 %Asset management and administration feesMutual funds, ETFs, and collective trust funds (CTFs) (1)1 %1,770 15 %1,747 16 %1,837 18 %Advice solutions20 %1,443 12 %1,198 11 %1,139 11 %Other (1)(2)%262 3 %266 3 %253 3 %Asset management and administration fees8 %3,475 30 %3,211 30 %3,229 32 %Trading revenueCommissions35 %739 6 %549 5 %685 7 %Order flow revenue (2)N/M621 6 %135 1 %139 1 %Principal transactions(18)%56 — 68 1 %78 1 %Trading revenue (2)88 %1,416 12 %752 7 %902 9 %Bank deposit account feesN/M355 3 %— — — — Other (2)37 %332 3 %242 2 %178 2 %Total net revenues9 %$11,691 100 %$10,721 100 %$10,132 100 %(1) Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, a change was made to move CTFs from other asset management and administration fees.

Percentage changes greater than 200% are presented as not meaningful.Net Interest RevenueSchwab’s primary interest-earning assets include cash and cash equivalents; cash and investments segregated; margin loans, which constitute the majority of receivables from brokerage clients; investment securities; and bank loans. Revenue on interest-earning assets is affected by various factors, such as the composition of assets, prevailing interest rates and spreads at the time of origination or purchase, changes in interest rates on floating rate securities and loans, and changes in prepayment levels for mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and loans. Fees earned and expenses incurred on securities lending and borrowing activities are conducted by our broker-dealer subsidiaries using assets held in client brokerage accounts.Schwab’s interest-bearing liabilities include bank deposits, payables to brokerage clients, short-term borrowings (e.g., Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances, commercial paper), and long-term debt. Non-interest-bearing funding sources include stockholders’ equity, certain client cash balances, and other miscellaneous liabilities. - 36 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Schwab establishes the rates paid on client-related liabilities, and management expects that it will generally adjust the rates paid on these liabilities at some fraction of any movement in short-term rates. Schwab deploys the funds from these sources into the assets outlined above. We do not use short-term, wholesale borrowings to support our long-term investment activity, but may use such funding, including FHLB advances or commercial paper, for short-term liquidity purposes or to provide temporary funding (e.g., for investment purchases) ahead of anticipated balance sheet deposit growth.In order to keep interest-rate sensitivity within established limits, management actively monitors and adjusts interest-rate sensitivity through changes in the balance sheet, primarily by adjusting the composition of our banking subsidiaries’ investment portfolios. As Schwab builds its client base, we attract new client sweep cash, which is a primary driver of funding balance sheet growth. Late in the first quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds target overnight rate from 1.75% to near zero; on the longer-end of the curve, the 10-year Treasury rate declined by over 120 basis points. Lower interest rates across maturities persisted from the end of the first quarter through the end of 2020, while credit spreads also compressed. Moreover, changes in the economic environment throughout 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic drove significantly higher levels of client cash sweep balances. As these balances rapidly accumulated in the first quarter of 2020, the Company initially placed a substantial amount in excess reserves held at the Federal Reserve, and subsequently deployed a significant amount of this cash build-up throughout 2020. AFS securities purchases in 2020 totaled $202.2 billion. These purchases were made at rates below the average yield on the existing AFS portfolio due to the current low interest rate environment.Schwab’s acquisition of TD Ameritrade, effective October 6, 2020, provides additional interest-earning assets and liabilities. For Schwab’s 2020 full-year averages, TD Ameritrade contributed approximately $12.0 billion of average interest-earning assets and $9.6 billion of average interest-bearing liabilities. TD Ameritrade’s interest-earning assets consist primarily of receivables from brokerage clients, cash and investments segregated, cash and cash equivalents, and AFS securities. TD Ameritrade’s interest-bearing liabilities consist primarily of payables to brokerage clients and long-term debt. See Item 8 – Note 3 for additional information on the TD Ameritrade acquisition including the provisional fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.- 37 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)The following table presents net interest revenue information corresponding to interest-earning assets and funding sources on the consolidated balance sheets:Year Ended December 31,202020192018AverageBalanceInterestRevenue/ExpenseAverage Yield/RateAverageBalanceInterest Revenue/ExpenseAverage Yield/RateAverageBalanceInterest Revenue/ExpenseAverage Yield/RateInterest-earning assetsCash and cash equivalents$39,052 $120 0.30 %$23,512 $518 2.17 %$17,783 $348 1.93 %Cash and investments segregated34,100 141 0.41 %15,694 345 2.17 %11,461 206 1.78 %Receivables from brokerage clients28,058 848 2.97 %19,270 821 4.20 %19,870 830 4.12 %Available for sale securities (1,2)253,555 4,537 1.78 %58,181 1,560 2.67 %54,542 1,241 2.26 %Held to maturity securities (2)— — — 134,708 3,591 2.65 %131,794 3,348 2.53 %Bank loans20,932 545 2.60 %16,832 584 3.47 %16,554 559 3.37 %Total interest-earning assets375,697 6,191 1.64 %268,197 7,419 2.75 %252,004 6,532 2.57 %Securities lending revenue (3)334 147 118 Other interest revenue (3)6 14 30 Total interest-earning assets (4)$375,697 $6,531 1.73 %$268,197 $7,580 2.80 %$252,004 $6,680 2.63 %Funding sourcesBank deposits$291,206 $93 0.03 %$212,605 $700 0.33 %$199,139 $545 0.27 %Payables to brokerage clients46,347 12 0.02 %24,353 79 0.33 %21,178 56 0.27 %Short-term borrowings (5)89 — 0.20 %17 — 2.36 %3,359 54 1.59 %Long-term debt8,992 289 3.22 %7,199 258 3.58 %5,423 190 3.50 %Total interest-bearing liabilities346,634 394 0.11 %244,174 1,037 0.42 %229,099 845 0.37 %Non-interest-bearing funding sources (4)29,063 24,023 22,905 Securities lending expense (3)33 38 18 Other interest expense (3)(9)(11)(6)Total funding sources (4)$375,697 $418 0.11 %$268,197 $1,064 0.39 %$252,004 $857 0.34 %Net interest revenue$6,113 1.62 %$6,516 2.41 %$5,823 2.29 %(1) Amounts have been calculated based on amortized cost.(2) On January 1, 2020, the Company transferred all of its investment securities designated as held to maturity (HTM) to the AFS category, as described in Item 8 – Note 6.(3) Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, securities lending revenue has been reclassified from broker-related receivables and other revenue. Securities lending expense has been reclassified from other expense. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect this change.(4) Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, broker-related receivables were removed from total interest earning assets and netted against non-interest-bearing funding sources, resulting in an immaterial reduction to total interest-earning assets and total funding sources. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect this change.(5) Interest revenue or expense was less than $500 thousand in the period or periods presented.Net interest revenue decreased $403 million or 6%, in 2020 from 2019, due primarily to lower average investment yields partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets. Accelerated premium amortization on debt securities in 2020 also contributed to the reduction in net interest revenue, as the decline in long-term interest rates in 2020 resulted in higher prepayments of mortgage-related debt securities. TD Ameritrade contributed approximately $443 million of net interest revenue from October 6, through December 31, 2020. Average interest-earning assets for 2020 were higher by 40%, compared to 2019. This increase in average interest-earning assets was primarily driven by higher client cash balances in bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients, due to higher client cash allocations and our acquisitions of TD Ameritrade and assets of USAA-IMCO. Our net interest margin decreased to 1.62% in 2020, from 2.41% in 2019. This decrease was driven primarily by lower yields received on interest-earning assets due largely to the Federal Reserve’s 2019 and 2020 interest rate reductions as well as higher premium amortization on mortgage-related debt securities. Due to the low interest rate environment, purchases of investment securities in 2020 were made at rates below the average yield on the existing AFS portfolio, which negatively impacted our net interest margin. The amount of any further net interest margin compression and resulting net interest - 38 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)revenue is dependent on a number of factors, including changes to LIBOR, premium amortization, reinvestment rates, and growth in client cash balances.Net interest revenue increased $693 million, or 12%, in 2019 from 2018, due to higher average investment yields and growth in interest earning assets. Our net interest margin improved 12 basis points to 2.41% in 2019 from 2018, driven primarily by higher average yields received on interest-earning assets in 2019 due largely to the net impact of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases in 2018 and decreases in the third and fourth quarters of 2019. The increase in average yields on interest-earning assets was partially offset by higher average interest rates paid on bank deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. Portfolio adjustments made in 2019 to hold a higher percentage of fixed-rate, longer duration investments helped to moderate the impact of the declining rate environment on our net interest margin. Average interest-earning assets grew 6% from 2018 to 2019, primarily driven by higher bank deposits due to transfers from sweep money market funds to bank sweep, as well as higher client cash balances. Asset Management and Administration FeesAsset management and administration fees include mutual fund, ETF, and CTF service fees and fees for other asset-based financial services provided to individual and institutional clients. Schwab earns mutual fund, ETF, and CTF service fees for shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. Asset management and administration fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in these funds and do not include securities lending revenues earned by proprietary mutual funds, ETFs, and CTFs, as those amounts, net of program fees, are credited to the fund shareholders. Proprietary CTFs may, but generally do not, directly participate in securities lending. The fair values of client assets included in proprietary and third-party mutual funds, ETFs, and CTFs are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data.We also earn asset management fees for advice solutions, which include managed portfolios, specialized strategies, and customized investment advice. Other asset management and administration fees include various asset-based fees such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, mutual fund clearing fees, and non-balance based service and transaction fees.Asset management and administration fees attributable to TD Ameritrade are primarily earned on client assets invested in money market mutual funds and other mutual funds, as well as advice solutions. Asset management and administration fees vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity. - 39 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)The following table presents asset management and administration fees, average client assets, and average fee yields:Year Ended December 31,202020192018AverageClientAssetsRevenueAverageFeeAverageClientAssetsRevenueAverageFeeAverageClientAssetsRevenueAverageFeeSchwab money market funds before fee waivers$200,119 $605 0.30 %$173,558 $525 0.30 %$141,018 $568 0.40 %Fee waivers(127)— — Schwab money market funds200,119 478 0.24 %173,558 525 0.30 %141,018 568 0.40 %Schwab equity and bond funds, ETFs, and CTFs (1)301,598 300 0.10 %267,213 298 0.11 %222,830 302 0.14 %Mutual Fund OneSource® and other non- transaction fee funds192,464 599 0.31 %191,552 606 0.32 %210,429 680 0.32 %Other third-party mutual funds and ETFs (2,3)525,379 393 0.07 %478,037 318 0.07 %328,150 287 0.09 %Total mutual funds, ETFs, and CTFs (1,4)$1,219,560 1,770 0.15 %$1,110,360 1,747 0.16 %$902,427 1,837 0.20 %Advice solutions (4)Fee-based$306,010 1,443 0.47 %$246,888 1,198 0.49 %$227,790 1,139 0.50 %Non-fee-based73,161 — — 70,191 — — 62,813 — — Total advice solutions$379,171 1,443 0.38 %$317,079 1,198 0.38 %$290,603 1,139 0.39 %Other balance-based fees (1,5)451,350 208 0.05 %432,613 216 0.05 %383,050 206 0.05 %Other (6)54 50 47 Total asset management and administration fees$3,475 $3,211 $3,229 (1) Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, a change was made to move CTFs from other balance-based fees.

These increases were partially offset by the effect of money market fund fee waivers due to declining portfolio yields. Asset management and administration fees attributable to TD Ameritrade were approximately $131 million from October 6, through December 31, 2020. The amount of fee waivers in coming quarters is dependent on a variety of factors, including the level of short-term interest rates and client preferences across our money market fund line-up. Asset management and administration fees decreased by $18 million, or 1%, in 2019 from 2018, primarily due to lower sweep money market fund revenue as a result of transfers to bank and broker-dealer sweep in 2018 and early 2019, as well as client asset allocation choices including reduced usage of Mutual Fund OneSource®. Part of the decline was offset by revenue from growing asset balances in purchased money market funds, other third-party mutual funds and ETFs, and in advice solutions. - 40 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)The following table presents a roll forward of client assets for the Schwab money market funds, Schwab equity and bond funds, ETFs, and CTFs, and Mutual Fund OneSource® and other non-transaction fee (NTF) funds.

Prior periods have been reclassified to reflect this change. Trading RevenueTrading revenue includes commissions, order flow revenue, and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenue is affected by volume and mix of trades executed. Order flow revenue is comprised of rebate payments received from trade execution venues to which our broker-dealer subsidiaries send equity and option orders. Order flow revenue is affected by volume and mix of client trades, as well as pricing received from trade execution venues. Principal transaction revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from trading activity in fixed income securities with clients. The difference between the price at which the Company buys and sells securities to and from our clients and other broker-dealers to accommodate clients’ fixed income trading activity is recognized as principal transaction revenue. Principal transaction revenue also includes adjustments to the fair value of these securities positions.The following table presents trading revenue and the related drivers:Year Ended December 31,Growth Rate2019-2020202020192018Trading Revenue (1)88 %$1,416 $752 $902 Clients' daily average trades (DATs) (in thousands)N/M2,602.6 748.9 765.4 Number of trading days1 %252.0 250.5 249.5 Revenue per trade (2)(46)%$2.16 $4.01 $4.72 Note: Effective October 7, 2019, CS&Co eliminated online trade commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options.

Percentage changes greater than 200% are presented as not meaningful.Trading revenue increased $664 million, or 88% in 2020 compared to 2019, due primarily to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade, which contributed approximately $667 million of trading revenue from October 6, 2020 forward. In addition, the Company saw a significant increase in clients’ daily average trades and higher order flow revenue in 2020, which were partially offset by the Company’s October 2019 pricing actions. Order flow revenue was $621 million, $135 million, and $139 million during 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The increase in order flow revenue in 2020 was due to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and a higher volume of trades throughout 2020 relative to 2019.Trading revenue decreased by $150 million, or 17%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily due to the elimination of online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options effective October 7, 2019. Bank Deposit Account FeesBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company began earning bank deposit account fee revenue pursuant to the IDA agreement and arrangements with other third-party banks. Bank deposit account fees are primarily affected by average BDA balances and the floating- and fixed-rate reference yields that are a key component to derive fees pursuant to the IDA - 41 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)agreement. Fees earned under the IDA agreement are affected by changes in interest rates and the composition of balances designated as fixed- and floating-rate. Bank deposit account fees totaled $355 million for the period of October 6, 2020 through December 31, 2020. During this period, the total average BDA balance was approximately $161 billion, of which approximately 80% was designated as fixed-rate obligation amounts and approximately 20% as floating-rate obligation amounts.Other RevenueOther revenue includes exchange processing fees, certain service fees, software fees, and non-recurring gains. Other revenue increased $90 million, or 37%, in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to higher exchange processing fees resulting from higher trade volumes and the acquisition of TD Ameritrade. Other revenue increased $64 million, or 36%, in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to a gain from the sale of a portfolio management and reporting software solution for advisors to Tamarac Inc. in the second quarter of 2019 and a gain from the assignment of leased office space in the first quarter of 2019.

Percentage changes greater than 200% are presented as not meaningful.Total expenses excluding interest increased $1,518 million, or 26%, in 2020 from 2019, and $303 million, or 5%, in 2019 from 2018. In 2020, total expenses excluding interest included approximately $943 million from TD Ameritrade’s results of operations from October 6, through December 31, 2020. Adjusted total expenses, which excludes acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets, increased $939 million, or 16%, in 2020 from 2019, and $279 million, or 5%, in 2019 from 2018. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results. - 42 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Total compensation and benefits increased in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to an overall increase in employee headcount due primarily to the addition of approximately 10,000 TD Ameritrade employees and the hiring of 400 former USAA employees in connection with our 2020 acquisitions. The increase in 2020 also reflected the Company’s payment of $1,000 to all non-officer employees in March 2020 to help them cover costs incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Compensation and benefits in 2020 included $235 million of acquisition and integration-related costs. The increase in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to both an overall increase in employee headcount to support our expanding client base and higher severance costs, which included $62 million associated with a 3% reduction in our workforce in the third quarter of 2019.Professional services expense increased in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to acquisition and integration-related costs in 2020 of $158 million. The increase in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to overall growth in the business, investments in projects to further drive efficiency and scale, and certain costs relating to the pending acquisitions completed in 2020.Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2020 from 2019, primarily due the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations from October 6, 2020 forward, as well as an increase in technology equipment costs associated with higher client trade volumes and overall growth in the business. The increase in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to increases in software maintenance expenses and additional licenses to support growth in the business.Communications expense increased in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations from October 6, 2020 forward and higher news and quotation services expenses due to higher trade volumes. Depreciation and amortization expenses grew in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software, higher depreciation and amortization of equipment, office facilities, and property recognized in the TDA acquisition, as well as higher depreciation of buildings and equipment related to the expansion of our U.S. campuses in 2019 and 2020. The increase in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to higher amortization of internally developed software associated with investments in software and technology enhancements.Amortization of acquired intangible assets increased in 2020 as a result of the acquisitions completed during the year. Regulatory fees and assessments increased in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations from October 6, 2020 forward, and higher FDIC insurance assessments and other regulatory assessments due to growth in assets and overall growth of the business in 2020. Regulatory fees and assessments decreased in 2019 from 2018, primarily due to a decrease in FDIC insurance assessments resulting from the elimination of the FDIC surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018.Other expenses increased in 2020 from 2019, primarily resulting from the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations from October 6, 2020 forward, and increases in processing fees and related expenses due to higher client trade volumes and market volatility. These increases were partially offset by lower travel and entertainment expense in 2020. Other expenses in 2020 included acquisition and integration-related costs of $30 million. Other expenses decreased in 2019 from 2018, primarily due to lower travel and entertainment expense and bad debt expense.Capital expenditures were $741 million, $753 million, and $576 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Capital expenditures decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower building expansion in 2020, largely offset by higher capitalized software costs. Capital expenditures increased in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to the expansion of our campuses in the U.S. Investments in buildings were $173 million, $397 million, and $253 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Capitalized software costs totaled $453 million, $188 million, and $194 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Our capital expenditures for 2020 equaled 6% of total net revenues, within our estimated range for the year. We will continue to invest in integration-related and other technology projects in 2021, and we anticipate capital expenditures in 2021 to be approximately 6-7% of total net revenues. Our longer term expectation for capital expenditures remains in the range of 3-5% of total net revenues.During 2020, the Company experienced high levels of client engagement and record trading volumes while nearly all employees were in a remote work environment. Client activity rose sharply in the fourth quarter, and the client service and operational challenges created by this environment became more pronounced. Clients experienced longer call wait times - 43 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)along with a limited number of issues in utilizing our website and mobile applications. In 2021, the Company anticipates increased spending to improve service levels and support our expanding client base, including additional technology spending as well as hiring more client service professionals. Overall in 2021, we expect total expenses excluding interest to reflect the impacts of: continued acquisition and integration-related costs primarily related to our integration of TD Ameritrade; increased spending to improve service levels and support growth; and our progress in achieving incremental cost synergies. The magnitude and timing of these impacts are inherently uncertain and depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the level of client engagement and trading volumes, the pace and levels of employee hiring, onboarding, and attrition, and changes in our needs to exit or maintain office and branch locations.Taxes on IncomeSchwab’s effective income tax rate on income before taxes was 23.3% in 2020, 23.6% in 2019, and 23.1% in 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to federal and state tax benefits recognized during 2020, including settlement of the IRS examination of tax years 2011-2014, the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain federal and state uncertain tax positions, and tax benefits realized from the filing of state tax returns, as well as an increase in Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) benefits. Offsetting the decrease in the effective tax rate from these items was an increase in nondeductible acquisition costs and FDIC insurance premium disallowance, as well as a decrease in equity compensation tax deduction benefits. The change in rates in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in equity compensation tax deduction benefits which reduced our tax expense by approximately $23 million and $46 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Segment InformationSchwab provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments – Investor Services and Advisor Services. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services to individual investors, and retirement plan services, as well as other corporate brokerage services, to businesses and their employees. The Advisor Services segment provides custodial, trading, banking, and support services, as well as retirement business services, to independent RIAs, independent retirement advisors, and recordkeepers. Revenues and expenses are attributed to the two segments based on which segment services the client. Management evaluates the performance of the segments on a pre-tax basis. Segment assets and liabilities are not used for evaluating segment performance or in deciding how to allocate resources to segments. Net revenues in both segments are generated from the underlying client assets and trading activity; differences in the composition of net revenues between the segments are based on the composition of client assets, client trading frequency, and pricing unique to each. While both segments leverage the scale and efficiency of our platforms, segment expenses reflect the dynamics of serving millions of clients in Investor Services versus the thousands of RIAs on the Advisor Services platform.The Company integrated its business and asset acquisitions during 2020 into its two existing reportable segments. Revenues and expenses from our acquisition of USAA-IMCO are allocated to Investor Services only; revenues and expenses from TD Ameritrade and our other 2020 acquisitions are attributed to both Investor Services and Advisor Services based on which segment services the client. See Item 8 – Note 3 for more information regarding acquisitions.- 44 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Financial information for our segments is presented in the following table:Investor ServicesAdvisor ServicesTotalGrowth Rate2019-2020202020192018Growth Rate2019-2020202020192018Growth Rate2019-2020202020192018Year Ended December 31,Net Revenues Net interest revenue(6)%$4,391 $4,685$4,341 (6)%$1,722 $1,831 $1,482 (6)%$6,113 $6,516 $5,823 Asset management and administration fees11%2,544 2,2892,260 1%931 922 969 8%3,475 3,211 3,229 Trading revenue (1)130%1,156 503604 4%260 249 298 88%1,416 752 902 Bank deposit account feesN/M255 —— N/M100 — — N/M355 — — Other (1)79%262 146116 (27)%70 96 62 37%332 242 178 Total net revenues13%8,608 7,6237,321 —3,083 3,098 2,811 9%11,691 10,721 10,132 Expenses Excluding Interest29%5,529 4,2844,145 17%1,862 1,589 1,425 26%7,391 5,873 5,570 Income before taxes on income(8)%$3,079 $3,339$3,176 (19)%$1,221 $1,509 $1,386 (11)%$4,300 $4,848 $4,562 Net new client assets (in billions) (2,3)N/M$1,106.4 $115.6$19.4 N/M$846.1 $107.2 $114.5 N/M$1,952.5 $222.8 $133.9 (1) Beginning in 2020, order flow revenue was reclassified from other revenue to trading revenue.

Percentage changes greater than 200% are presented as not meaningful.Segment Net RevenuesInvestor Services total net revenues increased by 13% in 2020 from 2019, while Advisor Services total net revenues remained relatively consistent year-over-year. Investor Services’ growth was primarily due to an increase in trading revenue, higher asset management and administration fees, and the initial recognition of bank deposit account fees in the fourth quarter of 2020, partially offset by lower net interest revenue. For Advisor Services, bank deposit account fees largely offset a decrease in net interest revenue, while trading revenue and asset management and administration fees were consistent with 2019. Trading revenue increased significantly in the Investor Services segment primarily due to the TD Ameritrade acquisition and higher trade volumes in 2020. Asset management and administration fees increased in 2020 for Investor Services primarily due to higher balances in advice solutions, including managed account assets from USAA and TD Ameritrade, as well as higher purchased money market funds and other third-party mutual funds and ETFs, partially offset by the effect of money fund fee waivers. Net interest revenue decreased for both segments primarily due to lower average investment yields, partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets. Investor Services and Advisor Services total net revenues increased by 4% and 10%, respectively, in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue, which increased as a result of higher average investment yields and higher interest earning assets. For Investor Services, asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to growing asset balances in advice solutions, partially offset by lower mutual fund and ETF service fee revenue as a result of client cash allocation choices, including reduced usage of Mutual Fund OneSource®. For Advisor Services, asset management and administration fees decreased primarily due to lower sweep money market fund revenue as a result of transfers to bank and broker-dealer sweep, as well as client asset allocation choices, including reduced usage of Mutual Fund OneSource®, partially offset by increased revenue from growing asset balances in purchased money market funds and in other third-party mutual funds and ETFs. Trading revenue decreased for both segments as a result of the elimination of online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options in the fourth quarter of 2019.Segment Expenses Excluding InterestInvestor Services and Advisor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 29% and 17%, respectively, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the inclusion of TD Ameritrade’s expenses from October 6, 2020 forward and - 45 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)acquisition and integration-related costs. Compensation and benefits increased in both segments primarily due to the acquisition of TDA and overall headcount growth to support our expanding client base, with Investor Services increasing more significantly due to greater headcount growth from the TDA acquisition and the hiring of approximately 400 former USAA employees in connection with the USAA-IMCO acquisition. Both segments also saw increases in professional services, depreciation and amortization, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and other expenses, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA’s expenses from October 6, 2020 forward as well as acquisition and integration-related costs, with Investor Services’ expenses increasing more significantly due to overall size of the segment’s client base and greater client base growth from TDA.Investor Services and Advisor Services expenses excluding interest increased 3% and 12%, respectively, in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits and occupancy and equipment expense. Additionally, Advisor Services had higher professional services expense due to overall growth in the business and investments in projects to further drive efficiency and scale, and Investor Services had higher amortization of internally developed software due to technology enhancements. For both segments these increases were partially offset by a decrease in FDIC insurance assessments due to the elimination of the FDIC surcharge in the fourth quarter of 2018 and lower travel and entertainment expenses.RISK MANAGEMENTSchwab’s business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks. The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that Schwab will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks.Our risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting, and risk mitigation controls; we use periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The activities and governance that comprise the risk management process are described below.As part of our integration of TD Ameritrade, the Company is aligning TD Ameritrade’s historical risk exposures with Schwab’s risk appetite. Our integration work includes evaluating new or changed risks impacting the combined company, and may involve modifications to our existing risk management processes. Though integration work continues, the Company’s operations, inclusive of TD Ameritrade, remain consistent with our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework.CultureThe Board of Directors has approved an ERM framework that incorporates our purpose, vision, and values, which form the bedrock of our corporate culture and set the tone for the organization.We designed the ERM Framework to enable a comprehensive approach to managing risks encountered by Schwab in its business activities. The framework incorporates key concepts commensurate with the size, risk profile, complexity, and continuing growth of the Company. Risk appetite, which is defined as the amount of risk the Company is willing to accept in pursuit of its corporate strategy, is developed by executive management and approved by the Board of Directors.Risk GovernanceSenior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling risks. The Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior executives from each major business and control function, is responsible for the oversight of risk management. This includes identifying emerging risks, assessing risk management practices and the control environment, reinforcing business accountability for risk management, supervisory controls and regulatory compliance, supporting resource prioritization across the organization, and escalating significant issues to the Board of Directors.- 46 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)We have established risk metrics and reporting that enable measurement of the impact of strategy execution against risk appetite. The risk metrics, with risk limits and tolerance levels, are established for key risk categories by the Global Risk Committee and its functional risk sub-committees.The Chief Risk Officer regularly reports activities of the Global Risk Committee to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. The Board Risk Committee in turn assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to our risk management program, including approving risk appetite statements and related key risk appetite metrics and reviewing reports relating to risk issues from functional areas of corporate risk management, legal, compliance, and internal audit.Functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report to the Global Risk Committee. These sub-committees include the:•Operational Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of and approves operational risk management policies, risk tolerance levels, and operational risk governance processes, and includes sub-committees covering Information Security, Fraud, Third-Party Risk, Data, and Model Governance;•Compliance Risk Committee – provides oversight of compliance risk management programs and policies providing an aggregate view of compliance risk exposure and employee conduct, including subcommittees covering Fiduciary and Conflicts of Interest Risk and International Compliance Risk;•Financial Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of and approves credit, market, liquidity, and capital risk policies, limits, and exposures; and•New Products and Services Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of, and approves corporate policy and procedures relating to, the risk governance of new products and services.Senior management has also created an Incentive Compensation Risk Oversight Committee, which establishes policy and reviews and approves the Annual Risk Assessment of incentive compensation plans, and reports directly to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Company’s compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and corporate risk management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring risk management.In addition, the Disclosure Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.Operational RiskOperational risk arises due to potential inadequacies or failures related to people, internal processes, and systems, or from external events or relationships impacting the Company and/or any of its key business partners and third parties. While operational risk is inherent in all business activities, we rely on a system of internal controls and risk management practices designed to keep operational risk and operational losses within the Company’s risk appetite. We have specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and use control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. Where appropriate, we manage the impact of operational loss and litigation expense through the purchase of insurance. The insurance program is specifically designed to address our key operational risks and to maintain compliance with local laws and regulation.Schwab’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity and resilience of our critical business functions and technology systems. To the extent Schwab experiences business or system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, technological failure, cyber attacks, changes to systems, linkages with third-party systems, and power failures), our business and operations could be negatively impacted. To minimize business interruptions and ensure the capacity to continue operations during an incident regardless of duration, Schwab maintains a backup and recovery infrastructure which includes facilities for backup and communications, a geographically dispersed workforce, and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans and a well-established incident management program.- 47 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Information Security risk is the risk of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, recording or destruction of the firm’s information or systems. We have designed and implemented an information security program that knits together complementary tools, controls and technologies to protect systems, client accounts and data. We continuously monitor the systems and work collaboratively with government agencies, law enforcement and other financial institutions to address potential threats. We use advanced monitoring systems to identify suspicious activity and deter unauthorized access by internal or external actors. We limit the number of employees who have access to clients’ personal information and internal authentication measures are enforced to protect against the potential for social engineering. All employees who handle sensitive information are trained in privacy and security. Schwab’s conduct and cybersecurity teams monitor activity looking for suspicious behavior. These capabilities allow us to identify and quickly act on any attempted intrusions.Fraud risk arises from attempted or actual theft of financial assets or other property of any client or the Company. Schwab is committed to protecting the Company’s and its clients’ assets from fraud, and complying with all applicable laws and regulations to prevent, detect and report fraudulent activity. Schwab manages fraud risk through policies, procedures and controls. We also take affirmative steps to prevent and detect fraud and report, to appropriate authorities, any known or suspected acts of fraud in accordance with existing laws and requirements.Schwab also faces operational risk when we employ the services of various third parties, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. We manage the exposure to third party risk and promote a culture of resiliency through contractual provisions, control standards, ongoing monitoring of third party performance, and appropriate testing. We also maintain policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with all data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-public client information. We clearly define for employees, contractors, and third parties the expected standards of care for critical and confidential data. We also provide regular training on data security.Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. Models are owned by several business units throughout the organization, and are used for a variety of purposes. Model use includes, but is not limited to, calculating capital requirements for hypothetical stressful environments, estimating interest and credit risk for loans and other balance sheet assets, and providing guidance in the management of client portfolios. We have established a policy to describe the roles and responsibilities of all key stakeholders in model development, management, and use. All models are registered in a centralized database and classified into different risk ratings depending on their potential financial, reputational, or regulatory impact to the Company. The model risk rating determines the scope of model governance activities.Incentive Compensation risk is the potential for adverse consequences resulting from compensation plans that do not balance the execution of our strategy with risk and financial rewards, potentially encouraging imprudent risk-taking by employees. We have implemented risk management processes, including a policy, to identify, evaluate, assess, and manage risks associated with incentive compensation plans and the activities of certain employees, defined as Covered Employees, who have the authority to expose the Company to material amounts of risk.Compliance RiskSchwab faces compliance risk which is the potential exposure to legal or regulatory sanctions, fines or penalties, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, or other regulatory requirements. Among other things, compliance risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of our controls. The Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, including SROs. We manage compliance risk through policies, procedures and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, client privacy, and employment policies. Conduct risk arises from inappropriate, unethical, or unlawful behavior of the Company, its employees or third parties acting on the Company’s behalf that may result in detriment to the Company’s clients, financial markets, the Company, and/or the Company’s employees. We manage this risk through a policy, procedures, a system of internal controls, including personnel - 48 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)monitoring and surveillance. Conduct-related matters are escalated through appropriate channels by the Corporate Responsibility Officer.Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. We manage this risk by establishing policy and procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the policy and procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees.Credit RiskCredit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations. Our exposure to credit risk mainly results from investing activities in our liquidity and investment portfolios, mortgage lending, margin lending and client option and futures activities, pledged asset lending, securities lending activities, and our role as a counterparty in other financial contracts. To manage the risks of such losses, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin, PAL, option, and futures requirements for certain securities and instruments. Liquidity and Investment PortfoliosSchwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios, which include U.S. agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. state and municipal securities, commercial paper, and foreign government agency securities.At December 31, 2020, substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade. U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.Mortgage Lending PortfolioThe bank loan portfolio includes First Mortgages, HELOCs, and other loans. The credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual loan and portfolio reviews. Management regularly reviews asset quality, including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses.Our residential loan underwriting guidelines include maximum LTV ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan size is conforming or jumbo). Schwab does not originate or purchase residential loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. For more information on credit quality indicators relating to Schwab’s bank loans, see Item 8 – Note 7. Securities and Instrument-Based Lending PortfoliosCollateral arrangements relating to margin loans, PALs, option and futures positions, securities lending agreements, and securities purchased under agreements to resell (resale agreements) include provisions that require additional collateral in the event of market fluctuations. Additionally, for margin loans, PALs, options and futures positions, and securities lending agreements, collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral sufficiently exceeds the credit exposure in order to maintain a fully secured position.- 49 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Other Counterparty ExposuresSchwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab’s clients or a counterparty fail to meet their obligations to the Company.Market RiskMarket risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by Schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, or market conditions. Schwab is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on our interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of funding sources that finance these assets. To manage interest rate risk, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting limits on net interest revenue risk and economic value of equity risk. To remain within these limits, we manage the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios. Management monitors established guidelines to stay within the Company’s risk appetite.Our measurement of interest rate risk involves assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue, bank deposit account fees, or economic value of equity (EVE). Actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies, including changes in asset and liability mix. Financial instruments are also subject to the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument. We are indirectly exposed to option, futures, and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option and futures accounts, securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers, and client securities loaned out as part of the brokerage securities lending activities. Equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity, margin borrowing, and overall client engagement with Schwab. Additionally, we earn mutual fund and ETF service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets. Fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue we earn.Our market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material. Interest Rate Risk SimulationsNet Interest Revenue SimulationFor our net interest revenue sensitivity analysis, we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulations include all balance sheet interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities. Key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, repricing of financial instruments, and reinvestment of matured or paid-down securities and loans. Net interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may reprice at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short and long-term interest rates. Interest-earning assets include investment securities, margin loans, and bank loans. These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment. Because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans, and control the composition of our investment securities, we have some ability to manage our net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions.Net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment. - 50 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)The following table shows the simulated change to net interest revenue over the next 12 months beginning December 31, 2020 and 2019 of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period:December 31,20202019Increase of 100 basis points14.2%4.8%Decrease of 100 basis points(4.3)%(7.4)%The change in sensitivities of net interest revenue as of December 31, 2020 reflects a significantly lower interest rate curve relative to December 31, 2019 due to the global economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher short-term interest rates would positively impact net interest revenue as yields on interest-earning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources. A decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the Company’s investment and loan portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources, compressing net interest margin. In addition to measuring the effect of a gradual 100 basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates, we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel- and non-parallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue.Economic Value of Equity SimulationManagement also uses EVE simulations to measure interest rate risk. EVE sensitivity measures the long-term impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates. This analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment. Key assumptions in our EVE calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, term structure models of interest rates, non-maturity deposit behavior, and pricing assumptions. Our net interest revenue and EVE simulations reflect the assumption of non-negative investment yields.Bank Deposit Account Fees SimulationsConsistent with the presentation on our statement of income, the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to interest rate changes is assessed separately from the interest rate sensitivity analysis described above. As of December 31, 2020, the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to changes in interest rates is limited, as a significant portion of BDA deposit balances are allocated to fixed-rate obligation amounts.Expected Phase-out of LIBORThe Company has established a firm-wide team to address the phasing-out of LIBOR by June 30, 2023. As part of our efforts, we have assessed our LIBOR exposures, the largest of which are certain investment securities and loans. In purchasing new investment securities, we ensure that appropriate fall-back language is in the security’s prospectus in the event that LIBOR is unavailable or deemed unreliable, and we have sold certain securities lacking appropriate fall-back language. We are updating loan agreements to ensure new LIBOR-based loans adequately provide for an alternative to LIBOR. Furthermore, we plan to phase-out the use of LIBOR as a reference rate in our new lending products before the end of December 2021, per guidance from the Federal Reserve Board. Consistent with our “Through Clients’ Eyes” strategy, our focus throughout the LIBOR transition process is to ensure clients are treated fairly and consistently as this major change is occurring in the financial markets. Liquidity RiskLiquidity risk is the potential that Schwab will be unable to sell assets or meet cash flow obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses.Due to its role as a source of financial strength, CSC’s liquidity needs are primarily driven by the liquidity and capital needs of: CS&Co, TD Ameritrade, Inc., and TDAC, our principal broker-dealer subsidiaries; the capital needs of the banking subsidiaries; principal and interest due on corporate debt; dividend payments on CSC’s preferred stock; and returns of - 51 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)capital to common stockholders. The liquidity needs of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are primarily driven by client activity including trading and margin borrowing activities and capital expenditures. The capital needs of the banking subsidiaries are primarily driven by the amount of client deposits. In addition, the liquidity needs of our banking subsidiaries can also be met by excess reserves held at the Federal Reserve, sales of investment securities, or FHLB borrowings. We have established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies, while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions. We seek to maintain client confidence in the balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the Company to meet its obligations. To this end, we have established limits and contingency funding scenarios to support liquidity levels during both business as usual and stressed conditions.We employ a variety of methodologies to monitor and manage liquidity. We conduct regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific liquidity stress events. Liquidity is also tested at certain subsidiaries and results are reported to the Financial Risk Oversight Committee. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the organization and are reviewed with management as appropriate.Primary Funding SourcesSchwab’s primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity which includes bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts. These funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients. Other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, repayments on loans, securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts, bank deposit account fees earned on client deposits placed in third-party depository programs, repurchase agreements, and cash provided by external financing.To meet daily funding needs, we maintain liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments. For unanticipated liquidity needs, we also maintain a buffer of highly liquid investments, including U.S. Treasury securities.Additional Funding SourcesIn addition to internal sources of liquidity, Schwab has access to external funding. The need for short-term borrowings from external debt facilities arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest-earning investments, movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements and general corporate purposes. We maintain policies and procedures necessary to access funding and test discount window borrowing procedures on a periodic basis.- 52 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)The following table describes external debt facilities available at December 31, 2020:DescriptionBorrowerOutstandingAvailableFederal Home Loan Bank secured credit facilities (1)Banking subsidiaries$— $55,102 Federal Reserve discount window (2)Banking subsidiaries— 7,872 Uncommitted, unsecured lines of credit with various external banksCSC, CS&Co— 1,522 Unsecured commercial paper (3)CSC— 750 Committed, unsecured credit facility with various external banks (4)CSC— 700 TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation revolving credit facility (5)TDA Holding— 300 TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc. committed, unsecured revolving credit facilities with various external banksTDAC— 1,450 Secured uncommitted lines of credit with various external banks (6)TDAC— — (1) Amounts available are dependent on the amount of First Mortgages, HELOCs, and the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral. (2) Amounts available are dependent on the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral. (3) CSC has authorization from its Board of Directors to issue Commercial Paper Notes not to exceed $1.5 billion. In February 2021, the Company increased the amount available to $1.5 billion.(4) Other than an overnight borrowing to test availability, this facility was unused during 2020.(5) Effective October 6, 2020, Schwab entered into a guaranty supplement to guarantee the obligations of TD Ameritrade under this credit agreement. The provision of the guaranty supplement was a condition for certain financial covenant and reporting obligations being modified in the credit agreement. The Company terminated this revolving credit facility effective January 28, 2021.(6) Secured borrowing is made available based on TDAC’s ability to provide acceptable collateral to the lender as determined by the credit agreement.Our banking subsidiaries maintain secured credit facilities with the FHLB. Amounts available under these facilities are dependent on the value of our First Mortgages, HELOCs, and the fair value of certain of our investment securities that are pledged as collateral. These credit facilities are also available as backup financing in the event the outflow of client cash from the banking subsidiaries’ respective balance sheets is greater than maturities and paydowns on investment securities and bank loans. Our banking subsidiaries also have access to short-term secured funding through the Federal Reserve discount window. Amounts available under the Federal Reserve discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral. CSC has a commercial paper program of which proceeds are used for general corporate purposes. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes may vary, but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue. CSC’s ratings for these short-term borrowings were P1 by Moody’s, A1 by Standard & Poor’s, and F1 by Fitch at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and CSC had no Commercial Paper Notes outstanding at December 31, 2020 or 2019.The financial covenants for the $700 million committed credit facility require CS&Co to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, all bank subsidiaries to be well capitalized, and CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity, adjusted to exclude AOCI. At December 31, 2020, the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was $16.5 billion (CSC’s stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, at December 31, 2020 was $50.7 billion). Management believes these restrictions will not have a material effect on CSC’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements.The financial covenants for the $300 million TDA Holding revolving credit facility requires CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity, adjusted to exclude AOCI. At December 31, 2020, the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was $30.9 billion (CSC’s stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI, at December 31, 2020 was $50.7 billion). Effective January 28, 2021, the Company terminated the TDA Holding revolving credit facility.To partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation, CS&Co has unsecured standby letter of credit agreements (LOCs) with several banks in favor of the Options Clearing Corporation, which totaled $15 million at December 31, 2020. There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs during 2020 or 2019. In connection with its securities lending activities, the Company is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. These collateral requirements are satisfied by providing cash as collateral.CSC has a universal automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, which enables it to issue debt, equity, and other securities.- 53 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Liquidity Coverage RatioPursuant to the 2019 interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules, beginning in the first quarter of 2020, Schwab became subject to a reduced LCR rule requiring the Company to hold HQLA in an amount equal to at least 85% of the Company’s projected net cash outflows over a prospective 30-calendar-day period of acute liquidity stress, calculated on each business day. See Item 1 – Regulation for additional information. The Company was in compliance with the reduced LCR rule at December 31, 2020.

These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, Schwab enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements in the ordinary course of business. For information on each of these arrangements, see Item 8 – Notes 7, 11, 13, 15, and 17. Concurrent with the closing of the acquisition of TD Ameritrade effective October 6, 2020, the IDA agreement with the TD Depository Institutions became effective. Pursuant to the IDA agreement, certain brokerage client deposits are required to be swept off-balance sheet to the TD Depository Institutions. TD Ameritrade also maintains agreements pursuant to which client brokerage cash deposits are swept to other third-party depository institutions. See Item 8 – Notes 3 and 15 for additional information on the IDA agreement.Contractual ObligationsSchwab’s principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 are shown in the following table. Excluded from this table are liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets that are generally short-term in nature or without contractual payment terms (e.g., bank deposits, payables to brokerage clients, and deferred compensation). The below table excludes exit and other related liabilities from the integration of TD Ameritrade (see Item 8 – Note 16), as well as obligations related to the IDA agreement (see Item 8 – Note 15).Less than1 Year1-3Years3-5YearsMore than5 YearsTotalCredit-related financial instruments (1)$3,250 $3,856 $1,884 $1,449 $10,439 Long-term debt (2)2,165 2,466 3,638 7,217 15,486 Purchase obligations (3)443 303 110 28 884 Leases (4)184 367 254 351 1,156 Total$6,042 $6,992 $5,886 $9,045 $27,965 (1) Represents CSB’s commitments to extend credit to banking clients, purchase mortgage loans, and fund CRA investments.(2) Includes estimated future interest payments through 2031 for Senior Notes.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT Schwab seeks to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support execution of our business strategy, including anticipated balance sheet growth inclusive of migration of IDA balances (see further discussion below), providing financial support to our subsidiaries, and sustained access to the capital markets, while at the same time meeting our regulatory capital requirements and serving as a source of financial strength to our banking subsidiaries. Schwab’s primary sources of capital are funds generated by the operations of subsidiaries and securities issuances by CSC in the capital markets. To ensure that Schwab has sufficient capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values, we have adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios. - 55 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Internal guidelines are set, for both CSC and its regulated subsidiaries, to ensure capital levels are in line with our strategy and regulatory requirements. Capital forecasts are reviewed monthly at Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee and Financial Risk Oversight Committee meetings. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify potential problems that could impact capital. In addition, we monitor the subsidiaries’ capital levels and requirements. Subject to regulatory capital requirements and any required approvals, any excess capital held by subsidiaries is transferred to CSC in the form of dividends and returns of capital. When subsidiaries have need of additional capital, funds are provided by CSC as equity investments and also as subordinated loans (in a form approved as regulatory capital by regulators) for CS&Co. The details and method used for each cash infusion are based on an analysis of the particular entity’s needs and financing alternatives. The amounts and structure of infusions must take into consideration maintenance of regulatory capital requirements, debt/equity ratios, and equity double leverage ratios.Schwab conducts regular capital stress testing to assess the potential financial impacts of various adverse macroeconomic and company-specific events to which the Company could be subjected. The objective of the capital stress testing is (1) to explore various potential outcomes – including rare and extreme events and (2) to assess impacts of potential stressful outcomes on both capital and liquidity. Additionally, we have a comprehensive Capital Contingency Plan to provide action plans for certain low probability/high impact capital events that the Company might face. The Capital Contingency Plan is issued under the authority of the Financial Risk Oversight Committee and provides guidelines for sustained capital events. It does not specifically address every contingency, but is designed to provide a framework for responding to any capital stress. The results of the stress testing indicate there are two scenarios which could stress the Company’s capital: (1) inflows of balance sheet cash during a period of very low interest rates and (2) outflows of balance sheet cash when other sources of financing are not available and the Company is required to sell assets to fund the flows at a loss. The Capital Contingency Plan is reviewed annually and updated as appropriate.For additional information, see Business – Regulation in Part I, Item 1.Regulatory Capital RequirementsCSC is subject to capital requirements set by the Federal Reserve and is required to serve as a source of strength for our banking subsidiaries and to provide financial assistance if our banking subsidiaries experience financial distress. Schwab is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for CSC of at least 4%, and we have a long-term operating objective of 6.75%-7.00%. Due to the relatively low risk of our balance sheet assets and risk-based capital ratios at CSC and CSB that are well in excess of regulatory requirements, the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint on CSC’s asset growth.Our banking subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements set by their regulators that are substantially similar to those imposed on CSC by the Federal Reserve. Our banking subsidiaries’ failure to remain well capitalized could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that could have a direct material effect on the banks. Schwab’s principal banking subsidiary, CSB, is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of at least 5% to be well capitalized, but seeks to maintain a ratio of at least 6.25%. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2020, CSB is considered well capitalized.As a result of the significant inflow of client cash in 2020, our Tier 1 Leverage Ratios for CSC and CSB declined from 7.3% and 7.1%, respectively, at year-end 2019 to 6.3% and 5.5%, respectively, at December 31, 2020. Though below our long-term operating objectives, these ratios are well above the regulatory minimum for both CSC and CSB. The pace of our return to the long-term operating objectives over time depends on a number of factors including the overall size of the Company’s balance sheet, earnings, and capital issuances and deployment. - 56 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)The following table details the capital ratios for CSC consolidated and CSB:December 31,2020 (1)2019 (1)CSCCSBCSCCSBTotal stockholders’ equity$56,060 $22,223 $21,745 $14,832 Less:Preferred Stock7,733 — 2,793 — Common Equity Tier 1 Capital before regulatory adjustments$48,327 $22,223 $18,952 $14,832 Less:Goodwill, net of associated deferred tax liabilities$11,897 $13 $1,184 $13 Other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities8,103 — 104 — Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances and deferred tax liabilities17 12 4 — AOCI adjustment (1)5,394 4,672 — — Common Equity Tier 1 Capital $22,916 $17,526 $17,660 $14,819 Tier 1 Capital$30,649 $17,526 $20,453 $14,819 Total Capital30,688 17,558 20,472 14,837 Risk-Weighted Assets123,881 91,062 90,512 71,521 Total Leverage Exposure491,469 325,437 286,813 216,582 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital/Risk-Weighted Assets18.5 %19.2 %19.5 %20.7 %Tier 1 Capital/Risk-Weighted Assets24.7 %19.2 %22.6 %20.7 %Total Capital/Risk-Weighted Assets24.8 %19.3 %22.6 %20.7 %Tier 1 Leverage Ratio6.3 %5.5 %7.3 %7.1 %Supplementary Leverage Ratio6.2 %5.4 %7.1 %6.8 %(1) In the interagency regulatory capital and liquidity rules adopted in October 2019, Category III banking organizations such as CSC were given the ability to opt-out of the inclusion of AOCI in regulatory capital, and CSC made this opt-out election as of January 1, 2020. Therefore, AOCI is excluded from the amounts and ratios presented as of December 31, 2020. In 2019, CSC and CSB were required to include all components of AOCI in regulatory capital; the amounts and ratios for December 31, 2019 are presented on this basis. See Business – Regulation in Part I, Item 1 for additional information.CSB is also subject to regulatory requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions. In addition, CSB is required to provide notice to, and may be required to obtain approval from, the Federal Reserve and the Texas Department of Savings and Mortgage Lending (TDSML) to declare dividends to CSC. As broker-dealers, CS&Co, TDAC, and TD Ameritrade, Inc., are subject to regulatory requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule, which is intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit the broker-dealer subsidiaries from paying cash dividends, making unsecured advances and loans to CSC and employees, and repaying subordinated borrowings from CSC if such payment would result in a net capital amount below prescribed thresholds. At December 31, 2020, CS&Co, TDAC, and TD Ameritrade, Inc. were in compliance with their respective net capital requirements.In addition to the capital requirements above, Schwab’s subsidiaries are subject to other regulatory requirements intended to ensure financial soundness and liquidity. See Item 8 – Note 23 for additional information on the components of stockholders’ equity and information on the capital requirements of significant subsidiaries.IDA AgreementPursuant to the IDA agreement, Schwab will be required to move all uninsured IDA balances out of the IDA sweep program on June 30, 2021. The IDA agreement also provides that, starting July 1, 2021, Schwab will have the option to migrate up to $10 billion of IDA balances every 12 months to Schwab’s balance sheet, subject to certain limitations and adjustments. The Company’s overall capital management strategy includes supporting migration of the uninsured IDA balances on June 30, 2021 as well as optional IDA balances in future periods as available pursuant to the terms of the IDA agreement. The Company’s ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent upon multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain these incremental deposits and the availability of IDA balances designated as floating-rate obligations. See Item 8 – Note 15 for further information on the IDA agreement.- 57 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)DividendsSince the initial dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 127 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend rate 25 times, resulting in a 21% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, CSC currently targets its common and nonvoting common stock cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income.The Board of Directors of the Company declared quarterly cash dividend increases per common share during 2019 and 2020 as shown below:Date of DeclarationQuarterly Cash Increase Per Common Share% IncreaseNew Quarterly Dividend Per Common ShareJanuary 30, 2019$0.04 31 %$0.17 January 30, 2020$0.01 6 %$0.18 The following table details the CSC cash dividends paid and per share amounts:Year Ended December 31,20202019Cash PaidPer ShareAmountCash PaidPer ShareAmountCommon and Nonvoting Common Stock$1,039 $0.72 $898 $0.68 Series A Preferred Stock (1)28 70.00 28 70.00 Series C Preferred Stock (2)36 60.00 36 60.00 Series D Preferred Stock (2)45 59.52 45 59.52 Series E Preferred Stock (3)28 4,625.00 28 4,625.00 Series F Preferred Stock (4)25 5,000.00 25 5,000.00 Series G Preferred Stock (5)79 3,150.35 N/AN/ASeries H Preferred Stock (6)N/AN/AN/AN/A(1) Dividends paid semi-annually until February 1, 2022 and quarterly thereafter.(2) Dividends paid quarterly.(3) Dividends paid semi-annually until March 1, 2022 and quarterly thereafter.(4) Dividends paid semi-annually beginning on June 1, 2018 until December 1, 2027, and quarterly thereafter.

N/A Not applicable.Share RepurchasesOn January 30, 2019, CSC publicly announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $4.0 billion of common stock. The authorization does not have an expiration date. There were no repurchases of CSC’s common stock under this authorization during the year ended December 31, 2020. During 2019, CSC repurchased 55 million shares of its common stock for $2.2 billion. As of December 31, 2020, $1.8 billion remained on our existing authorization.FOREIGN EXPOSUREAt December 31, 2020, Schwab had exposure to non-sovereign financial and non-financial institutions in foreign countries, as well as agencies of foreign governments. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of these holdings totaled $10.1 billion, with the top three exposures being to issuers and counterparties domiciled in France at $6.7 billion, Germany at $1.2 billion, and Canada at $880 million. At December 31, 2019, the fair value of these holdings totaled $6.4 billion, with the top three exposures being to issuers and counterparties domiciled in France at $3.1 billion, the Netherlands at $845 million, and Sweden at $684 million. In addition, Schwab had outstanding margin loans to foreign residents of $2.2 billion and $437 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Outstanding margin loans to foreign residents at December 31, 2020 includes $1.2 billion attributable to the inclusion of TDA balances beginning on October 6, 2020.- 58 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSSchwab uses the market approach to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, and to determine fair value disclosures. See Item 8 – Notes 2 and 18 for more information on our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value.When available, Schwab uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. Quoted prices for investments in exchange-traded securities represent end-of-day close prices published by exchanges. Quoted prices for money market funds and other mutual funds represent reported net asset values. When utilizing market data and bid-ask spread, we use the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices in active markets do not exist, prices are obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets. We generally obtain prices from three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value. Our primary third-party pricing service provides prices for our fixed income investments such as commercial paper; certificates of deposits; U.S. government and agency securities; state and municipal securities; corporate debt securities; asset-backed securities; foreign government agency securities; and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Such prices are based on observable trades, broker/dealer quotes, and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar “to-be-issued” securities. We compare the prices obtained from the primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. Schwab does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material differences in the amounts recorded. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not adjust prices received from the primary independent third-party pricing service.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe consolidated financial statements of Schwab have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Item 8 – Note 2 contains more information on our significant accounting policies made in applying these accounting principles.While the majority of the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on Schwab’s financial position and financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy.Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Additionally, management has reviewed with the Audit Committee the Company’s significant estimates discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Income TaxesSchwab estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, including federal, state and local domestic jurisdictions, and immaterial amounts owed to several foreign jurisdictions. The estimated income tax expense is reported in the consolidated statements of income in taxes on income. Accrued taxes are reported in other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to future periods. Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. In estimating accrued taxes, we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position. Because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations, interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances.- 59 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be significant to the operating results of the Company. See Item 8 – Note 22 for more information on the Company’s income taxes.Legal and Regulatory ReservesReserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved. See Item 8 – Note 15 for more information on the Company’s contingencies related to legal and regulatory reserves.Business CombinationsWe have accounted for our acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date as we allocate the purchase price to the estimated fair values of acquired tangible and intangible assets and the liabilities assumed. We also use our best estimates to determine the useful lives of the tangible and definite-lived intangible assets, which impact the periods over which depreciation and amortization of those assets are recognized. These best estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain as they pertain to forward looking views of our businesses, client behavior, and market conditions. In our acquisitions, we have also recognized goodwill at the amount by which the purchase price paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. See Item 8 – Note 3 for more information on our valuation methods and the results of applying the acquisition method of accounting, including the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and, where relevant, the estimated remaining useful lives.Our ongoing accounting for goodwill and the tangible and intangible assets acquired requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions as we exercise judgement to evaluate these assets for impairment. Our processes and accounting policies for evaluating impairments are further described in Item 8 – Note 2. One of our reporting units has an immaterial amount of goodwill. The results of the 2020 annual goodwill impairment testing for our other two reporting units indicated that the estimated fair values substantially exceeded their carrying amounts.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESIn addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with GAAP, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain references to the non-GAAP financial measures described below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information about the financial performance of the Company, and facilitate meaningful comparison of Schwab’s results in the current period to both historic and future results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. - 60 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Schwab’s use of non-GAAP measures is reflective of certain adjustments made to GAAP financial measures as described below. Non-GAAP Adjustment or MeasureDefinitionUsefulness to Investors and Uses by Management Acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assetsSchwab adjusts certain GAAP financial measures to exclude the impact of acquisition and integration-related costs incurred as a result of the Company’s acquisitions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and, where applicable, the income tax effect of these expenses. Adjustments made to exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets are reflective of all acquired intangible assets, which were recorded as part of purchase accounting. These acquired intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation. Amortization of acquired intangible assets will continue in future periods over their remaining useful lives.We exclude acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets for the purpose of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe doing so provides additional transparency of Schwab’s ongoing operations, and is useful in both evaluating the operating performance of the business and facilitating comparison of results with prior and future periods. Acquisition and integration-related costs fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and integration activities, thereby limiting comparability of results among periods, and are not representative of the costs of running the Company’s ongoing business. Amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded because management does not believe it is indicative of the Company’s underlying operating performance.Return on tangible common equityReturn on tangible common equity represents annualized adjusted net income available to common stockholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity. Tangible common equity represents common equity less goodwill, acquired intangible assets – net, and related deferred tax liabilities.Acquisitions typically result in the recognition of significant amounts of goodwill and acquired intangible assets. We believe return on tangible common equity may be useful to investors as a supplemental measure to facilitate assessing capital efficiency and returns relative to the composition of Schwab’s balance sheet. Beginning in 2021, the Company also uses adjusted diluted EPS and return on tangible common equity as components of performance criteria for employee bonus and certain executive management incentive compensation arrangements. The Compensation Committee of CSC’s Board of Directors maintains discretion in evaluating performance against these criteria.The following tables present reconciliations of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures:Year Ended December 31,202020192018Total expenses excluding interest (GAAP)$7,391 $5,873 $5,570 Acquisition and integration-related costs (1)(442)(26)— Amortization of acquired intangible assets(190)(27)(29)Adjusted total expenses (non-GAAP)$6,759 $5,820 $5,541 (1) Acquisition and integration-related costs for 2020 primarily consist of $235 million of compensation and benefits, $158 million of professional services, and $30 million of other expense.

316709,SCHW,SCHWAB CHARLES CORP,2022,"Item 7.Economic and Market RisksThe challenging economic environment triggered by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted and will continue to impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.The onset of the COVID‑19 pandemic adversely impacted the economic environment and credit markets, leading to lower interest rates across the curve, heightened volatility in the financial markets, and market-driven credit spread movements in certain sectors within our portfolio of investment securities. Although certain economic conditions improved in 2021, the pandemic continues to evolve and certain impacts of the pandemic, including short-term interest rates, may continue to have a negative impact on our net interest revenue, bank deposit account fee revenue, and asset management and administration fees. Additionally, in March 2020, we experienced a significant increase in client cash balances held at our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries which caused our Tier 1 Leverage Ratio to decline into the buffer we maintain between our long-term operating objective and our regulatory requirement. We will continue to have limits on our ability to return excess capital to stockholders, including through share repurchases, until the ratio returns to higher levels. The pandemic has also impacted our client service quality at times. Certain of our client service response and processing times increased as a result of very high levels of client engagement and our clients experienced and may continue to occasionally experience delays accessing and using our website and mobile applications. While we have focused on hiring additional client service employees, we, like many employers, continue to face challenges retaining and hiring employees. In addition, we recently experienced and may again experience staffing shortages at our call centers and branches due to the rapid spread of new variants of COVID-19. Many of our employees and those of our outsourced service providers are working remotely and this has at times contributed to the increase in response and processing times, particularly when we have experienced the temporary loss of services from some of our outsourced service providers. We consider service quality to be an important part of the client experience and our failure to meet client expectations could result in decreased client satisfaction. These and other impacts of the COVID‑19 pandemic have had and will likely continue to have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section. The extent to which the COVID‑19 pandemic, or the emergence of another wide-spread health crisis, impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including the scope and duration of the outbreak, actions taken by governmental authorities to contain the financial and economic impact and the spread of the outbreak, the effect on our clients, employees, and outsourced service providers, changes in credit quality and spreads, and reactions in the financial markets.Developments in the business, economic, and geopolitical environment could negatively impact our business.Our business can be adversely affected by the general environment – economic, corporate, securities market, regulatory, and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations, trading activity, interest rates, and overall investor engagement, and are outside of our control. Deterioration in the housing and credit markets, reduction in interest rates, and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact our results of operations and capital resources.- 13 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONThe monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States, have a significant effect on our operating results. Actions taken by the Federal Reserve, including changes in its target funds rate and balance sheet management, are difficult to predict and can affect our net interest revenue and bank deposit account fees. These policies could also have implications for clients’ allocation to cash; higher or lower client cash balances have an impact on our capital requirements as well as liquidity implications if such changes in allocation are sudden.A significant change in client cash allocations could negatively impact our income.We rely heavily on client cash balances to generate revenue. Cash awaiting investment in a portion of our client brokerage accounts is swept to our banking subsidiaries and those bank deposits are then used to extend loans to clients and purchase investment securities. We also sweep a portion of such cash to unconsolidated third-party financial institutions pursuant to the IDA agreement and agreements with other third-party financial institutions, through which we earn bank deposit account fees. A significant reduction in our clients’ allocation to cash, a change in the allocation of that cash, or a transfer of cash away from the Company, could reduce our income. Significant interest rate changes could affect our profitability.The direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings. A decline in interest rates may have a negative impact on our net interest revenue and our bank deposit account fee revenue. A low interest rate environment may also have a negative impact on our asset management and administration fee revenues when we have to waive a portion of our management fees for certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds in order to continue providing a positive return to clients. The significant reduction in interest rates related to the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a negative impact on our revenue related to interest rates and has caused us to waive management fees for certain funds.Although we believe we are positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment, a rise in interest rates may cause our funding costs to increase if market conditions or the competitive environment induces us to raise our interest rates to avoid losing deposits, or replace deposits with higher cost funding sources without offsetting increases in yields on interest-earning assets can reduce our net interest revenue.The announced phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) could negatively impact our net interest revenue and will continue to require operational work.Certain securities in our investment portfolio, the floating rate loans we offered, and certain series of our outstanding preferred stock reference LIBOR as the benchmark rate to determine the applicable interest rate, payment amount or floating dividend rates. While we have substantially transitioned our financial models and systems away from LIBOR, in limited circumstances we still use LIBOR. When LIBOR is discontinued as announced, there will be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments. This could result in different financial performance for previously booked transactions. The calculation of interest rates under the replacement benchmarks could also impact our net interest revenue. LIBOR may also perform differently during the phase-out period than in the past which could result in lower interest payments and a reduction in the value of certain securities in our investment portfolio. In addition, further operational work will be required to transition our legacy loan portfolio to alternate reference rates that are consistent with the fallback language included in the contracts. See also Part II – Item 7. – Risk Management for additional information regarding the Company’s consideration of the phase-out of LIBOR. Compliance RisksExtensive regulation of our businesses may subject us to significant penalties or limitations on business activities.As a participant in the securities, banking, and financial services industries, we are subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws by governmental agencies, supervisory authorities and SROs. The costs and uncertainty related to complying with such regulations continue to increase. These regulations affect our business operations and impose capital, client protection, and market conduct requirements on us as well as restrictions on the activities that we are allowed to conduct. We become subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny as we grow. Regulators have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies and could prevent us from pursuing our business strategy. Regulators could also limit our ability to grow, including adding assets, launching new products, making acquisitions, and undertaking strategic investments. Our banking regulators could require CSC and/or our banking subsidiaries to hold more capital, increase liquidity, or limit their ability to pay dividends or CSC’s ability to repurchase or redeem shares. Despite our efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements, there are a - 14 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONnumber of risks, particularly in areas where applicable laws or regulations may be unclear or where regulators could revise their previous guidance. Any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by our regulators against us or our affiliates, officers or employees could result in fines, penalties, cease and desist orders, enforcement actions, suspension, disqualification or expulsion, or other disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on our business activities, any of which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.While we maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, violations could occur. In addition, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time. There may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance, including restrictions on certain activities. Such a finding may also damage our reputation and our relationships with our regulators and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities.Legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively affect our business and financial results.New legislation, rules, regulations and guidance, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal, state, foreign and SRO rules, regulations and guidance, including changes relating to mutual funds, standards of conduct with clients, conflicts of interest, regulatory treatment of deposit accounts, and order routing practices and order-related revenues may directly affect our operations and profitability or our specific business lines. Our profitability could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes to the laws governing taxation, electronic commerce, client privacy and security of client data. In addition, the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business we conduct, modifications to our business practices, more stringent capital and liquidity requirements, increased deposit insurance assessments or additional costs and could limit our ability to return capital to stockholders. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to our compliance, risk management, treasury and operations functions.Failure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect our financial condition.CSC, together with its banking, broker-dealer, and FCM/FDM subsidiaries, must meet certain capital and liquidity standards, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about the adequacy of our capital and our internal assessment of our capital needs. The Uniform Net Capital Rule limits the ability of our broker-dealer entities to transfer capital to CSC and other affiliates. New regulatory capital, liquidity, capital planning, and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including paying dividends, stock repurchases, and redemptions, and may require us to increase our capital and/or liquidity or to limit our growth. Failure by either CSC or its banking subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a negative impact on us. In addition, failure by CSC or our banking subsidiaries to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to satisfy their capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer requirements would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital, replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as Tier 1 Capital, or increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity, could require us to liquidate assets, deleverage or otherwise change our business and/or investment plans, which may adversely affect our financial results. Issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders.In January 2021, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule, effective with the 2022 CCAR cycle, making large savings and loan holding companies, including CSC, subject to the CCAR process, which requires submission of an annual capital plan. The plan must include a description of all planned capital actions, including dividends or stock repurchases, over a nine-quarter planning horizon beginning with the first quarter of the calendar year the capital plan is submitted. The rule also imposes a stress capital buffer requirement, floored at 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets, that will replace CSC’s current 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer for our risk-based capital ratios. The stress capital buffer will equal, as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets, the sum of (i) the difference between a firm’s starting common equity Tier 1 capital ratio and the low point under the severely adverse scenario of the Federal Reserve’s supervisory stress test plus (ii) the ratio of the firm’s projected four quarters of common stock dividends for the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon to risk-weighted assets as projected under CCAR. The imposition of a stress capital buffer requirement could change the way in which our minimum risk-based capital ratios are calculated and make us subject to progressively more stringent constraints on capital actions if we approach our minimum ratios. This could lead to restrictions on our ability to pay or increase dividends or otherwise return capital to stockholders.- 15 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONIf the average of CSC’s total consolidated assets for four consecutive calendar quarters reaches $700 billion, or if the average of cross-jurisdictional activity for four consecutive calendar quarters reaches $75 billion, CSC will become subject to more stringent Category II requirements, including annual stress testing, the advanced approaches framework, and the inability to opt out of including AOCI in regulatory capital calculations. At December 31, 2021, CSC had approximately $670 billion in total assets and cross-jurisdictional activity of approximately $32 billion. We are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending against claims or proceedings.The financial services industry faces significant litigation and regulatory risks. We are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages. We are also the subject of inquiries, investigations, and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies.Litigation and arbitration claims include those brought by our clients and the clients of third party advisors whose assets are custodied with us. Claims from clients of third party advisors may allege losses due to investment decisions made by the third party advisors or the advisors’ misconduct. Litigation claims also include claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights (e.g., patents). Such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources. If we were found to have infringed on a third-party patent, or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial damages, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology, or providing certain products or services.Actions brought against us may result in settlements, awards, injunctions, fines, penalties or other results adverse to us, including reputational harm. Even if we are successful in defending against these actions, the defense of such matters may result in us incurring significant expenses. A substantial judgment, settlement, fine, or penalty could be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular future period, depending on our results for that period. In market downturns and periods of heightened volatility, the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased. Operational RiskSecurity breaches of our systems, or those of our clients or third parties, may subject us to significant liability and damage our reputation. Our business involves the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential information about our clients and us. Information security risks for financial institutions are increasing, in part because of the use of the internet and mobile and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, activists, hackers and other external parties, including foreign state actors. Our systems and those of other financial institutions have been and will continue to be the target of cyber attacks, malicious code, computer viruses, ransomware, and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, for example, employee misconduct.Given the high volume of transactions that we process, the large number of clients, counterparties and third-party service providers with which we do business, including cloud service providers, and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks, a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected. The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before an investigation is completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known. During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.Security breaches, including breaches of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers or clients, could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject us to significant liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance, actions by our regulators, damage to our reputation, or a loss of confidence in our security measures - 16 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONwhich could harm our business. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures.We also face risk related to external fraud involving the misappropriation and use of clients’ user names, passwords or other personal information to gain access to our clients’ financial accounts. This could occur from the compromise of clients’ personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company where clients’ personal information is taken and then made available to fraudsters. Such risk has grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties, including foreign state-sponsored parties. Losses reimbursed to clients under our guarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Technology and operational failures or errors could subject us to losses, litigation, regulatory actions, and reputational damage.We must process, record and monitor a large number of transactions and our operations are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology systems and our ability to make timely enhancements and additions to our systems. System interruptions, errors or downtime can result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to our systems, linkages with third-party systems and power failures and can have a significant impact on our business and operations. Our systems are vulnerable to disruptions from human error, execution errors, errors in models such as those used for asset management, capital planning and management, risk management, stress testing and compliance, employee misconduct, unauthorized trading, external fraud, computer viruses, distributed denial of service attacks, cyber attacks, terrorist attacks, natural disaster, extreme weather, power outage, capacity constraints, software flaws, events impacting key business partners and vendors, and similar events. For example, we and other financial institutions have been the target of various denial of service attacks that have, in certain circumstances, made websites, mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time. Cloud technologies are critical to the operation of our systems and platforms and our reliance on cloud technologies is growing. Cloud service disruptions may lead to delays in accessing data that is important to our businesses and may hinder our clients’ access to our platforms. It could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to our technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen occurrence, which could affect our ability to process and settle client transactions. Moreover, instances of fraud or other misconduct might also negatively impact our reputation and client confidence in the Company, in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances. The ways that fraudulent activity is attempted is continuously evolving and while we monitor for new types of fraud, there may be a delay in recognizing the fraud is happening. Besides potential losses, shutting down the fraudulent activity often requires a balance with client experience. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk, oversee operational areas involving risk, and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer unexpected losses, reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors, including those of our vendors or other third parties.While we devote substantial attention and resources to the reliability, capacity and scalability of our systems, extraordinary trading volumes, such as those that occurred in 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, could cause our computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail, affecting our ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients’ orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate. For example, certain of our client service response and processing times increased in 2020 as a result of very high levels of client engagement and our clients experienced delays accessing our systems during periods when there was an unusually high volume of client activity. Disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses, decreased client satisfaction, reputational damage, and regulatory inquiries. We are also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges, clearing houses, market makers, dealers, and other intermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement. System failures and constraints and transaction errors at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices and cancelled orders, cause substantial losses for us and for our clients, and subject us to claims from our clients for damages, and cause reputational harm. Our investment management operations may subject us to fiduciary or other legal liability for client losses.Fund and trust management and administration are complex activities and include functions such as recordkeeping and accounting, security pricing, corporate actions, compliance with investment restrictions, daily net asset value computations, account reconciliations, and required distributions to fund shareholders. Failure to properly perform operational tasks, or the misrepresentation of our services and products could subject us to regulatory sanctions, penalties or litigation and result in reputational damage, liability to clients, and the termination of investment management or administration agreements and the withdrawal of assets under our management.- 17 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONIn the management and administration of funds and client accounts, we use quantitative models and other tools and resources to support investment decisions and processes, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, trading and hedging activities and product valuations. Errors in the design, function, or underlying assumptions used in these models and tools, particularly if we fail to detect the errors over an extended period, could subject us to claims of a breach of fiduciary duty and potentially large liabilities for make-whole payments, litigation, and/or regulatory fines.We rely on outsourced service providers to perform key functions.We rely on external service providers to perform certain key technology, cloud infrastructure, processing, servicing, and support functions. These service providers face technology, operating, business, and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee, or company information, could cause us to incur losses and could harm our reputation. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider as a result of systems failures, capacity constraints, financial difficulties, natural disasters, extreme weather, power outage, public health crises, political developments or for any other reason, and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services, and result in financial losses to us. As a result of certain stay at home restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily lost the services from some of our outsourced service providers which contributed to increased client service response and processing times. Switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations.We rely on financial intermediaries to execute and settle client orders. We rely on market makers, dealers, securities exchanges, clearing houses, and other financial intermediaries to execute and settle our clients’ orders. The unwillingness or inability of any of these parties to perform their usual functions coupled with the unavailability of alternative arrangements could result in our clients’ orders not getting executed or settled. This may be due to market volatility, uneconomic trading conditions, capacity constraints, financial constraints, system failures, unanticipated trading halts invoked by securities exchanges, market closures, or other reasons. Our inability to get client orders executed or settled because of the unwillingness or inability of these parties to perform their usual functions could result in client dissatisfaction and reputational harm and expose us to client claims for damages. Liquidity RiskA significant decrease in our liquidity could negatively affect our business as well as reduce client confidence in us.Maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to our business operations, including transaction settlement, custody requirements, and lending commitments, among other liquidity needs. We meet our liquidity needs primarily from working capital and cash generated by client activity as well as external financing. Fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances, as well as market conditions or changes in regulatory treatment of client deposits, may affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs. A reduction in our liquidity position could reduce client confidence in us, which could result in the transfer of client assets and accounts, or could cause us to fail to satisfy our liquidity requirements, including the LCR. In addition, if our broker-dealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines, regulators could limit the subsidiaries’ operations or their ability to upstream funds to CSC, which could reduce CSC’s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt, pay dividends on CSC’s preferred stock, or return capital to common stockholders. In addition, CSC may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries.Factors which may adversely affect our liquidity position include CS&Co and TDAC having temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances, fluctuations in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts, a dramatic increase in our lending activities (including margin, mortgage-related, and personal lending), increased capital requirements, changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations, other regulatory changes, or a loss of market or client confidence in us resulting in unanticipated withdrawals of client funds. As a member firm of securities and derivatives clearing houses, we are required to deposit cash, stock and/or government securities for margin requirements and to clearing funds. The margin requirements may fluctuate significantly from time to time based upon the nature and size of clients’ trading activity and market volatility. For example, as a result of recent market volatility the National Securities Clearing Corporation increased margin requirements for member firms and we were required to deposit additional funds. Clearing houses could also require additional funds from member firms if a clearing member defaults on its obligations to the clearing house in an amount larger than its own margin and clearing fund deposits.- 18 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONWhen available cash is not sufficient for our liquidity needs, we may seek external financing. During periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets, potential sources of external financing could be reduced, and borrowing costs could increase. Although CSC, CS&Co, and TDAC maintain uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines and CSC has a commercial paper issuance program, as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC which can be used to sell securities, financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets. In addition, a significant downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets.Credit RiskWe may suffer significant losses from our credit exposures.Our businesses are subject to the risk that a client, counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations, or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate. While we have policies and procedures designed to manage this risk, the policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Our exposure mainly results from margin lending, clients’ options and futures trading, securities lending, mortgage lending, pledged asset lending, our role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities, and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds we sponsor.When clients purchase securities on margin, borrow on lines of credit collateralized by securities, or trade options or futures, we are subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their accounts falls below the amount of clients’ indebtedness. Abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses, especially if there is a lack of liquidity. As a result of our TD Ameritrade acquisition, our margin, options and futures business has materially increased and market liquidity may represent an increased risk.We have exposure to credit risk associated with our investments. Those investments are subject to price fluctuations. Loss of value of securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such loss of value has resulted from a credit loss. The evaluation of whether a credit loss exists is a matter of judgment, which includes the assessment of multiple factors. If management determines that a security’s decline in fair value is the result of a credit loss, an allowance for credit losses on the security will be recorded and a corresponding loss will be recognized in current earnings. Even if a decline in fair value of a security is not determined to have resulted from a credit loss, if we were ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity needs, we would have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time. Our bank loans primarily consist of First Mortgages, HELOCs, and PALs. Increases in delinquency and default rates, housing and stock price declines, increases in the unemployment rate, and other economic factors, including from the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, can result in increases in allowances for credit losses and related credit loss expense, as well as write downs on such loans.Heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments can increase our risk of loss. Examples include:•Large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry;•Mortgage loans and HELOCs to banking clients which are secured by properties in the same geographic region; and•Client margins, options or futures, pledged assets, and securities lending activities collateralized by or linked to securities of a single issuer, index, or industry.We sponsor a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds. Although we have no obligation to do so, we may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit, liquidity or other support to our funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity. Such support could cause us to take significant charges, could reduce our liquidity and, in certain situations, could, with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds, result in us having to consolidate one or more funds in our financial statements. If we choose not to provide credit, liquidity or other support in such a situation, we could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected.- 19 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONRisks Related to Our TD Ameritrade AcquisitionWe may fail to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the TD Ameritrade acquisition, which could adversely affect the value of our stock.The success of our TD Ameritrade acquisition will continue to depend, in significant part, on our ability to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from integrating the businesses of Schwab and TD Ameritrade which is subject to certain risks. If we are not able to successfully combine the businesses of Schwab and TD Ameritrade within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected, the combined business may not perform as expected and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key Schwab or TD Ameritrade employees, the loss of clients, the disruption of either company’s or both companies’ ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated.Most of the integration planning and execution work is currently being done remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The inability to work in-person and on-site with information technology and management oversight has and will continue to make some of the integration work more challenging, particularly with regard to technology. We will need to continue to hire a significant number of technology personnel and contract staff and rely on a number of critical technology vendors in order to complete the integration work relating to technology platforms and systems within the target timeframe. In addition, we may experience delays in acquiring the technology and infrastructure components needed for the integration due to pandemic-related supply chain disruptions. We have to make certain assumptions for integration planning and subsequent changes to integration plans impact the timing and cost of the integration. For example, as a result of the higher levels of trading volumes that we recently experienced, we had to increase capacity from the original technology build-out plan. In addition, at times the attention of certain members of our management and other resources may be diverted from integration work to critical day-to-day business operations. We may also encounter challenges integrating TD Ameritrade technologies into Schwab platforms. Any of these factors could make timely achievement of integration milestones more challenging, particularly with regard to technology and systems. We will continue to incur significant integration costs in connection with the integration of TD Ameritrade. We will continue to incur significant non-recurring costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans with respect to combining the operations of Schwab and TD Ameritrade, including technology-related, workforce and facilities consolidation costs. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies’ businesses. We may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other employees during the integration of TD Ameritrade.Uncertainty about the effect of the TD Ameritrade integration on Schwab and TD Ameritrade employees may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the integration process, as employees of Schwab and TD Ameritrade may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined business. If employees of Schwab or TD Ameritrade depart, the integration of the companies may be more difficult and the combined business may be harmed. Furthermore, we may have to incur significant costs in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent relating to the businesses of Schwab or TD Ameritrade, and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may be adversely affected. In addition, there could be disruptions to or distractions for the workforce and management associated with integrating employees into Schwab. - 20 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONThe TD Ameritrade acquisition may not be accretive to our earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Based on the anticipated synergies between Schwab and TD Ameritrade, we expect the acquisition to be accretive to our earnings per share in the third year following completion of the merger. However, future events and conditions could reduce or delay the accretion that is currently projected or result in the acquisition being dilutive to our earnings per share, including adverse changes in market conditions, additional transaction and integration related costs and other factors such as the failure to realize some or all of the benefits anticipated in the acquisition. Any dilution of, reduction in, or delay of any accretion to, our earnings per share could cause the price of shares of our common stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate. Other Business RisksPotential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on our financial position.We evaluate potential strategic transactions, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions. Any such transaction could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The process of evaluating, negotiating, effecting, and integrating any such strategic transaction may divert management’s attention from other business concerns, and might cause the loss of key clients, employees, and business partners. Moreover, integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties, including the need to integrate operational, financial, and management information systems and management controls, integrate relationships with clients and business partners, and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas. The integration process could result in the disruption of ongoing businesses or changes to inconsistent standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, employees, outsourced service providers and vendors. In addition, an acquisition may cause us to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings or require the amortization of a large amount of acquired intangible assets. Further, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition in a timely manner or at all (including without limitation the recent acquisition of TD Ameritrade), and any future acquisition could be dilutive to our current stockholders’ percentage ownership or to earnings per common share (EPS).Our acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in the business, operations or financial condition of the entity or part of an entity being acquired or sold. To the extent we enter into an agreement to buy or sell an entity or part of an entity, there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected, or at all. If a material transaction does not close, our stock price could decline.Our industry is highly competitive and characterized by aggressive price competition.We operate in a highly competitive environment with a broad array of competitors from large integrated banks to venture-capital backed private companies. We continually monitor our pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjust interest rates on deposits and loans, fees for advisory services, expense ratios on mutual funds and ETFs, trade commission rates, and other pricing and incentives to sustain our competitive position. Increased price competition from other financial services firms to attract clients, such as reduced commissions, higher deposit rates, reduced mutual fund or ETF expense ratios, or the increased use of incentives, could impact our results of operations and financial condition.We face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees.The market for qualified personnel in our business is highly competitive. At various times, different functions and roles are in especially high demand in the market, compelling us to pay more to attract talent. Recently, the challenge and cost for us to retain and hire talent has increased. In September 2021, we implemented a 5% salary increase for almost all of our employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs.We need to continue to hire a significant number of technology personnel and contract staff to complete the TD Ameritrade integration work within the target timeframe. Demand for skilled technology professionals is high and we may experience delays in hiring the appropriate skilled resources.- 21 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONOur stock price has fluctuated historically, and may continue to fluctuate.Our stock price can be volatile. Among the factors that may affect the volatility of our stock price are the following:•Speculation in the investment community or the press about, or actual changes in, our competitive position, organizational structure, executive team, operations, financial condition, financial reporting and results, expense discipline, strategic transactions, progress on achieving the expected benefits from our TD Ameritrade acquisition, or ratings from third parties;•The announcement of new products, services, acquisitions, or dispositions by us or our competitors; •Increases or decreases in revenue or earnings, changes in earnings estimates by the investment community, and variations between estimated financial results and actual financial results; and•Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by large stockholders.Changes in the stock market generally, or as it concerns our industry, as well as geopolitical, corporate, regulatory, business, and economic factors may also affect our stock price.Future sales of CSC’s equity securities may adversely affect the market price of CSC’s common stock and result in dilution.CSC’s certificate of incorporation authorizes CSC’s Board of Directors, among other things, to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities, without stockholder approval.CSC may issue additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital or for other purposes. The issuance of any additional equity or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of CSC’s common stock and may adversely affect the market price of CSC’s common stock.Our ongoing relationships with TD Bank and its affiliates could have a negative impact on us. Although our acquisition of TD Ameritrade was structured such that completion of the merger would not result in CSC either (i) being deemed to be “controlled” by TD Bank (as that term is interpreted by the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act or HOLA) or (ii) being deemed to be in “control” of any of TD Bank’s depository institutions, changes in circumstances could trigger presumptions of control under the Federal Reserve’s regulations. This could occur if TD Bank and its affiliates own more than 9.9% of Schwab common stock, as interpreted in accordance with the applicable rules of the Federal Reserve. While the Stockholder Agreement between CSC and TD Bank prohibits TD Bank and its affiliates from exceeding the 9.9% threshold, it could happen unintentionally. This presumption of control could also be triggered if the revenue generated to either us or to any of the TD Bank depository institutions exceeds a certain percentage. The Stockholder Agreement contains provisions to address such situations.Under the IDA agreement, we are only permitted to reduce the deposit balances swept to the TD Depository Institutions by a set amount during each 12-month period, subject to certain limitations and adjustments including only moving IDA balances designated as floating-rate obligations and maintaining a minimum $50 billion IDA sweep balance through June 2031. The bank deposit account fee revenue that we earn related to the IDA agreement may be less than the net interest revenue that we could have earned if the deposit balances were swept to our banking subsidiaries rather than the TD Depository Institutions. When we are permitted to reduce the IDA balances, we can only move the balances to our banking subsidiaries if we have sufficient capital. In addition, in a low rate environment it is possible that the sweep arrangement fee computation could result in a negative amount that we would be required to pay the TD Depository Institutions, resulting in us having an expense rather than revenue.

We believe that metrics relating to net new and total client assets, as well as client cash levels and utilization of advisory services, offer perspective on our business momentum and client engagement. Data on new and total client brokerage accounts provides additional perspective on our ability to attract and retain new business. Total net revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin, EPS, return on average common stockholders’ equity, and the Consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio provide broad indicators of Schwab’s overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns.

Early in 2021 we saw strengthened investor optimism, fueled by an advancing economic recovery and signs of improvement in the COVID-19 pandemic. As the year progressed, debates increased over the pace of economic growth, the path of inflation, and the ultimate impact of multiple global market disruptions. After major equity indices rose throughout the first half of 2021, they were essentially flat during the summer months before ending the year at near-record levels. While short-term interest rates remained near zero throughout 2021, longer-term rates began to rise initially, then eased and rose again as the 10-year Treasury yield finally ended 2021 at 1.52%, up 59 basis points from year-end 2020.Investors were actively engaged with the markets throughout 2021, including extraordinary trading volume in the first quarter, and client activity throughout the remainder of the year also generally exceeded the fourth quarter of 2020 when we included TD Ameritrade in our results for the first time. Asset gathering was strong throughout 2021, as core net new assets totaled $558.2 billion, representing an 8% annual organic growth rate from year-end 2020. We ended 2021 with $8.14 trillion in client assets and 33.2 million brokerage accounts, representing increases of 22% and 12%, respectively, from December 31, 2020. Even as we worked to support heightened levels of client activity during 2021, the Company continued to drive progress across our key strategic priorities of scale and efficiency, win-win monetization, and segmentation. We made significant progress on our integration of TD Ameritrade, and continue to expect to complete client conversion within 30 to 36 months from the October 6, 2020 acquisition date. Schwab produced strong financial performance during 2021, reflecting consistent execution of our strategy, strong client engagement, and a generally supportive macroeconomic backdrop. Net income totaled $5.9 billion during 2021, increasing 77% from 2020, while diluted earnings per common share (EPS) amounted to $2.83, increasing 33% from the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS (1), which excludes acquisition and integration-related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and related income tax effects, amounted to $3.25, increasing 33% from 2020. Our financial results were significantly impacted by the inclusion of TD Ameritrade for the full year of 2021.Total net revenues increased 58% from 2020 to reach $18.5 billion in 2021, supported by growth across all of our major revenue streams. Net interest revenue totaled $8.0 billion in 2021, increasing 31% from 2020 primarily due to the inclusion of TD Ameritrade as well as significant growth in interest-earning assets, including rising investment portfolio balances and increased utilization of our range of lending products, partially offset by lower average yields. Asset management and administration fees grew 23% over the prior year to reach $4.3 billion due to the inclusion of TD Ameritrade as well as rising balances in advice solutions and both proprietary and third-party mutual funds and ETFs, partially offset by lower revenue on money market funds.Trading revenue was $4.2 billion in 2021, nearly three times the prior year total of $1.4 billion, as the full-year inclusion of TD Ameritrade and the overall strong trading environment drove a significant increase in DATs. Trading revenue was also helped in 2021 by a higher proportion of derivatives trades, which contributed to higher revenue per trade. A full year of bank deposit account fees totaled $1.3 billion in 2021. BDA balances totaled $158.6 billion at December 31, 2021, down 3% from the year-end 2020 balance of $163.5 billion, reflecting migrations to Schwab’s balance sheet during 2021.Total expenses excluding interest were $10.8 billion in 2021, increasing 46% from 2020 due to the full-year inclusion of TD Ameritrade’s results as well as higher compensation and benefits expense, which was driven by additional headcount to support our expanding client base and a higher bonus accrual, as well as merit increases and a 5% employee salary increase we implemented at the end of the third quarter. During 2021, acquisition and integration-related costs were $468 million, increasing from $442 million in 2020, and amortization of acquired intangible assets totaled $615 million, rising from $190 million in 2020. Exclusive of these items, adjusted total expenses (1) were $9.7 billion in 2021, increasing 44% from 2020.Return on average common stockholders’ equity was 11% in 2021, growing from 9% in 2020, and return on tangible common equity (1) (ROTCE) was 22% in 2021, up from 15% in 2020. The increases in both return on average common stockholders’ equity and ROTCE were primarily a result of significantly higher net income in 2021. (1) Adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted total expenses, and return on tangible common equity are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results.- 32 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)The Company continued its consistent approach to balance sheet management in 2021, supporting overall growth and liquidity. Total balance sheet assets rose to $667.3 billion at December 31, 2021, increasing 22% from year-end 2020, driven primarily by client asset flows, as well as $10.6 billion in BDA balance migrations. We also added a net $10.2 billion to outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt for liquidity management purposes, and increased preferred stock by a net $2.3 billion to help support continued business growth. The Company’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 6.2% at year-end 2021. Though significantly heightened client activity levels during the first quarter of 2021 impacted our service quality at times, we took multiple actions to better deliver the service experience our clients deserve and rely on, including enhancing online self-service capabilities, streamlining our call-routing processes, and increasing hiring. Our efforts began yielding results early in the year, with significant improvement in client service levels by the end of the first quarter, and our service levels continued to be improved throughout the remainder of 2021 as client activity moderated.2020 Compared to 2019 Throughout the extraordinary macroeconomic environment that persisted during 2020, Schwab continued to execute on key strategic initiatives, and produced solid financial results. The impact of COVID-19, along with social and political turmoil, created an unprecedented combination of personal and macroeconomic challenges for our clients, employees, and stockholders. While working through these challenges, we progressed in advancing the Company’s strategic goals to drive scale, monetization, and segmentation in ways that benefit our clients. Among the Company’s key accomplishments in 2020 were the successful completion of the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and three other strategic acquisitions, as discussed below. The COVID-19 pandemic’s rapid escalation in early 2020 was accompanied by volatile equity markets and the Federal Reserve’s further easing of monetary policy. As the year progressed, government aid packages and vaccine developments helped settle the markets, with the S&P 500® erasing its pandemic-related losses to finish up 16% for the year. Throughout 2020, client engagement with the financial markets greatly increased over the prior year, as client trading activity reached record levels. Core net new assets totaled $281.9 billion in 2020, representing our third consecutive year of over $200 billion. Total client assets reached $6.69 trillion spread across 29.6 million brokerage accounts, up 66% and 140%, respectively, from year-end 2019.Against this backdrop, Schwab’s net income totaled $3.3 billion, down $405 million, or 11% from 2019, while the Company produced diluted EPS of $2.12, representing a decrease of 21% relative to 2019. Adjusted diluted EPS (1) amounted to $2.45 in 2020, down 9% from $2.70 in 2019. Total net revenues reached $11.7 billion for the year, increasing 9% from 2019. During March 2020, the Federal Reserve acted to support the economy by cutting the Fed Funds rate from 1.75% to near zero and announcing significant asset purchase programs. Mortgage refinancing activity subsequently accelerated, and our net interest margin was impacted by both significantly lower interest rates and increased prepayments of mortgage-backed securities held in our investment portfolio. Strong growth in interest-earning assets via client inflows and allocation decisions, as well as our acquisitions of TD Ameritrade and assets of USAA-IMCO, helped limit the decrease in net interest revenue to 6%, resulting in a full-year 2020 total of $6.1 billion. Growing balances in advisory solutions and a rebound in equity markets in 2020 helped drive an 8% increase in asset management and administration fees, which totaled $3.5 billion in 2020. Record client trading activity and the addition of TD Ameritrade in the fourth quarter contributed to an 88% increase in trading revenue, which reached $1.4 billion for the year, more than offsetting a full-year impact of the commission reductions implemented in the fourth quarter of 2019. With the TD Ameritrade acquisition, our fourth quarter 2020 results included bank deposit account fee revenue for the first time, which totaled $355 million for the period from October 6, through December 31, 2020.Total expenses excluding interest increased 26% in 2020 to $7.4 billion, which included significant costs related to our acquisitions. With the completion of four acquisitions during the year, acquisition and integration-related costs totaled $442 million in 2020, representing a significant increase from the $26 million incurred in 2019. Amortization of acquired intangible assets also increased, totaling $190 million in 2020 compared with $27 million in 2019. Exclusive of these items, adjusted total expenses (1) increased 16% from 2019. Return on average common stockholders’ equity was 9% in 2020, down from 19% in 2019. ROTCE (1) was 15% in 2020, down from 21% in 2019. The 2020 decreases in both return on average common stockholders’ equity and ROTCE were due to lower net income as well as significantly higher balances of common equity due to the TDA acquisition and higher AOCI in 2020, driven by unrealized gains in our AFS investment portfolio.(1) Adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted total expenses, and return on tangible common equity are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results.- 33 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Throughout 2020, the Company maintained its disciplined approach to capital management, helping sustain significant balance sheet growth. Schwab’s consolidated total assets ended 2020 at $549 billion, representing growth of $255 billion, or 87%, from year-end 2019, reflecting both our organic growth as well as the acquisitions of TD Ameritrade and the assets of USAA-IMCO. Through offerings in April and December, the Company issued preferred stock totaling approximately $5 billion in 2020, bringing total preferred stock to approximately $7.7 billion, or approximately 25% of Tier 1 Capital at December 31, 2020. The Company’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 6.3% at December 31, 2020.Business and Asset AcquisitionsTD Ameritrade Effective October 6, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade. TD Ameritrade provides securities brokerage services, including trade execution, clearing services, and margin lending, through its broker-dealer subsidiaries; and futures and foreign exchange trade execution services through its FCM and FDM subsidiary. At the time of closing, TD Ameritrade had approximately $1.6 trillion in client assets and approximately 14.5 million brokerage accounts. TD Ameritrade’s assets and liabilities were revalued and recorded at their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition. The Company expects to continue to incur significant acquisition and integration-related costs and integration-related capital expenditures throughout the integration process. Such costs have included, and are expected to continue to include, professional fees, such as legal, advisory, and accounting fees, compensation and benefits expenses for employees and contractors involved in the integration work, and costs for technology enhancements. The Company has also incurred exit and other related costs to attain anticipated synergies, which are primarily comprised of employee compensation and benefits such as severance pay, other termination benefits, and retention costs, as well as costs related to facility closures such as accelerated amortization and depreciation or impairments of assets in those locations. The Company’s estimates of the nature, amounts, and timing of recognition of acquisition and integration-related costs remain subject to change based on a number of factors, including the expected duration and complexity of the integration process and the continued uncertainty of the current economic environment. More specifically, factors that could cause variability in our expected acquisition and integration-related costs include the level of employee attrition, workforce redeployment from eliminated positions into open roles, changes in the levels of client activity, as well as increased real estate-related exit cost variability due to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic including changes in remote working trends.As a result of the significant growth seen beginning in late 2020 and early 2021 across key client volume metrics, including the number of active brokerage accounts, DATs, and peak daily trades, the Company determined in 2021 to increase the scope of technology work related to the integration. In 2021, we commenced greater technology build-out to support the expanded volumes of our combined client base. Based on our current integration plans and expanded scope of technology work, the Company continues to expect to complete client conversion within 30 to 36 months from the October 6, 2020 acquisition date, and we expect to incur total acquisition and integration-related costs and capital expenditures of between $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion. Acquisition and integration-related costs, which are inclusive of related exit costs, totaled $468 million and $442 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and the Company expects to incur acquisition and integration-related costs of approximately $350-$400 million in 2022. Over the course of the integration, we continue to expect to realize annualized cost synergies of between $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion, and, through December 31, 2021, we have achieved approximately half of this amount on an annualized run-rate basis. The Company expects to have realized approximately 60% of our estimated annualized cost synergies by year-end 2022, with much of the remaining estimated cost synergies expected to be realized after the completion of client conversion and into 2024. Estimated timing and amounts of synergy realization are subject to change as we progress in the integration.

Along with the asset purchase agreement, the companies entered into a long-term referral agreement that makes Schwab the exclusive provider of wealth management and investment brokerage services for USAA members. The USAA-IMCO acquisition has added scale to the Company’s operations through the addition of 1.1 million brokerage and managed portfolio accounts with approximately $80 billion in client assets at the acquisition date. The transaction also provides Schwab the opportunity to further expand our - 34 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)client base by serving USAA’s members through the long-term referral agreement. See Item 8 – Note 3 for more information on the USAA-IMCO acquisition.In addition, during 2020 the Company completed its acquisition of technology and intellectual property of Motif, a financial technology company. The Motif assets help us build on our existing capabilities and help accelerate our development of thematic and direct index investing for Schwab’s retail investors and RIA clients. Also during 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of Wasmer Schroeder, which adds established strategies and new separately managed account offerings to our existing fixed income lineup.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSTotal Net RevenuesTotal net revenues of $18.5 billion and $11.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, represented growth of 58% and 9% from the prior periods. The increases in 2021 and 2020 were due primarily to our acquisition of TD Ameritrade, which contributed total net revenues of $7.6 billion in 2021 and $1.7 billion in 2020 from October 6, through December 31, 2020.

Percentage changes greater than 200% are presented as not meaningful.Net Interest RevenueSchwab’s primary interest-earning assets include cash and cash equivalents; cash and investments segregated; margin loans, which constitute the majority of receivables from brokerage clients; investment securities; and bank loans. Revenue on interest-earning assets is affected by various factors, such as the composition of assets, prevailing interest rates and spreads at the time of origination or purchase, changes in interest rates on floating rate securities and loans, and changes in prepayment levels for mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and loans. Fees earned and expenses incurred on securities lending and borrowing activities are conducted by our broker-dealer subsidiaries using assets held in client brokerage accounts.Schwab’s interest-bearing liabilities include bank deposits, payables to brokerage clients, short-term borrowings (e.g., Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances, commercial paper, secured borrowings by our broker-dealer subsidiaries, repurchase agreements), and long-term debt. Schwab deploys the funds from these sources into the assets outlined above. As Schwab builds its client base, we attract new client sweep cash, which is a primary driver of funding balance sheet growth. We do not use short-term, wholesale borrowings to support our long-term investment activity, but may use such funding for short-term liquidity purposes or to provide temporary funding. Non-interest-bearing funding sources include stockholders’ equity, certain client cash balances, and other miscellaneous liabilities. - 35 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)The Company’s investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise while attempting to moderate the decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall. In order to keep interest-rate sensitivity within established limits, management actively monitors and adjusts interest-rate sensitivity through changes in the balance sheet, primarily by adjusting the composition of our banking subsidiaries’ investment portfolios. Schwab establishes the rates paid on client-related liabilities, and management expects that it will generally adjust the rates paid on these liabilities at some fraction of any movement in short-term rates. See also Risk Management – Interest Rate Risk Simulations.As the U.S. economic recovery continued in 2021, interest rates remained historically low. Short-term rates remained near zero throughout 2021; longer-term interest rates began to rise early in the year, then remained largely unchanged before rising again in the fourth quarter. Elevated levels of prepayments on mortgage-backed securities persisted throughout the continued low interest rate environment in 2021 and resulted in accelerated reinvestment of the AFS portfolio; purchases of AFS securities totaled $171.7 billion. Schwab saw consistent strength in new client brokerage accounts and net new client assets throughout 2021, driving growth in Schwab’s interest-earning assets. At the same time, client engagement in the equity markets increased and clients were net buyers of equity securities and other investment products, resulting in outflows of client cash and partially offsetting the growth in interest-earning assets.Late in the first quarter of 2020, the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds target overnight rate from 1.75% to near zero; on the longer end of the curve, the 10-year Treasury rate declined by over 120 basis points. Lower interest rates across maturities persisted from the end of the first quarter through the end of 2020, while credit spreads also compressed. Moreover, changes in the economic environment throughout 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic drove significantly higher levels of client cash sweep balances. As these balances rapidly accumulated in the first quarter of 2020, the Company initially placed a substantial amount in excess reserves held at the Federal Reserve, and subsequently deployed a significant amount of this cash build-up throughout 2020. AFS securities purchases in 2020 totaled $202.2 billion, and these purchases were made at rates below the average yield on the existing AFS portfolio due to the low interest rate environment.The following table presents net interest revenue information corresponding to interest-earning assets and funding sources on the consolidated balance sheets:Year Ended December 31,202120202019AverageBalanceInterestRevenue/ExpenseAverage Yield/RateAverageBalanceInterest Revenue/ExpenseAverage Yield/RateAverageBalanceInterest Revenue/ExpenseAverage Yield/RateInterest-earning assetsCash and cash equivalents$40,325 $40 0.10 %$39,052 $120 0.30 %$23,512 $518 2.17 %Cash and investments segregated43,942 24 0.05 %34,100 141 0.41 %15,694 345 2.17 %Receivables from brokerage clients77,768 2,455 3.11 %28,058 848 2.97 %19,270 821 4.20 %Available for sale securities (1,2)357,122 4,641 1.30 %253,555 4,537 1.78 %58,181 1,560 2.67 %Held to maturity securities (1,2)— — — — — — 134,708 3,591 2.65 %Bank loans28,789 620 2.15 %20,932 545 2.60 %16,832 584 3.47 %Total interest-earning assets547,946 7,780 1.41 %375,697 6,191 1.64 %268,197 7,419 2.75 %Securities lending revenue720 334 147 Other interest revenue6 6 14 Total interest-earning assets$547,946 $8,506 1.54 %$375,697 $6,531 1.73 %$268,197 $7,580 2.80 %Funding sourcesBank deposits$381,549 $54 0.01 %$291,206 $93 0.03 %$212,605 $700 0.33 %Payables to brokerage clients91,667 9 0.01 %46,347 12 0.02 %24,353 79 0.33 %Short-term borrowings (3)3,040 9 0.30 %89 — 0.20 %17 — 2.36 %Long-term debt17,704 384 2.17 %8,992 289 3.22 %7,199 258 3.58 %Total interest-bearing liabilities493,960 456 0.09 %346,634 394 0.11 %244,174 1,037 0.42 %Non-interest-bearing funding sources53,986 29,063 24,023 Securities lending expense24 33 38 Other interest expense(4)(9)(11)Total funding sources$547,946 $476 0.09 %$375,697 $418 0.11 %$268,197 $1,064 0.39 %Net interest revenue$8,030 1.45 %$6,113 1.62 %$6,516 2.41 %(1) Amounts have been calculated based on amortized cost.

See Item 8 – Note 6.(3) Interest revenue or expense was less than $500 thousand in the period or periods presented.- 36 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Net interest revenue increased $1.9 billion or 31%, in 2021 from 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of TD Ameritrade as well as significant growth in overall interest-earning assets, including higher investment portfolio balances and margin lending, as well as growth in securities lending revenue and bank loans, partially offset by lower average yields. Accelerated premium amortization stemming from elevated prepayments of mortgage-related debt securities in the AFS portfolio continued in 2021 and partially offset the growth in net interest revenue. Net premium amortization of investment securities totaled $2.3 billion in 2021 and $1.6 billion in 2020. TD Ameritrade contributed total net interest revenue of $1.9 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021 and $443 million in 2020 from October 6, through December 31, 2020. Average interest-earning assets for 2021 were higher by 46%, compared to 2020. This increase was largely due to higher bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients, which resulted from strong net new client asset inflows, continued heightened client cash allocations driven by the low interest rate environment, BDA balance migrations, and the inclusion of TD Ameritrade for all of 2021. Our net interest margin declined to 1.45% in 2021, from 1.62% in 2020. This decrease was driven primarily by lower overall yields received on interest-earning assets, in part due to purchases of investment securities in 2020 and 2021 at rates below the average yield on the AFS portfolio. This more than offset the benefit of increased securities lending revenue and higher margin utilization in 2021, which comprised 39% of net interest revenue during 2021, growing from 19% of net interest revenue in 2020. Net interest revenue decreased $403 million, or 6%, in 2020 from 2019, due primarily to lower average investment yields, partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets and our acquisition of TD Ameritrade. Accelerated premium amortization on debt securities in 2020 also contributed to the reduction in net interest revenue, as the decline in long-term interest rates in 2020 resulted in higher prepayments of mortgage-related debt securities. Average interest-earning assets for 2020 were higher by 40%, compared to 2019. This increase in average interest-earning assets was primarily driven by higher client cash balances in bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients, due to higher client cash allocations and our acquisitions of TD Ameritrade and assets of USAA-IMCO. TD Ameritrade contributed approximately $12.0 billion of average interest-earning assets and $9.6 billion of average interest-bearing liabilities to Schwab’s full-year 2020 averages.Our net interest margin decreased to 1.62% in 2020, from 2.41% in 2019. This decrease was driven primarily by lower yields received on interest-earning assets due largely to the Federal Reserve’s 2019 and 2020 interest rate reductions as well as higher premium amortization on mortgage-related debt securities. Due to the low interest rate environment, purchases of investment securities in 2020 were made at rates below the average yield on the existing AFS portfolio, which negatively impacted our net interest margin. Asset Management and Administration FeesAsset management and administration fees include mutual fund, ETF, and CTF service fees and fees for other asset-based financial services provided to individual and institutional clients. Schwab earns mutual fund, ETF, and CTF service fees for shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. Asset management and administration fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in these funds and do not include securities lending revenues earned by proprietary mutual funds, ETFs, and CTFs, as those amounts, net of program fees, are credited to the fund shareholders. Proprietary CTFs may, but generally do not, directly participate in securities lending. The fair values of client assets included in proprietary and third-party mutual funds, ETFs, and CTFs are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data.We also earn asset management fees for advice solutions, which include managed portfolios, specialized strategies, and customized investment advice. Other asset management and administration fees include various asset-based fees such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, mutual fund clearing fees, and non-balance based service and transaction fees. Asset management and administration fees attributable to TD Ameritrade are primarily earned on client assets invested in money market mutual funds and other mutual funds, as well as advice solutions. Asset management and administration fees vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity. - 37 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)The following table presents asset management and administration fees, average client assets, and average fee yields:Year Ended December 31,202120202019AverageClientAssetsRevenueAverageFeeAverageClientAssetsRevenueAverageFeeAverageClientAssetsRevenueAverageFeeSchwab money market funds before fee waivers$155,821 $457 0.29 %$200,119 $605 0.30 %$173,558 $525 0.30 %Fee waivers(326)(127)— Schwab money market funds155,821 131 0.08 %200,119 478 0.24 %173,558 525 0.30 %Schwab equity and bond funds, ETFs, and CTFs423,999 380 0.09 %301,598 300 0.10 %267,213 298 0.11 %Mutual Fund OneSource® and other non- transaction fee funds229,342 724 0.32 %192,464 599 0.31 %191,552 606 0.32 %Other third-party mutual funds and ETFs (1,2)898,248 726 0.08 %525,379 393 0.07 %478,037 318 0.07 %Total mutual funds, ETFs, and CTFs (3)$1,707,410 1,961 0.11 %$1,219,560 1,770 0.15 %$1,110,360 1,747 0.16 %Advice solutions (3)Fee-based$452,503 1,993 0.44 %$306,010 1,443 0.47 %$246,888 1,198 0.49 %Non-fee-based89,911 — — 73,161 — — 70,191 — — Total advice solutions$542,414 1,993 0.37 %$379,171 1,443 0.38 %$317,079 1,198 0.38 %Other balance-based fees (4)614,787 259 0.04 %451,350 208 0.05 %432,613 216 0.05 %Other (5)61 54 50 Total asset management and administration fees$4,274 $3,475 $3,211 (1) Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, Schwab ETF OneSourceTM was discontinued as a result of the elimination of online trading commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed ETFs.(2) Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, includes third-party money funds related to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade.(3) Average client assets for advice solutions may also include the asset balances contained in the mutual fund and/or ETF categories listed above.(4) Includes various asset-related fees, such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, and mutual fund clearing fees and other service fees.(5) Includes miscellaneous service and transaction fees relating to mutual funds and ETFs that are not balance-based.Asset management and administration fees increased by $799 million, or 23%, in 2021 from 2020, due to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade, as well as additional growth in advice solutions and proprietary and third-party mutual funds and ETFs, which were due in part to strength in net new client assets and equity markets in 2021. These increases were partially offset by the effect of money market fund fee waivers due to lower portfolio yields as well as lower money market fund balances. Asset management and administration fees attributable to TD Ameritrade were $598 million in 2021 and $131 million from October 6, through December 31, 2020. The amount of fee waivers in coming quarters is dependent on a variety of factors, including the level of short-term interest rates and client preferences across our money market fund line-up. Asset management and administration fees increased by $264 million, or 8%, in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to higher balances in advice solutions, including managed account assets from USAA and TD Ameritrade, overall gains in equity markets, as well as higher purchased money market funds and other third-party mutual funds and ETFs, in 2020 relative to 2019. These increases were partially offset by the effect of money market fund fee waivers due to declining portfolio yields.The following table presents a roll forward of client assets for the Schwab money market funds, Schwab equity and bond funds, ETFs, and CTFs, and Mutual Fund OneSource® and other non-transaction fee (NTF) funds.

Commission revenue is affected by volume and mix of trades executed. Order flow revenue is comprised of rebate payments received from trade execution venues to which our broker-dealer subsidiaries send equity and option orders. Order flow revenue is affected by volume and mix of client trades, as well as pricing received from trade execution venues. Principal transaction revenue is recognized primarily as a result of accommodating clients’ fixed income trading activity, and includes adjustments to the fair value of securities positions held to facilitate such client trading activity.The following table presents trading revenue and related information:Year Ended December 31,Growth Rate2020-2021202120202019Trading Revenue193 %$4,152 $1,416 $752 Clients' daily average trades (DATs) (in thousands)150 %6,507.0 2,602.6 748.9 Number of trading days— 251.5 252.0 250.5 Revenue per trade (1)18 %$2.54 $2.16 $4.01 Note: Effective October 7, 2019, CS&Co eliminated online trade commissions for U.S. and Canadian-listed stocks and ETFs, as well as the base charge on options. TD Ameritrade, Inc. also does not charge for these types of trades and does not have a base charge on options.(1) Revenue per trade is calculated as trading revenue divided by DATs multiplied by the number of trading days.Trading revenue increased $2.7 billion, or 193% in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and heightened client engagement, which drove significantly higher DATs throughout 2021. This increased trading activity and a higher percentage of derivatives trades drove significant growth in commissions and order flow revenue. Overall, TD Ameritrade contributed $3.3 billion of trading revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with $667 million of trading revenue from October 6, 2020 through December 31, 2020.Trading revenue increased by $664 million, or 88%, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade. In addition, the Company saw a significant increase in DATs and higher order flow revenue in 2020, which were partially offset by the Company’s October 2019 pricing actions. Order flow revenue increased by $486 million in 2020 compared to 2019. This increase in order flow revenue in 2020 was due to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and a higher volume of trades throughout 2020 relative to 2019.Bank Deposit Account FeesIn connection with our acquisition of TD Ameritrade, the Company began earning bank deposit account fee revenue beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 pursuant to the IDA agreement and arrangements with other third-party banks. Bank deposit account fees are primarily affected by average BDA balances and the floating- and fixed-rate reference yields. Fees earned under the IDA agreement are affected by changes in interest rates and the composition of balances designated as fixed- and floating-rate. Bank deposit account fees totaled $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $355 million from October 6, 2020 through December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021 and the period of October 6, 2020 through December 31, 2020, the total average BDA balance was $158.4 billion and $161.3 billion, respectively, of which approximately 80% was designated as fixed-rate obligation amounts and approximately 20% as floating-rate obligation amounts for both periods. During 2021, the Company transferred $10.6 billion of BDA balances to its balance sheet from the TD Depository Institutions and other third-party banks. Transfers of BDA balances to Schwab’s balance sheet result in lower balances upon which bank deposit account fee revenue is earned but provide a source of funding to invest in interest-earning assets to increase net interest revenue. See also Capital Management and Item 8 – Note 15 for discussion of the IDA agreement and the potential to move IDA balances to Schwab’s balance sheet. Other RevenueOther revenue includes exchange processing fees, certain service fees, software fees, and non-recurring gains. Other revenue increased $417 million, or 126%, in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the full-year inclusion of TD Ameritrade’s results in 2021. Other revenue attributable to TD Ameritrade totaled $462 million and $110 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. - 39 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Other revenue increased $90 million, or 37%, in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to higher exchange processing fees resulting from higher trade volumes and the acquisition of TD Ameritrade.Total Expenses Excluding InterestThe following table shows a comparison of total expenses excluding interest:Growth Rate 2020-2021202120202019Compensation and benefitsSalaries and wages31 %$3,161 $2,416 $1,958 Incentive compensation55 %1,443 932 804 Employee benefits and other40 %846 606 558 Total compensation and benefits38 %$5,450 $3,954 $3,320 Professional services18 %994 843 702 Occupancy and equipment39 %976 703 559 Advertising and market development49 %485 326 307 Communications66 %587 353 253 Depreciation and amortization33 %549 414 322 Amortization of acquired intangible assetsN/M615 190 27 Regulatory fees and assessments69 %275 163 122 Other97 %876 445 261 Total expenses excluding interest46 %$10,807 $7,391 $5,873 Expenses as a percentage of total net revenuesCompensation and benefits29 %34 %31 %Advertising and market development3 %3 %3 %Full-time equivalent employees (in thousands)At year end4 %33.432.019.7Average36 %32.523.920.0N/M Not meaningful.

Total expenses excluding interest included amounts from TD Ameritrade of $3.1 billion in 2021 and $943 million in 2020 from October 6, through December 31, 2020. Adjusted total expenses, which excludes acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets, increased $3.0 billion, or 44%, in 2021 from 2020 and $939 million, or 16%, in 2020 from 2019. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results. Total compensation and benefits increased in 2021 from 2020 due to the inclusion of TD Ameritrade and growth in employee headcount. The 2021 increase reflected TDA’s full-year contribution of $1.2 billion of compensation and benefits expense compared with $453 million in 2020. The increase in 2021 was also due to additional headcount to support our expanding client base and service levels amidst heightened client engagement, a higher bonus accrual, annual merit increases, as well as a 5% employee salary increase and other targeted compensation adjustments that went into effect in late 2021. Total compensation and benefits expense increased from 2020 to 2019, primarily due to an overall increase in employee headcount related to our acquisitions of TDA and USAA-IMCO. The increase in 2020 from 2019 also reflected the Company’s payment of $1,000 to all non-officer employees in March 2020 to help them cover costs incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Compensation and benefits included acquisition and integration-related costs of $283 million and $235 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Professional services expense increased in 2021 from 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations and overall growth in the business. The increase in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to acquisition and integration-related costs in 2020 of $158 million. Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2021 from 2020, primarily due the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations, costs related to the integration of TD Ameritrade, and overall growth in the business. The increase in 2020 from 2019 was - 40 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)primarily due to the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations from October 6, 2020 forward, as well as an increase in technology equipment costs associated with higher client trade volumes and overall growth in the business.Advertising and market development expense increased in 2021 from 2020, primarily due the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations.Communications expense increased in 2021 from 2020 primarily due to the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations, as well as higher communications expense due to higher customer trade volumes and overall growth of the business. The increase in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations from October 6, 2020 forward and higher news and quotation services expenses due to higher trade volumes. Depreciation and amortization expenses grew in 2021 from 2020, primarily from growth in fixed assets from the TDA acquisition. As a result of capital expenditures to support growth in the business and the integration of TD Ameritrade, 2021 also reflected higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software and higher depreciation of hardware, as well as higher depreciation of buildings. The growth in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software, higher depreciation and amortization of equipment, office facilities, and property recognized in the TDA acquisition, as well as higher depreciation of buildings and equipment related to the expansion of our U.S. campuses in 2019 and 2020. As a result of significant capital expenditures in 2021 and anticipated for 2022 as described below, the Company expects to recognize higher depreciation and amortization expense in 2022. The periods over which depreciation and amortization are recognized on these capitalized costs are based on the expected useful lives of the types of assets capitalized and when the assets are placed into service.Amortization of acquired intangible assets increased in 2021 from 2020 and in 2020 from 2019 as a result of the acquisitions completed during 2020. Regulatory fees and assessments increased in 2021 from 2020, primarily as result of the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations and overall growth in the business, including higher FDIC assessments due to asset growth. The increase in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations from October 6, 2020 forward, and higher FDIC insurance assessments and other regulatory assessments due to growth in assets and overall growth of the business in 2020. Other expenses increased in 2021 from 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations and a charge of approximately $200 million for a regulatory matter in 2021 (see Item 8 – Note 15), partially offset by certain lower clearing charges and exchange fees. The increase in 2020 from 2019 was primarily from the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations from October 6, 2020 forward, and increases in processing fees and related expenses due to higher client trade volumes and market volatility. These increases were partially offset by lower travel and entertainment expense in 2020. Other expenses in 2020 included acquisition and integration-related costs of $30 million.Capital expenditures primarily include capitalized software costs, information technology and telecommunications equipment, and buildings. Total capital expenditures were $1.0 billion, $741 million, and $753 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures in 2021 from 2020 was primarily due to higher information technology and telecommunications equipment and higher capitalized software costs, partially offset by lower building expansion in 2021. The increases in spending in 2021 reflect investments made to support our TDA integration efforts and enhance our technological infrastructure to support greater capacity for our expanding client base. Capital expenditures decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower building expansion in 2020, largely offset by higher capitalized software costs. Capitalized software costs totaled $559 million, $453 million, and $188 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Investments in information technology and telecommunications equipment were $340 million, $60 million, and $81 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Investments in buildings were $102 million, $173 million, and $397 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Capital expenditures were 6% of total net revenues in 2021, within our estimated range for the year. In 2022, we will continue to invest to support the TDA integration and greater capacity for our expanding client base. We anticipate capital expenditures in 2022 will be approximately 4-5% of total net revenues. Our longer term expectation for capital expenditures remains in the range of 3-5% of total net revenues.- 41 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Taxes on IncomeSchwab’s effective income tax rate on income before taxes was 24.1% in 2021, 23.3% in 2020, and 23.6% in 2019. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2021 from 2020 was primarily related to non-recurring federal tax benefits recognized in 2020, including settlement of the IRS examination for tax years 2011-2014, the tax impact of a non-deductible regulatory matter charge in 2021 (see Item 8 – Note 15), and additional income tax expense from the filing of 2020 tax returns during 2021. Partially offsetting the increases in the effective tax rate from these items was an increase in equity compensation tax deduction benefits during 2021. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to federal and state tax benefits recognized during 2020, including settlement of the IRS examination of tax years 2011-2014, the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain federal and state uncertain tax positions, and tax benefits realized from the filing of state tax returns, as well as an increase in Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) benefits. Offsetting the decrease in the effective tax rate from these items was an increase in nondeductible acquisition costs and FDIC insurance premium disallowance, as well as a decrease in equity compensation tax deduction benefits. Segment InformationRevenues and expenses are attributed to the two segments based on which segment services the client. Management evaluates the performance of the segments on a pre-tax basis. Segment assets and liabilities are not used for evaluating segment performance or in deciding how to allocate resources to segments. Net revenues in both segments are generated from the underlying client assets and trading activity; differences in the composition of net revenues between the segments are based on the composition of client assets, client trading frequency, and pricing unique to each. While both segments leverage the scale and efficiency of our platforms, segment expenses reflect the dynamics of serving millions of clients in Investor Services versus the thousands of RIAs on the Advisor Services platform.The Company integrated its business and asset acquisitions during 2020 into its two existing reportable segments. Revenues and expenses from our acquisition of USAA-IMCO are allocated to Investor Services only; revenues and expenses from TD Ameritrade and our other 2020 acquisitions are attributed to both Investor Services and Advisor Services based on which segment services the client.

Percentage changes greater than 200% are presented as not meaningful.- 42 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Segment Net RevenuesInvestor Services and Advisor Services total net revenues increased by 68% and 32%, respectively, in 2021 compared to 2020. Both segments experienced growth in all revenue line items, primarily due to the full-year inclusion of TD Ameritrade’s results in 2021. In addition, net interest revenue increased for Advisor Services due to growth in interest-earning assets, partially offset by lower average yields. Growth in asset management and administration fees in Investor Services was supported by growth in advice solutions, and asset management and administration fees increased in both segments due to rising balances in proprietary and third-party mutual funds and ETFs, partially offset by money market fund fee waivers and lower money market fund balances. The increase in trading revenue for Investor Services was supported by heightened client trading activity. Bank deposit account fee revenue was earned at both segments for the full year in 2021 compared to only the fourth quarter of 2020, following the October 6, 2020 TD Ameritrade acquisition. Investor Services total net revenues increased by 13% in 2020 from 2019, while Advisor Services total net revenues remained relatively consistent year-over-year. Investor Services’ growth was primarily due to an increase in trading revenue, higher asset management and administration fees, and the initial recognition of bank deposit account fees in the fourth quarter of 2020, partially offset by lower net interest revenue. For Advisor Services, bank deposit account fees largely offset a decrease in net interest revenue, while trading revenue and asset management and administration fees were consistent with 2019. Trading revenue increased significantly in the Investor Services segment primarily due to the TD Ameritrade acquisition and higher trade volumes in 2020. Asset management and administration fees increased in 2020 for Investor Services primarily due to higher balances in advice solutions, including managed account assets from USAA and TD Ameritrade, as well as higher purchased money market funds and other third-party mutual funds and ETFs, partially offset by the effect of money fund fee waivers. Net interest revenue decreased for both segments primarily due to lower average investment yields, partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets. Segment Expenses Excluding InterestInvestor Services and Advisor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 50% and 35%, respectively, in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of TD Ameritrade’s results of operations. In addition, both segments saw higher compensation and benefits expenses due to additional headcount increases to support our expanding client base and service levels amidst heightened client engagement, higher bonus accrual, as well as annual merit increases and a 5% employee salary increase that went into effect late in the third quarter. For Investor Services, total expenses excluding interest also increased due to a charge of approximately $200 million in 2021 for a regulatory matter (see Item 8 – Note 15). Investor Services and Advisor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 29% and 17%, respectively, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the inclusion of TD Ameritrade’s expenses from October 6, 2020 forward and acquisition and integration-related costs. Compensation and benefits increased in both segments primarily due to the acquisition of TDA and overall headcount growth to support our expanding client base, with Investor Services increasing more significantly due to greater headcount growth from the TDA acquisition and the hiring of approximately 400 former USAA employees in connection with the USAA-IMCO acquisition. Both segments also saw increases in professional services, depreciation and amortization, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and other expenses, primarily due to the inclusion of TDA’s expenses from October 6, 2020 forward as well as acquisition and integration-related costs, with Investor Services’ expenses increasing more significantly due to overall size of the segment’s client base and greater client base growth from TDA.RISK MANAGEMENTSchwab’s business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks. The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that Schwab will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks.Our risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting, and risk mitigation controls; we use periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The activities and governance that comprise the risk management process are described below.- 43 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)As part of our integration of TD Ameritrade, the Company has aligned TD Ameritrade’s risk management practices with Schwab’s risk appetite. Our integration work included evaluating new or changed risks impacting the combined company, and taking action through various means. Though integration work continues, the Company’s operations, inclusive of TD Ameritrade, remain consistent with our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework.CultureThe Board of Directors has approved an ERM framework that incorporates our purpose, vision, and values, which form the bedrock of our corporate culture and set the tone for the organization.We designed the ERM Framework to enable a comprehensive approach to managing risks encountered by Schwab in its business activities. The framework incorporates key concepts commensurate with the size, risk profile, complexity, and continuing growth of the Company. Risk appetite, which is defined as the amount of risk the Company is willing to accept in pursuit of its corporate strategy, is developed by executive management and approved by the Board of Directors.Risk GovernanceSenior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling risks. The Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior executives from each major business and control function, is responsible for the oversight of risk management. This includes identifying emerging risks, assessing risk management practices and the control environment, reinforcing business accountability for risk management, supervisory controls and regulatory compliance, supporting resource prioritization across the organization, and escalating significant issues to the Board of Directors.We have established risk metrics and reporting that enable measurement of the impact of strategy execution against risk appetite. The risk metrics, with risk limits and tolerance levels, are established for key risk categories by the Global Risk Committee and its functional risk sub-committees.The Chief Risk Officer regularly reports activities of the Global Risk Committee to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. The Board Risk Committee in turn assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to our risk management program, including approving risk appetite statements and related key risk appetite metrics and reviewing reports relating to risk issues from functional areas of corporate risk management, legal, and internal audit.Functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report to the Global Risk Committee. These sub-committees include the:•Operational Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of and approves operational risk management policies, risk tolerance levels, and operational risk governance processes, and includes sub-committees covering Information Security, Technology, Fraud, Third-Party Risk, Data, and Model Governance;•Compliance Risk Committee – provides oversight of compliance risk management programs (inclusive of Anti-Money Laundering/Sanctions, Conduct, Fiduciary, and Privacy), policies, and risk tolerance levels providing an aggregate view of compliance risk exposure and employee conduct, including subcommittees covering Fiduciary and Conflicts of Interest Risk and International Compliance Risk;•Financial Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of and approves credit, market, liquidity, and capital risk policies, limits, and exposures; and•New Products and Services Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of, and approves corporate policy and procedures relating to, the risk governance of new products and services.Senior management has also created an Incentive Compensation Risk Oversight Committee, which establishes policy and reviews and approves the Annual Risk Assessment of incentive compensation plans, and reports directly to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Company’s finance, internal audit, legal, and corporate risk management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring risk management.- 44 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)In addition, the Disclosure Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.Operational RiskOperational risk arises due to potential inadequacies or failures related to people, internal processes, and systems, or from external events or relationships impacting the Company and/or any of its key business partners and third parties. While operational risk is inherent in all business activities, we rely on a system of internal controls and risk management practices designed to keep operational risk and operational losses within the Company’s risk appetite. We have specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and use control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. Where appropriate, we manage the impact of operational loss and litigation expense through the purchase of insurance. The insurance program is specifically designed to address our key operational risks and to maintain compliance with local laws and regulation.Schwab’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity and resilience of our critical business functions and technology systems. To the extent Schwab experiences business or system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, technological failure, cyber attacks, changes to systems, linkages with third-party systems, extreme weather, and power failures), our business and operations could be negatively impacted. To minimize business interruptions and ensure the capacity to continue operations during an incident regardless of duration, Schwab maintains a backup and recovery infrastructure which includes facilities for backup and communications, a geographically dispersed workforce, and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans and a well-established incident management program.Information Security risk is the risk of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, recording or destruction of the firm’s information or systems. We have designed and implemented an information security program that knits together complementary tools, controls and technologies to protect systems, client accounts and data. We continuously monitor the systems and work collaboratively with government agencies, law enforcement and other financial institutions to address potential threats. We use advanced monitoring systems to identify suspicious activity and deter unauthorized access by internal or external actors. We also maintain policies and procedures, which apply to employees, contractors, and third parties, regarding the standard of care expected with all data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-public client information. This includes limiting the number of employees who have access to clients’ personal information and internal authentication measures enforced to protect against the unauthorized use of employee credentials. All employees who handle sensitive information are trained in privacy and security. Schwab’s conduct and cybersecurity teams monitor activity looking for suspicious behavior. These capabilities allow us to identify and quickly act on attempted intrusions.Fraud risk arises from attempted or actual theft of financial assets or other property of any client or the Company. Schwab is committed to protecting the Company’s and its clients’ assets from fraud and complying with all applicable laws and regulations to prevent, detect and report fraudulent activity. Schwab manages fraud risk through policies, procedures and controls. We also take affirmative steps to prevent and detect fraud and report, to appropriate authorities, any known or suspected acts of fraud in accordance with existing laws and requirements.Schwab also faces operational risk when we employ the services of various third parties, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. We manage the exposure to third-party risk and promote a culture of resiliency through internal policies, procedures and controls, and contractual provisions, control standards, ongoing monitoring of third-party performance, and appropriate testing with third-party service providers. Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. Models are owned by several business units throughout the organization, and are used for a variety of purposes. Model use includes, but is not limited to, calculating capital requirements for hypothetical stressful environments, estimating interest and credit risk for loans and other balance sheet assets, and providing guidance in the management of client portfolios. We have established a policy that aligns with Federal Reserve guidance on Model Risk Management SR11-7 to describe the roles and responsibilities of all key stakeholders in model development, management, and use. All models are registered in a centralized database and classified into different risk ratings depending on their potential financial, reputational, or regulatory impact to the Company. The model risk rating determines the scope of model governance activities.- 45 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Incentive Compensation risk is the potential for adverse consequences resulting from compensation plans that do not balance the execution of our strategy with risk and financial rewards, potentially encouraging imprudent risk-taking by employees. We have implemented risk management processes, including a policy, to identify, evaluate, assess, and manage risks associated with incentive compensation plans and the activities of certain employees, defined as Covered Employees, who have the authority to expose the Company to material amounts of risk.Compliance RiskSchwab faces compliance risk which is the potential exposure to legal or regulatory sanctions, fines or penalties, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, or other regulatory requirements. Among other things, compliance risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of our controls. The Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, including SROs. We manage compliance risk through policies, procedures and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, privacy, and employment policies. Privacy risk is the risk of unauthorized collection, use, storage, or sharing of personal information, including data incidents and other mismanagement of personal information. We manage privacy risk through policies, procedures, and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with these laws and regulations.Anti-money laundering/Sanctions risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, fines or penalties, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) and Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)/global sanctions (collectively, “AML”) laws, regulations, rules, or other regulatory requirements. Schwab manages this risk through daily monitoring, a system of internal controls, education and training for appropriate personnel, and developing risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence and complying with beneficial ownership requirements for legal entity customers.Conduct risk arises from inappropriate, unethical, or unlawful behavior of the Company, its employees or third parties acting on the Company’s behalf that may result in detriment to the Company’s clients, financial markets, the Company, and/or the Company’s employees. We manage this risk through policies, procedures, a system of internal controls, including personnel monitoring and surveillance. Conduct-related matters are escalated through appropriate channels by the Corporate Responsibility Officer.Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. We manage this risk by establishing policy and procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the policy and procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees.Credit RiskCredit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations. Our exposure to credit risk mainly results from investing activities in our liquidity and investment portfolios, mortgage lending, margin lending and client option and futures activities, pledged asset lending, securities lending activities, and our role as a counterparty in other financial contracts. To manage the risks of such losses, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin, PAL, option, and futures requirements for certain securities and instruments. - 46 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Liquidity and Investment PortfoliosSchwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios, which include U.S. agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. state and municipal securities, commercial paper, and foreign government agency securities.At December 31, 2021, substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade. U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.Mortgage Lending PortfolioThe bank loan portfolio includes First Mortgages, HELOCs, PALs (discussed below), and other loans. The credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual loan and portfolio reviews. Management regularly reviews asset quality, including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses.Our residential loan underwriting guidelines include maximum LTV ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan size is conforming or jumbo). Schwab does not originate or purchase residential loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. For more information on credit quality indicators relating to Schwab’s bank loans, see Item 8 – Note 7. Securities and Instrument-Based Lending PortfoliosCollateral arrangements relating to margin loans, PALs, option and futures positions, securities lending agreements, and securities purchased under agreements to resell (resale agreements) include provisions that require additional collateral in the event of market fluctuations. Additionally, for margin loans, PALs, options and futures positions, and securities lending agreements, collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral sufficiently exceeds the credit exposure in order to maintain a fully secured position.Other Counterparty ExposuresSchwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab’s clients or a counterparty fail to meet their obligations to the Company.Market RiskMarket risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by Schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, or market conditions. Schwab is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates within our interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of funding sources that finance these assets. To manage interest rate risk, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting limits on net interest revenue risk and economic value of equity (EVE) risk. To remain within these limits, we manage the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios. Management monitors established guidelines to stay within the Company’s risk appetite.Our measurement of interest rate risk involves assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue, bank deposit account fees, or EVE. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, - 47 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies, including changes in asset and liability mix. Financial instruments are also subject to the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument. We are indirectly exposed to option, futures, and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option and futures accounts, securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers, and client securities loaned out as part of the brokerage securities lending activities. Equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity, margin borrowing, and overall client engagement with Schwab. Additionally, we earn mutual fund and ETF service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets. Fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue we earn.Our market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material. Interest Rate Risk SimulationsNet Interest Revenue SimulationFor our net interest revenue sensitivity analysis, we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulations include all balance sheet interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities. Key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, repricing of financial instruments, and reinvestment of matured or paid-down securities and loans. Net interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may reprice at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short- and long-term interest rates. Interest-earning assets include investment securities, margin loans, and bank loans. These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment. Because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans, and control the composition of our investment securities, we have some ability to manage our net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions.Net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment. The following table shows the simulated change to net interest revenue over the next 12 months beginning December 31, 2021 and 2020 of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period:December 31,20212020Increase of 100 basis points14.1%14.2%Decrease of 100 basis points(4.5)%(4.3)%The Company’s simulated increase of 100 basis points in market interest rates had a slightly lower impact on net interest revenue at year-end 2021 compared with year-end 2020 due to an increase in the Company’s projected repricing of client deposit rates across higher market interest rate scenarios, which was partially offset as a result of holding a higher allocation of floating-rate assets on the balance sheet at December 31, 2021 relative to the prior year-end. A simulated decrease of 100 basis points in market interest rates had a slightly larger impact year-over-year primarily as a result of holding a higher allocation of floating-rate assets.Higher short-term interest rates would positively impact net interest revenue as yields on interest-earning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources. A decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the Company’s investment and loan portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources, compressing net interest margin. - 48 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)In addition to measuring the effect of a gradual 100 basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates, we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel- and non-parallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue.Bank Deposit Account Fees SimulationConsistent with the presentation on the consolidated statement of income, the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to interest rate changes is assessed separately from the net interest revenue simulation described above. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, simulated changes in bank deposit account fee revenue from gradual 100 basis point changes in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates did not have a significant impact on the Company’s total net revenues. Economic Value of Equity SimulationManagement also uses EVE simulations to measure interest rate risk. EVE sensitivity measures the long-term impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates. This analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment. Key assumptions in our EVE calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, term structure models of interest rates, non-maturity deposit behavior, and pricing assumptions. Our net interest revenue, bank deposit account fee revenue, and EVE simulations reflect the assumption of non-negative investment yields.Phase-out of LIBORThe Company continues to prepare for the phasing-out of LIBOR, undertaking many efforts coordinated by its firm-wide transition team. The LIBOR transition team is overseen by executive leadership and has organized its efforts to address both client-impacting and non-client-impacting workstreams. From a client perspective, the Company has established pages on the client-facing websites for CS&Co and TD Ameritrade, Inc. to provide information for our clients to help them understand how they may be impacted by LIBOR’s discontinuation. In addition, we maintain internal informational resources for our client-facing employees’ awareness regarding LIBOR’s phase-out. The Company’s largest exposures to LIBOR are certain investment securities and loans. In purchasing new investment securities, we ensure that appropriate fallback language is in place in the event that LIBOR becomes unavailable or is deemed unreliable, and we have sold certain securities lacking appropriate fallback language. Additionally, in accordance with regulatory feedback, we are limiting our purchases of LIBOR-based securities, and we ensure that any new purchases of LIBOR-based securities were issued prior to January 1, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, substantially all of the Company’s remaining investment securities with exposure to LIBOR provide for appropriate fallback in the event LIBOR is no longer available. Consistent with guidance from the Alternative Reference Rate Committee, a group of private-market participants jointly convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to help ensure a successful transition from LIBOR, the Company phased-out the use of LIBOR as a reference rate in new loans prior to year-end 2021, and the Company’s portfolio of legacy loans have fallback language if LIBOR is no longer available.Certain of the Company’s technology systems and financial models have historically utilized LIBOR, and we have now substantially transitioned our financial models and systems to alternative reference rates. In addition, we have transitioned the Company’s IDA agreement and certain intercompany lending agreements that previously were tied to LIBOR to other appropriate reference rates. Additional transition efforts to prepare for the phasing-out of LIBOR are ongoing. The floating dividend rates for our Series A, E, and F preferred stock are based on LIBOR. In addition, operational work remains to transition our legacy loan portfolio, in accordance with expected regulatory guidance, to alternate reference rates that are consistent with the fallback language included in the contracts. Liquidity RiskLiquidity risk is the potential that Schwab will be unable to sell assets or meet cash flow obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses.- 49 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Due to its role as a source of financial strength, CSC’s liquidity needs are primarily driven by the liquidity and capital needs of: CS&Co, TD Ameritrade, Inc., and TDAC, our principal broker-dealer subsidiaries; the capital needs of the banking subsidiaries; principal and interest due on corporate debt; dividend payments on CSC’s preferred stock; and returns of capital to common stockholders. The liquidity needs of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are primarily driven by client activity including trading and margin lending activities and capital expenditures. The capital needs of the banking subsidiaries are primarily driven by client deposit levels. We have established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies, while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions. We seek to maintain client confidence in the balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the Company to meet its obligations. To this end, we have established limits and contingency funding scenarios to support liquidity levels during both business as usual and stressed conditions.We employ a variety of methodologies to monitor and manage liquidity. We conduct regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific liquidity stress events. Liquidity is also tested at certain subsidiaries and results are reported to the Financial Risk Oversight Committee. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the organization and are reviewed with management as appropriate.Primary Funding SourcesSchwab’s primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity which includes bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts. These funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients. Other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, repayments on loans, securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts, repurchase agreements, and cash provided by external financing.To meet daily funding needs, we maintain liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments. For unanticipated liquidity needs, we also maintain a buffer of highly liquid investments, including U.S. Treasury securities.Additional Funding SourcesIn addition to internal sources of liquidity, Schwab has access to external funding. The need for short-term borrowings from external debt facilities arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest-earning investments, movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements, and general corporate purposes. We maintain policies and procedures necessary to access funding and test discount window borrowing procedures on a periodic basis.The following table describes external debt facilities available at December 31, 2021:DescriptionBorrowerOutstandingAvailableFederal Home Loan Bank secured credit facilitiesBanking subsidiaries$— $63,476 Federal Reserve discount windowBanking subsidiaries— 11,957 Uncommitted, unsecured lines of credit with various external banksCSC, CS&Co— 1,522 Unsecured commercial paper (1)CSC3,006 1,994 Committed, unsecured credit facility with various external banksTDAC— 600 Secured uncommitted lines of credit with various external banks (2)TDAC1,850 — (1) In October 2021, the Company increased the amount of commercial paper available to issue from $1.5 billion to $5.0 billion.(2) Secured borrowing capacity is made available based on TDAC’s ability to provide acceptable collateral to the lenders as determined by the credit agreements.Our banking subsidiaries maintain secured credit facilities with the FHLB. Amounts available under these facilities are dependent on the value of our First Mortgages, HELOCs, and the fair value of certain of our investment securities that are pledged as collateral. These credit facilities are also available as backup financing in the event the outflow of client cash from the banking subsidiaries’ respective balance sheets is greater than maturities and paydowns on investment securities and bank loans. - 50 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Our banking subsidiaries also have access to short-term secured funding through the Federal Reserve discount window. Amounts available under the Federal Reserve discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral. Our banking subsidiaries may also engage with external banks in repurchase agreements collateralized by investments securities as another source of short-term liquidity. CSC has a commercial paper program of which proceeds are used for general corporate purposes. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes may vary, but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue. CSC’s ratings for these short-term borrowings were P1 by Moody’s, A1 by Standard & Poor’s, and F1 by Fitch at December 31, 2021 and 2020. CSC also has a universal automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, which enables it to issue debt, equity, and other securities. CS&Co maintains uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines with a group of banks as a source of short-term liquidity, which can also be accessed by CSC. TDAC maintains a senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $600 million, which matures in April 2022. TDAC also maintains secured uncommitted lines of credit, under which TDAC borrows on either a demand or short-term basis and pledges client margin securities as collateral. To support growth in margin loan balances at our broker-dealer subsidiaries while meeting our LCR requirements, the Company issues commercial paper or draws on secured lines of credit, in addition to capital markets issuances.Liquidity Coverage RatioBeginning October 1, 2021, Schwab became subject to the full (100%) LCR, which requires the Company to hold HQLA in an amount equal to at least 100% of the Company’s projected net cash outflows over a prospective 30-calendar-day period of acute liquidity stress, calculated each business day. See Item 1 – Regulation for additional information.

For information on our contractual obligations for credit-related financial instruments, short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and leases, see Part II, Item 8 – Notes 15, 13, and 14, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had total short-term purchase obligations of $484 million and total long-term purchase obligations of $532 million. - 52 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Schwab also enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements in the ordinary course of business. For information on these arrangements, see Item 8 – Notes 7, 11, 13, 15, and 17. Pursuant to the IDA agreement, certain brokerage client deposits are required to be swept off-balance sheet to the TD Depository Institutions. We also maintain agreements pursuant to which certain client brokerage cash deposits are swept to other third-party depository institutions. See Item 8 – Notes 3 and 15 for additional information on the IDA agreement.CAPITAL MANAGEMENT Schwab seeks to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support execution of our business strategy, including anticipated balance sheet growth inclusive of migration of IDA balances (see further discussion below), providing financial support to our subsidiaries, and sustained access to the capital markets, while at the same time meeting our regulatory capital requirements and serving as a source of financial strength to our banking subsidiaries. Schwab’s primary sources of capital are funds generated by the operations of subsidiaries and securities issuances by CSC in the capital markets. To ensure that Schwab has sufficient capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values, we have adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios. Internal guidelines are set, for both CSC and its regulated subsidiaries, to ensure capital levels are in line with our strategy and regulatory requirements. Capital forecasts are reviewed monthly at Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee and Financial Risk Oversight Committee meetings. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify potential problems that could impact capital. In addition, we monitor the subsidiaries’ capital levels and requirements. Subject to regulatory capital requirements and any required approvals, any excess capital held by subsidiaries is transferred to CSC in the form of dividends and returns of capital. When subsidiaries have need of additional capital, funds are provided by CSC as equity investments and also as subordinated loans (in a form approved as regulatory capital by regulators) for CS&Co. The details and method used for each cash infusion are based on an analysis of the particular entity’s needs and financing alternatives. The amounts and structure of infusions must take into consideration maintenance of regulatory capital requirements, debt/equity ratios, and equity double leverage ratios.Schwab conducts regular capital stress testing to assess the potential financial impacts of various adverse macroeconomic and company-specific events to which the Company could be subjected. The objective of the capital stress testing is (1) to explore various potential outcomes – including rare and extreme events and (2) to assess impacts of potential stressful outcomes on both capital and liquidity. Additionally, we have a comprehensive Capital Contingency Plan to provide action plans for certain low probability/high impact capital events that the Company might face. The Capital Contingency Plan is issued under the authority of the Financial Risk Oversight Committee and provides guidelines for sustained capital events. It does not specifically address every contingency, but is designed to provide a framework for responding to any capital stress. The results of the stress testing indicate there are two scenarios which could stress the Company’s capital: (1) inflows of balance sheet cash during a period of very low interest rates and (2) outflows of balance sheet cash when other sources of financing are not available and the Company is required to sell assets to fund the flows at a loss. The Capital Contingency Plan is reviewed annually and updated as appropriate.For additional information, see Business – Regulation in Part I, Item 1.Regulatory Capital RequirementsCSC is subject to capital requirements set by the Federal Reserve and is required to serve as a source of strength for our banking subsidiaries and to provide financial assistance if our banking subsidiaries experience financial distress. Schwab is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for CSC of at least 4%, and we have a long-term operating objective of 6.75%-7.00%. Due to the relatively low risk of our balance sheet assets and risk-based capital ratios at CSC and CSB that are well in excess of regulatory requirements, the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint on CSC’s asset growth.Our banking subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements set by their regulators that are substantially similar to those imposed on CSC by the Federal Reserve. Our banking subsidiaries’ failure to remain well capitalized could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that could have a direct material effect on the banks. Schwab’s principal banking subsidiary, CSB, is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of at least 5% to be well capitalized, but seeks to maintain a ratio of at least 6.25%. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2021, CSB is considered well capitalized.- 53 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)CSB is also subject to regulatory requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions. In addition, CSB is required to provide notice to, and may be required to obtain approval from, the Federal Reserve and the Texas Department of Savings and Mortgage Lending (TDSML) to declare dividends to CSC. As broker-dealers, CS&Co, TDAC, and TD Ameritrade, Inc., are subject to regulatory requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule, which is intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit the broker-dealer subsidiaries from paying cash dividends, making unsecured advances and loans to CSC and employees, and repaying subordinated borrowings from CSC if such payment would result in a net capital amount below prescribed thresholds. At December 31, 2021, CS&Co, TDAC, and TD Ameritrade, Inc. were in compliance with their respective net capital requirements.In addition to the capital requirements above, Schwab’s subsidiaries are subject to other regulatory requirements intended to ensure financial soundness and liquidity. See Item 8 – Note 23 for additional information on the components of stockholders’ equity and information on the capital requirements of significant subsidiaries.The following table details the capital ratios for CSC consolidated and CSB:December 31,20212020CSCCSBCSCCSBTotal stockholders’ equity$56,261 $27,035 $56,060 $22,223 Less:Preferred stock9,954 — 7,733 — Common Equity Tier 1 Capital before regulatory adjustments$46,307 $27,035 $48,327 $22,223 Less:Goodwill, net of associated deferred tax liabilities$11,857 $13 $11,897 $13 Other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities7,579 — 8,103 — Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances and deferred tax liabilities13 12 17 12 AOCI adjustment(1,109)(1,004)5,394 4,672 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital $27,967 $28,014 $22,916 $17,526 Tier 1 Capital$37,921 $28,014 $30,649 $17,526 Total Capital37,950 28,033 30,688 17,558 Risk-Weighted Assets141,969 104,409 123,881 91,062 Total Leverage Exposure614,466 400,532 491,469 325,437 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital/Risk-Weighted Assets19.7 %26.8 %18.5 %19.2 %Tier 1 Capital/Risk-Weighted Assets26.7 %26.8 %24.7 %19.2 %Total Capital/Risk-Weighted Assets26.7 %26.8 %24.8 %19.3 %Tier 1 Leverage Ratio6.2 %7.1 %6.3 %5.5 %Supplementary Leverage Ratio6.2 %7.0 %6.2 %5.4 %As a result of significant inflows of client cash in 2020, our Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for consolidated CSC and CSB declined below our long-term operating objectives. In 2021, the Company’s issuances of preferred stock and strength in earnings helped to largely maintain our Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, even as bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients grew by a total of $107.2 billion, or 23%, during the year. We ended 2021 with a consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 6.2%, down slightly from the prior year-end of 6.3%. Earnings in 2021 as well as capital contributions from CSC drove an increase in CSB’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio from 5.5% at year-end 2020 to 7.1% at year-end 2021. Though our Tier 1 Leverage Ratio is below our long-term operating objective for consolidated CSC, this ratio is well above the regulatory minimum. The pace of return to our long-term operating objective over time depends on a number of factors including the overall size of the Company’s balance sheet, earnings, and capital issuance and deployment. IDA AgreementThrough December 31, 2021, Schwab had moved $10.1 billion of IDA balances to its balance sheet, which included uninsured balances and certain international account balances. The Company’s overall capital management strategy includes supporting migration of IDA balances in future periods as available pursuant to the terms of the IDA agreement. The Company’s ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent upon multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain - 54 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)these incremental deposits and the availability of IDA balances designated as floating-rate obligations. See Item 8 – Note 15 for further information on the IDA agreement.DividendsSince the initial dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 131 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend rate 25 times, resulting in a 20% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, CSC currently targets its common and nonvoting common stock cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income.The Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend increase per common share during 2020 as shown below:Date of DeclarationQuarterly Cash Increase Per Common Share% IncreaseNew Quarterly Dividend Per Common ShareJanuary 30, 2020$0.01 6 %$0.18 In addition, on January 26, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a two cent, or 11%, increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.20 per common share.The following table details the CSC cash dividends paid and per share amounts:Year Ended December 31,20212020Cash PaidPer ShareAmountCash PaidPer ShareAmountCommon and Nonvoting Common Stock$1,366 $0.72 $1,039 $0.72 Series A Preferred Stock (1)28 70.00 28 70.00 Series C Preferred Stock (2)18 30.00 36 60.00 Series D Preferred Stock (3)45 59.52 45 59.52 Series E Preferred Stock (4)28 4,625.00 28 4,625.00 Series F Preferred Stock (5)25 5,000.00 25 5,000.00 Series G Preferred Stock (6)134 5,375.00 79 3,150.35 Series H Preferred Stock (7)97 3,888.89 N/AN/ASeries I Preferred Stock (8)63 2,811.11 N/AN/ASeries J Preferred Stock (9)18 29.80 N/AN/A(1) Dividends paid semi-annually until February 1, 2022 and quarterly thereafter.(2) Series C Preferred Stock was redeemed on June 1, 2021.

The authorization does not have an expiration date. There were no repurchases of CSC’s common stock under this authorization during the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020. As of December 31, 2021, $1.8 billion remained on our existing authorization.- 55 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)FOREIGN EXPOSUREAt December 31, 2021, Schwab had exposure to non-sovereign financial and non-financial institutions in foreign countries, as well as agencies of foreign governments. At December 31, 2021, the fair value of these holdings totaled $12.5 billion, with the top three exposures being to issuers and counterparties domiciled in the United Kingdom at $5.2 billion, France at $3.9 billion, and Sweden at $754 million. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of these holdings totaled $10.1 billion, with the top three exposures being to issuers and counterparties domiciled in France at $6.7 billion, Germany at $1.2 billion, and Canada at $880 million. In addition, Schwab had outstanding margin loans to foreign residents of $3.3 billion and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSSchwab uses the market approach to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, and to determine fair value disclosures. See Item 8 – Notes 2 and 18 for more information on our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe consolidated financial statements of Schwab have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Item 8 – Note 2 contains more information on our significant accounting policies made in applying these accounting principles.While the majority of the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on Schwab’s financial position and financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy.Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Additionally, management has reviewed with the Audit Committee the Company’s significant estimates discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Income TaxesSchwab estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, including federal, state and local domestic jurisdictions, and immaterial amounts owed to several foreign jurisdictions. The estimated income tax expense is reported in the consolidated statements of income in taxes on income. Accrued taxes are reported in other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to future periods. Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. In estimating accrued taxes, we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position. Because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations, interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances.Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be significant to the operating results of the Company. See Item 8 – Note 22 for more information on the Company’s income taxes.- 56 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Legal and Regulatory ReservesReserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved. See Item 8 – Note 15 for more information on the Company’s contingencies related to legal and regulatory reserves.Business CombinationsWe have accounted for our acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date as we allocate the purchase price to the estimated fair values of acquired tangible and intangible assets and the liabilities assumed. We also use our best estimates to determine the useful lives of the tangible and definite-lived intangible assets, which impact the periods over which depreciation and amortization of those assets are recognized. These best estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain as they pertain to forward looking views of our businesses, client behavior, and market conditions. In our acquisitions, we have also recognized goodwill at the amount by which the purchase price paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. See Item 8 – Notes 2 and 3 for more information on our valuation methods and the results of applying the acquisition method of accounting, including the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and, where relevant, the estimated remaining useful lives.Our ongoing accounting for goodwill and the tangible and intangible assets acquired requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions as we exercise judgement to evaluate these assets for impairment. Our processes and accounting policies for evaluating impairments are further described in Item 8 – Note 2. One of our reporting units has an immaterial amount of goodwill. The results of the 2021 annual goodwill impairment testing for our other two reporting units indicated that the estimated fair values substantially exceeded their carrying amounts.- 57 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESIn addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP), Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain references to the non-GAAP financial measures described below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information about the financial performance of the Company, and facilitate meaningful comparison of Schwab’s results in the current period to both historic and future results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. Schwab’s use of non-GAAP measures is reflective of certain adjustments made to GAAP financial measures as described below. Non-GAAP Adjustment or MeasureDefinitionUsefulness to Investors and Uses by Management Acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assetsSchwab adjusts certain GAAP financial measures to exclude the impact of acquisition and integration-related costs incurred as a result of the Company’s acquisitions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and, where applicable, the income tax effect of these expenses. Adjustments made to exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets are reflective of all acquired intangible assets, which were recorded as part of purchase accounting. These acquired intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation. Amortization of acquired intangible assets will continue in future periods over their remaining useful lives.We exclude acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets for the purpose of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe doing so provides additional transparency of Schwab’s ongoing operations, and is useful in both evaluating the operating performance of the business and facilitating comparison of results with prior and future periods. Acquisition and integration-related costs fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and integration activities, thereby limiting comparability of results among periods, and are not representative of the costs of running the Company’s ongoing business. Amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded because management does not believe it is indicative of the Company’s underlying operating performance.Return on tangible common equityReturn on tangible common equity represents annualized adjusted net income available to common stockholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity. Tangible common equity represents common equity less goodwill, acquired intangible assets – net, and related deferred tax liabilities.Acquisitions typically result in the recognition of significant amounts of goodwill and acquired intangible assets. We believe return on tangible common equity may be useful to investors as a supplemental measure to facilitate assessing capital efficiency and returns relative to the composition of Schwab’s balance sheet. The Company also uses adjusted diluted EPS and return on tangible common equity as components of performance criteria for employee bonus and certain executive management incentive compensation arrangements. The Compensation Committee of CSC’s Board of Directors maintains discretion in evaluating performance against these criteria.The following tables present reconciliations of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures:Year Ended December 31,202120202019Total expenses excluding interest (GAAP)$10,807 $7,391 $5,873 Acquisition and integration-related costs (1)(468)(442)(26)Amortization of acquired intangible assets(615)(190)(27)Adjusted total expenses (non-GAAP)$9,724 $6,759 $5,820 (1) Acquisition and integration-related costs for 2021 primarily consist of $283 million of compensation and benefits, $132 million of professional services, and $39 million of occupancy and equipment.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskFor a discussion of the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see Risk Management in Part II, Item 7.- 59 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION",2023-12-30 18:56:08.840803
316709,SCHW,SCHWAB CHARLES CORP,2023,"Item 7.Economic and Market RisksDevelopments in the business, economic, and geopolitical environment could negatively impact our business.Our business can be adversely affected by the general environment – economic, corporate, securities market, regulatory, and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations, trading activity, interest rates, and overall investor engagement, and are outside of our control. Deterioration in the housing and credit markets, reduction in interest rates, and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact our results of operations and capital resources.The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States, have a significant effect on our operating results. Actions taken by the Federal Reserve, including changes in its target funds rate and balance sheet management, are difficult to predict and can affect our net interest revenue and bank deposit account fees. These - 12 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONpolicies could also have implications for clients’ allocation to cash; higher or lower client cash balances have an impact on our capital requirements as well as liquidity implications if such changes in allocation are sudden.A significant change in client cash allocations could negatively impact our income.We rely heavily on client cash balances to generate revenue. Cash awaiting investment in a portion of our client brokerage accounts is swept to our banking subsidiaries and those bank deposits are then used to extend loans to clients and purchase investment securities. We also sweep a portion of such cash to unconsolidated third-party financial institutions, including pursuant to the IDA agreement, through which we earn bank deposit account fees. A significant reduction in our clients’ allocation to cash, a change in the allocation of that cash, or a transfer of cash away from the Company, could reduce our income. Significant interest rate changes could affect our profitability.The direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings. A decline in interest rates may have a negative impact on our net interest revenue and our bank deposit account fee revenue. A low interest rate environment may also have a negative impact on our asset management and administration fee revenues when we have to waive a portion of our management fees for certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds in order to continue providing a positive return to clients. Although we believe our net interest revenue will increase in a rising interest rate environment, a rise in interest rates may cause our funding costs to increase if market conditions or the competitive environment induces us to raise our interest rates to avoid losing deposits, or replace deposits with higher cost funding sources without offsetting increases in yields on interest-earning assets which can reduce the benefit to our net interest revenue.The announced phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) could negatively impact our net interest revenue and will continue to require operational work.Certain securities in our investment portfolio, the floating rate loans we offered, and a series of our outstanding preferred stock reference LIBOR as the benchmark rate to determine the applicable interest rate, payment amount or floating dividend rates. While we have substantially transitioned our financial models and systems away from LIBOR, in limited circumstances we still use LIBOR. The Federal Reserve adopted a final rule that provides default rules for certain contracts that use LIBOR, with replacement rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). When LIBOR is discontinued as announced, there will be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments and the details of any fallback provisions. This could result in different financial performance for previously booked transactions. The calculation of interest rates under the replacement benchmarks could also impact our net interest revenue. LIBOR may also perform differently during the phase-out period than in the past which could result in lower interest payments and a reduction in the value of certain securities in our investment portfolio. In addition, further operational work will be required to transition our legacy loan portfolio to alternate reference rates. See also Part II – Item 7 – Risk Management for additional information regarding the Company’s consideration of the phase-out of LIBOR. Compliance RisksExtensive regulation of our businesses may subject us to significant penalties or limitations on business activities.As a participant in the securities, banking, and financial services industries, we are subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and foreign laws by governmental agencies, supervisory authorities and SROs. The costs and uncertainty related to complying with such regulations continue to increase. These regulations affect our business operations and impose capital, client protection, and market conduct requirements on us as well as restrictions on the activities that we are allowed to conduct. We become subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny as we grow. Regulators have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies and could prevent us from pursuing our business strategy. Regulators could also limit our ability to grow, including adding assets, launching new products, making acquisitions, and undertaking strategic investments. Our banking regulators could require CSC and/or our banking subsidiaries to hold more capital, increase liquidity, or limit their ability to pay dividends or CSC’s ability to repurchase or redeem shares. Despite our efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements, there are a number of risks, particularly in areas where applicable laws or regulations may be unclear or where regulators could revise their previous guidance. Any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by our regulators against us or our affiliates, officers or employees could result in fines, penalties, cease and desist orders, enforcement actions, suspension, disqualification or expulsion, - 13 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONor other disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on our business activities, any of which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.While we maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, violations could occur. In addition, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time. There may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance, including restrictions on certain activities. Such a finding may also damage our reputation and our relationships with our regulators and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities.Legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively affect our business and financial results.New legislation, rules, regulations and guidance, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal, state, foreign and SRO rules, regulations and guidance, including changes relating to mutual funds, money market funds, standards of conduct with clients, conflicts of interest, regulatory treatment of deposit accounts, CRA, and market structure reform, including order routing practices and order-related revenues, may directly affect our operations and profitability or our specific business lines. Recently, the SEC has proposed or adopted a number of new rules, and these new or proposed rules involve sweeping changes that could require significant shifts in industry operations and practices, thereby increasing uncertainty for markets and investors. Our profitability could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes to the laws governing taxation, electronic commerce, client privacy and security of client data. In addition, the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business we conduct, modifications to our business practices, more stringent capital and liquidity requirements, increased deposit insurance assessments or additional costs and could limit our ability to return capital to stockholders. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to our compliance, risk management, treasury and operations functions.Failure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect our financial condition.CSC, together with its banking, broker-dealer, and FCM/FDM subsidiaries, must meet certain capital and liquidity standards, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about the adequacy of our capital and our internal assessment of our capital needs. The Uniform Net Capital Rule limits the ability of our broker-dealer entities to transfer capital to CSC and other affiliates. New regulatory capital, liquidity, capital planning, and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including paying dividends, stock repurchases, and redemptions, and may require us to increase our capital and/or liquidity or to limit our growth. Failure by either CSC or its banking subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a negative impact on us. In addition, failure by CSC or our banking subsidiaries to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to satisfy their stress capital buffer (CSC) or capital conservation buffer (banking subsidiaries) and countercyclical capital buffer requirements would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers. Any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital, replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as Tier 1 Capital, or increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity, could require us to liquidate assets, deleverage or otherwise change our business and/or investment plans, which may adversely affect our financial results. Issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders.In 2022, CSC became subject to the CCAR process, which requires submission of an annual capital plan, and determination of CSC’s stress capital buffer. The plan must include a description of all planned capital actions, including dividends or stock repurchases, over a nine-quarter planning horizon beginning with the first quarter of the calendar year the capital plan is submitted. CSC’s risk-based capital ratios must exceed the regulatory minimum plus the stress capital buffer. The stress capital buffer could make us subject to progressively more stringent constraints on capital actions if we approach our minimum ratios. This could lead to restrictions on our ability to pay or increase dividends or otherwise return capital to stockholders.If the average of CSC’s total consolidated assets for four consecutive calendar quarters reaches $700 billion, or if the average of cross-jurisdictional activity for four consecutive calendar quarters reaches $75 billion, CSC will become subject to more stringent Category II requirements, including annual stress testing, the advanced approaches framework, and the inability to opt out of including AOCI in regulatory capital calculations. At December 31, 2022, CSC had approximately $552 billion in total assets and cross-jurisdictional activity of approximately $29 billion. - 14 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONWe are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending against claims or proceedings.The financial services industry faces significant litigation and regulatory risks. We are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages. We are also the subject of inquiries, investigations, and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies.Litigation and arbitration claims include those brought by our clients and the clients of third-party advisors whose assets are custodied with us. Claims from clients of third-party advisors may allege losses due to investment decisions made by the third-party advisors or the advisors’ misconduct. Litigation claims also include claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights (e.g., patents). Such litigation can require the expenditure of significant company resources. If we were found to have infringed on a third-party patent, or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial damages, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology, or providing certain products or services.Actions brought against us may result in settlements, awards, injunctions, fines, penalties or other results adverse to us, including reputational harm. Even if we are successful in defending against these actions, the defense of such matters may result in us incurring significant expenses. A substantial judgment, settlement, fine, or penalty could be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular future period, depending on our results for that period. In market downturns and periods of heightened volatility, the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased. Operational RiskSecurity breaches of our systems, or those of our clients or third parties, may subject us to significant liability and damage our reputation. Our business involves the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential information about our clients and us. Information security risks for financial institutions are increasing, in part because of the use of the internet and mobile and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, activists, hackers and other external parties, including foreign state actors. Our systems and those of other financial institutions have been and will continue to be the target of cyber attacks, malicious code, computer viruses, ransomware, and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, for example, employee misconduct.Given the high volume of transactions that we process, the large number of clients, counterparties and third-party service providers with which we do business, including cloud service providers, and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks, a cyber attack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected. The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before an investigation is completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known. During such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.Security breaches, including breaches of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers or clients, could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject us to significant liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance, actions by our regulators, damage to our reputation, or a loss of confidence in our security measures which could harm our business. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures.We also face risk related to external fraud involving the misappropriation and use of clients’ user names, passwords or other personal information to gain access to our clients’ financial accounts. This could occur from the compromise of clients’ personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company where clients’ personal information is taken and then made available to fraudsters. Such risk has grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties, including foreign state-sponsored parties. Losses reimbursed to clients under our - 15 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONguarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Technology and operational failures or errors and other operational risks could subject us to losses, litigation, regulatory actions, and reputational damage.We must process, record and monitor a large number of transactions and our operations are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology systems and our ability to make timely enhancements and additions to our systems. System interruptions, errors or downtime can result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to our systems, linkages with third-party systems and power failures and can have a significant impact on our business and operations. Our systems are vulnerable to disruptions from human error, execution errors, errors in models such as those used for asset management, capital planning and management, risk management, stress testing and compliance, employee misconduct, unauthorized trading, external fraud, computer viruses, distributed denial of service attacks, cyber attacks, terrorist attacks, natural disaster, extreme weather, power outage, capacity constraints, software flaws, events impacting key business partners and vendors, and similar events. For example, we and other financial institutions have been the target of various denial of service attacks that have, in certain circumstances, made websites, mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time. Cloud technologies are critical to the operation of our systems and platforms and our reliance on cloud technologies is growing. Cloud service disruptions may lead to delays in accessing data that is important to our businesses and may hinder our clients’ access to our platforms. It could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to our technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen occurrence, which could affect our ability to process and settle client transactions. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk, oversee operational areas involving risk, and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer unexpected losses, reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors, including those of our vendors or other third parties.While we devote substantial attention and resources to the reliability, capacity and scalability of our systems, we occasionally experience extraordinary trading volumes, which have caused and could cause our computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail, affecting our ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients’ orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate. Disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses, decreased client satisfaction, reputational damage, and regulatory inquiries. We are also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges, clearing houses, market makers, dealers, and other intermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement. System failures and constraints and transaction errors at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices and cancelled orders, cause substantial losses for us and for our clients, and subject us to claims from our clients for damages, and cause reputational harm.Certain events could increase our client service and processing times due to staffing shortages, remote work or the temporary loss of services from outsourced service providers, such as occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider service quality to be an important part of the client experience and our failure to meet client expectations could result in decreased client satisfaction.We take steps to prevent and detect fraud but the ways that fraudulent activity is attempted is continuously evolving. Although we monitor for new types of fraud, there may be a delay in recognizing the fraud is happening. Besides potential losses, shutting down fraudulent activity often requires a balance with client experience. Instances of fraud might negatively impact our reputation and client confidence in the Company, in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances.Our investment management operations may subject us to fiduciary or other legal liability for client losses.Fund and trust management and administration are complex activities and include functions such as recordkeeping and accounting, security pricing, corporate actions, compliance with investment restrictions, daily net asset value computations, account reconciliations, and required distributions to fund shareholders. Failure to properly perform operational tasks, or the misrepresentation of our services and products could subject us to regulatory sanctions, penalties or litigation and result in reputational damage, liability to clients, and the termination of investment management or administration agreements and the withdrawal of assets under our management.In the management and administration of funds and client accounts, we use quantitative models and other tools and resources to support investment decisions and processes, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, trading and hedging activities and product valuations. Errors in the design, function, or underlying assumptions used in these models and - 16 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONtools, particularly if we fail to detect the errors over an extended period, could subject us to claims of a breach of fiduciary duty and potentially large liabilities for make-whole payments, litigation, and/or regulatory fines.We rely on outsourced service providers to perform key functions.We rely on external service providers to perform certain key technology, cloud infrastructure, processing, servicing, and support functions. These service providers face technology, operating, business, and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client, employee, or company information, could cause us to incur losses and could harm our reputation. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider as a result of systems failures, capacity constraints, financial difficulties, natural disasters, extreme weather, power outage, public health crises, political developments, war, international disputes, or for any other reason, and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could disrupt our operations, impact our ability to offer certain products and services, and result in financial losses to us. We temporarily lost the services from some of our outsourced service providers during the COVID-19 pandemic which contributed to increased client service response and processing times. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we had to replace certain vendor resources which added incremental complexity in our TD Ameritrade conversion work. Switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations.We rely on financial intermediaries to execute and settle client orders. We rely on market makers, dealers, securities exchanges, clearing houses, and other financial intermediaries to execute and settle our clients’ orders. The unwillingness or inability of any of these parties to perform their usual functions coupled with the unavailability of alternative arrangements could result in our clients’ orders not getting executed or settled. This may be due to market volatility, uneconomic trading conditions, capacity constraints, financial constraints, system failures, unanticipated trading halts invoked by securities exchanges, market closures, or other reasons. Our inability to get client orders executed or settled because of the unwillingness or inability of these parties to perform their usual functions could result in client dissatisfaction and reputational harm and expose us to client claims for damages. Liquidity RiskA significant decrease in our liquidity could negatively affect our business as well as reduce client confidence in us.Maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to our business operations, including transaction settlement, custody requirements, and lending commitments, among other liquidity needs. We meet our liquidity needs primarily from working capital and cash generated by client activity as well as external financing. Fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances, as well as market conditions or changes in regulatory treatment of client deposits, may affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs. A reduction in our liquidity position could reduce client confidence in us, which could result in the transfer of client assets and accounts, or could cause us to fail to satisfy our liquidity requirements, including the LCR. In addition, if our broker-dealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines, or if a depository institution subsidiary is unable to obtain regulatory approval, when required, to declare a dividend, regulators could limit the subsidiaries’ ability to upstream funds to CSC or limit their operations, which could reduce CSC’s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt, pay dividends on CSC’s preferred stock and common stock, repurchase its shares, or redeem its preferred stock. In addition, CSC may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries.Factors which may adversely affect our liquidity position include CS&Co and TDAC having temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances, fluctuations in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts, a dramatic increase in our lending activities (including margin, mortgage-related, and personal lending), increased capital requirements, changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations, other regulatory changes, or a loss of market or client confidence in us resulting in unanticipated withdrawals of client funds. As a member firm of securities and derivatives clearing houses, we are required to deposit cash, stock and/or government securities for margin requirements and to clearing funds. The margin requirements may fluctuate significantly from time to time based upon the nature and size of clients’ trading activity and market volatility, and member firms like us have been required to deposit additional funds. Clearing houses could also require additional funds from member firms if a clearing member defaults on its obligations to the clearing house in an amount larger than its own margin and clearing fund deposits.When available cash is not sufficient for our liquidity needs, we may be required to seek external financing. During periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets, potential sources of external financing could be reduced, and borrowing costs could increase. Although CSC, CS&Co, and TDAC maintain uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines and CSC has a commercial paper issuance program, as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC which can be used to sell securities, - 17 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONfinancing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets. In addition, a significant downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets.When short-term interest rates rapidly increase, as they did in 2022, the pace at which clients move certain cash balances out of our sweep features and into higher yielding alternatives generally increases. When these outflows outpace excess cash on hand and cash generated by maturities and paydowns on our investment and loan portfolios, as they recently have, our banking subsidiaries may use temporary supplemental funding, such as advances under Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) secured credit facilities, borrowings under repurchase agreements with external financial institutions, and issuances of brokered certificates of deposit, which have higher costs. In addition, to access new FHLB advances or roll over existing advances, our banking subsidiaries must maintain positive tangible capital, as defined by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Larger unrealized losses on our available for sale (AFS) portfolio due to higher market interest rates could negatively impact our tangible capital.Credit RiskWe may suffer significant losses from our credit exposures.Our businesses are subject to the risk that a client, counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations, or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate. While we have policies and procedures designed to manage this risk, the policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Our exposure mainly results from margin lending, clients’ options and futures trading, securities lending, mortgage lending, pledged asset lending, our role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities, and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds we sponsor.When clients purchase securities on margin, borrow on lines of credit collateralized by securities, or trade options or futures, we are subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their accounts falls below the amount of clients’ indebtedness. Abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses, especially if there is a lack of liquidity. As a result of our TD Ameritrade acquisition, our margin, options and futures business has materially increased and market liquidity may represent an increased risk.We have exposure to credit risk associated with our investments. Those investments are subject to price fluctuations. Loss of value of securities can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such loss of value has resulted from a credit loss. The evaluation of whether a credit loss exists is a matter of judgment, which includes the assessment of multiple factors. If management determines that a security’s decline in fair value is the result of a credit loss, an allowance for credit losses on the security will be recorded and a corresponding loss will be recognized in current earnings. Even if a decline in fair value of a security is not determined to have resulted from a credit loss, if we were ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity needs, we would have to recognize any unrealized losses at that time. Our bank loans primarily consist of First Mortgages, HELOCs, and PALs. Increases in delinquency and default rates, housing and stock price declines, increases in the unemployment rate, and other economic factors, can result in increases in allowances for credit losses and related credit loss expense, as well as write downs on such loans.Heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments can increase our risk of loss. Examples include:•Large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry;•Mortgage loans and HELOCs to banking clients which are secured by properties in the same geographic region; and•Client margins, options or futures, pledged assets, and securities lending activities collateralized by or linked to securities of a single issuer, index, or industry.We sponsor a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds. Although we have no obligation to do so, we may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit, liquidity or other support to our funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity. Such support could cause us to take significant charges, could reduce our liquidity and, in certain situations, could, with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds, result in us having to consolidate one or more funds in our financial statements. If we choose not to provide credit, liquidity or other support in such a situation, we could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected.- 18 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONRisks Related to Our TD Ameritrade AcquisitionWe are undertaking one of the largest brokerage account conversions and could experience unanticipated issues.As part of our TD Ameritrade integration, we plan to transition the TD Ameritrade brokerage accounts to Schwab in multiple transition groups, as well as several TD Ameritrade platforms, while at the same time adding scale. Doing the conversion in multiple transition groups adds complexity, including maintaining appropriate regulatory capital and liquidity. Although we have undertaken extensive planning and testing, the account transitions are complicated and we could experience issues which cause a transition group to be delayed, or negatively impact the client experience. Such issues could impact client retention, integration-related costs, the timing for realizing synergies, our reputation, and compliance with regulatory requirements. In order to support TD Ameritrade clients through the account transitions, some of which will take place over holiday weekends, we are increasing our client service staffing. If we are not able to add and retain sufficient client service staff or retain other employees working on the account transitions, client service may be unacceptable, leading to higher than anticipated client attrition, or account transitions may not be successful.We may fail to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the TD Ameritrade acquisition, which could adversely affect the value of our stock.The success of our TD Ameritrade acquisition will continue to depend, in significant part, on our ability to realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from integrating the businesses of Schwab and TD Ameritrade which is subject to certain risks. If we are not able to successfully combine the businesses of Schwab and TD Ameritrade within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected, the combined business may not perform as expected and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key Schwab or TD Ameritrade employees, the loss of clients, the disruption of either company’s or both companies’ ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated.We will need to continue to hire a significant number of technology personnel and contract staff and rely on a number of critical technology vendors in order to complete the integration work relating to technology platforms and systems within the target timeframe. In addition, we may still experience some delays in acquiring the technology and infrastructure components needed for the integration. We have to make certain assumptions for integration planning and subsequent changes to integration plans impact the timing and cost of the integration. For example, as a result of the higher levels of trading volumes that we recently experienced, we had to increase capacity from the original technology build-out plan. Also, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we had to replace certain vendor resources which added incremental complexity in our TD Ameritrade conversion work. In addition, at times the attention of certain members of our management and other resources may be diverted from integration work to critical day-to-day business operations. We may also encounter challenges integrating TD Ameritrade technologies into Schwab platforms. Any of these factors could make timely achievement of integration milestones more challenging, particularly with regard to technology and systems. We will continue to incur significant integration costs in connection with the integration of TD Ameritrade. We will continue to incur significant non-recurring costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans with respect to combining the operations of Schwab and TD Ameritrade, including technology-related, workforce and facilities consolidation costs. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies’ businesses. We may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other employees during the integration of TD Ameritrade.Uncertainty about the effect of the TD Ameritrade integration on Schwab and TD Ameritrade employees may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the integration process, as employees of Schwab and TD Ameritrade may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined business. If employees of Schwab or TD Ameritrade depart, the integration of the companies may be more difficult and the combined business may be harmed. Furthermore, we may have to incur significant costs in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees and may lose significant expertise and talent relating to the businesses of Schwab or TD Ameritrade, and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may be adversely affected. In addition, there could be disruptions to or distractions for the workforce and management associated with integrating employees into Schwab. - 19 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONThe TD Ameritrade acquisition may not be accretive to our earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. Based on the anticipated synergies between Schwab and TD Ameritrade, we expect the acquisition to be accretive to our earnings per share in the third year following completion of the merger. However, future events and conditions could reduce or delay the accretion that is currently projected or result in the acquisition being dilutive to our earnings per share, including adverse changes in market conditions, additional transaction and integration related costs and other factors such as the failure to realize some or all of the benefits anticipated in the acquisition. Any dilution of, reduction in, or delay of any accretion to, our earnings per share could cause the price of shares of our common stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate. Other Business RisksPotential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on our financial position.We evaluate potential strategic transactions, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions. Any such transaction could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The process of evaluating, negotiating, effecting, and integrating any such strategic transaction may divert management’s attention from other business concerns, and might cause the loss of key clients, employees, and business partners. Moreover, integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties, including the need to integrate operational, financial, and management information systems and management controls, integrate relationships with clients and business partners, and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas. The integration process could result in the disruption of ongoing businesses or changes to inconsistent standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, employees, outsourced service providers and vendors. In addition, an acquisition may cause us to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings or require the amortization of a large amount of acquired intangible assets. Further, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition in a timely manner or at all (including without limitation the recent acquisition of TD Ameritrade), and any future acquisition could be dilutive to our current stockholders’ percentage ownership or to earnings per common share (EPS).Our acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in the business, operations or financial condition of the entity or part of an entity being acquired or sold. To the extent we enter into an agreement to buy or sell an entity or part of an entity, there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected, or at all. If a material transaction does not close, our stock price could decline.Our industry is highly competitive and characterized by aggressive price competition.We operate in a highly competitive environment with a broad array of competitors from large integrated banks to venture-capital backed private companies. We continually monitor our pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjust interest rates on deposits and loans, fees for advisory services, expense ratios on mutual funds and ETFs, trade commission rates, and other pricing and incentives to sustain our competitive position. Increased price competition from other financial services firms to attract clients, such as reduced commissions, higher deposit rates, reduced mutual fund or ETF expense ratios, or the increased use of incentives, could impact our results of operations and financial condition.We face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees.The market for qualified personnel in our business is highly competitive. At various times, different functions and roles are in especially high demand in the market, compelling us to pay more to attract talent. Our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs.We need to continue to hire a significant number of technology personnel and contract staff to complete the TD Ameritrade integration work within the target timeframe. Demand for skilled technology professionals is high and we may experience delays in hiring the appropriate skilled resources.- 20 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONOur stock price has fluctuated historically, and may continue to fluctuate.Our stock price can be volatile. Among the factors that may affect the volatility of our stock price are the following:•Speculation in the investment community or the press about, or actual changes in, our competitive position, organizational structure, executive team, operations, financial condition, financial reporting and results, expense discipline, strategic transactions, progress on achieving the expected benefits from our TD Ameritrade acquisition, or ratings from third parties;•The announcement of new products, services, acquisitions, or dispositions by us or our competitors; •Increases or decreases in revenue or earnings, changes in earnings estimates by the investment community, and variations between estimated financial results and actual financial results; and•Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by large stockholders.Changes in the stock market generally, or as it concerns our industry, as well as geopolitical, corporate, regulatory, business, and economic factors may also affect our stock price.Future sales of CSC’s equity securities may adversely affect the market price of CSC’s common stock and result in dilution.CSC’s certificate of incorporation authorizes CSC’s Board of Directors, among other things, to issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities, without stockholder approval. CSC may issue additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital or for other purposes. The issuance of any additional equity or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of CSC’s common stock and may adversely affect the market price of CSC’s common stock.Our ongoing relationships with TD Bank and its affiliates could have a negative impact on us. Although our acquisition of TD Ameritrade was structured such that completion of the merger would not result in CSC either (i) being deemed to be “controlled” by TD Bank (as that term is interpreted by the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act or HOLA) or (ii) being deemed to be in “control” of any of TD Bank’s depository institutions, changes in circumstances could trigger presumptions of control under the Federal Reserve’s regulations. This could occur if TD Bank and its affiliates own more than 9.9% of Schwab common stock, as interpreted in accordance with the applicable rules of the Federal Reserve. While the Stockholder Agreement between CSC and TD Bank prohibits TD Bank and its affiliates from exceeding the 9.9% threshold, it could happen unintentionally. This presumption of control could also be triggered if the revenue generated to either us or to any of the TD Bank depository institutions exceeds a certain percentage. The Stockholder Agreement contains provisions to address such situations.Under the IDA agreement, we are only permitted to reduce the deposit balances swept to the TD Depository Institutions by a set amount during each 12-month period, subject to certain limitations and adjustments including maintaining a minimum $50 billion IDA sweep balance through June 2031. The bank deposit account fee revenue that we earn related to the IDA agreement may be less than the net interest revenue that we could have earned if the deposit balances were swept to our banking subsidiaries rather than the TD Depository Institutions. When we are permitted to reduce the IDA balances, we can only move the balances to our banking subsidiaries if we have sufficient capital. In addition, in a low rate environment it is possible that the sweep arrangement fee computation could result in a negative amount that we would be required to pay the TD Depository Institutions, resulting in us having an expense rather than revenue.

We believe that metrics relating to net new and total client assets, as well as client cash levels and utilization of advisory services, offer perspective on our business momentum and client engagement. Data on new and total client brokerage accounts provides additional perspective on our ability to attract and retain new business. Total net revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin, EPS, return on average common stockholders’ equity, and the Consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio provide broad indicators of Schwab’s overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns. Total expenses excluding interest as a percentage of average client assets is a measure of operating efficiency. Our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations and financial condition of TD Ameritrade beginning on October 6, 2020, as discussed below. Results for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 are as follows:Growth Rate 1-Year 2021-2022202220212020Client MetricsNet new client assets (in billions) (1)(21)%$406.9 $516.2 $1,952.5 Core net new client assets (in billions)(23)%$427.7 $558.2 $281.9 Client assets (in billions, at year end)(13)%$7,049.8 $8,138.0 $6,691.7 Average client assets (in billions)(3)%$7,292.8 $7,493.8 $4,579.0 New brokerage accounts (in thousands) (2)(45)%4,044 7,306 18,627 Active brokerage accounts (in thousands, at year end)2%33,758 33,165 29,629 Assets receiving ongoing advisory services (in billions, at year end)(10)%$3,673.2 $4,064.4 $3,300.1 Client cash as a percentage of client assets (at year end)12.3 %10.9 %12.3 %Company Financial Information and MetricsTotal net revenues12%$20,762 $18,520 $11,691 Total expenses excluding interest5%11,374 10,807 7,391 Income before taxes on income22%9,388 7,713 4,300 Taxes on income19%2,205 1,858 1,001 Net income23%$7,183 $5,855 $3,299 Preferred stock dividends and other11%548 495 256 Net income available to common stockholders24%$6,635 $5,360 $3,043 Earnings per common share — diluted24%$3.50 $2.83 $2.12 Net revenue growth from prior year12 %58 %9 %Pre-tax profit margin45.2 %41.6 %36.8 %Return on average common stockholders’ equity18 %11 %9 %Expenses excluding interest as a percentage of average client assets0.16 %0.14 %0.16 %Consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio (at year end)7.2 %6.2 %6.3 %Non-GAAP Financial Measures (3)Adjusted total expenses (4)$10,386 $9,724 $6,759 Adjusted diluted EPS$3.90 $3.25 $2.45 Return on tangible common equity42 %22 %15 %(1) 2022 includes outflows of $20.8 billion from certain mutual fund clearing services clients. 2021 includes outflows of $42.0 billion from certain mutual fund clearing services clients. 2020 includes inflows of $1.6 trillion related to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade, $79.9 billion related to the acquisition of the assets of USAA-IMCO, $8.5 billion related to the acquisition of Wasmer Schroeder, and $10.9 billion from a mutual fund clearing services client.(2) 2020 includes 14.5 million new brokerage accounts related to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and 1.1 million new brokerage accounts related to the acquisition of assets from USAA-IMCO.(3) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results.(4) Adjusted total expenses is a non-GAAP financial measure adjusting total expenses excluding interest. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures.- 30 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)2022 Compared to 2021Schwab’s 2022 financial results reflected strong performance against a challenging economic backdrop. Our clients faced a very difficult environment throughout the year, encountering inflation and global economic concerns, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine exacerbating the impact. Equity markets suffered their worst year since 2008, with the S&P 500® and NASDAQ Composite® contracting 19% and 33%, respectively, in 2022, while investor sentiment remained bearish throughout the year. At the same time, the Federal Reserve raised short-term rates at the fastest pace in 40 years, ultimately increasing the Fed Funds rate seven times to reach an upper bound of 4.50% in December. Additionally, uncertainty around future macroeconomic growth increased in the second half of the year, weighing on longer-term rates and leading to an inverted yield curve.Through these challenges, clients continued to turn to Schwab for help in achieving their financial goals. Core net new assets in 2022 totaled $427.7 billion, representing an organic growth rate of 5%, which included significant tax-related outflows in April. Total client assets were $7.05 trillion at December 31, 2022, down 13% from year-end 2021, as market value declines of approximately $1.5 trillion in client assets more than offset the Company’s continued asset gathering during the year. DATs in 2022 were 5.9 million, down 9% from the prior year, as trading volume subsided from the extraordinary levels seen in 2021. New brokerage accounts were also down from the prior year, as clients opened 4.0 million new brokerage accounts in 2022; active brokerage accounts totaled 33.8 million at December 31, 2022, up 2% from year-end 2021. Schwab’s financial performance in 2022 reflected the resiliency of our diversified financial model in a challenging macroeconomic environment and impacts from higher market interest rates. Net income totaled $7.2 billion in 2022 and diluted EPS was $3.50, representing year-over-year growth of 23% and 24%, respectively. Adjusted diluted EPS (1), which excludes acquisition and integration-related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and related income tax effects, was $3.90 in 2022, up from $3.25 in 2021. Total net revenues rose 12% year-over-year to $20.8 billion in 2022. Net interest revenue increased to $10.7 billion, rising 33% from 2021 as significantly higher market rates more than offset the impact of balance sheet contraction due to client cash allocation decisions. Asset management and administration fees totaled $4.2 billion in 2022, down 1% year-over-year as lower market valuations throughout the year offset the benefit of lower money market fund fee waivers. Trading revenue declined by 12% to $3.7 billion in 2022, due to lower DATs relative to the extraordinary trading volume seen in 2021 and changes in mix of client trading activity. Bank deposit account fee revenue was $1.4 billion in 2022, up 7% from 2021 as higher average net yields more than offset lower average BDA balances. BDA balances totaled $126.6 billion at December 31, 2022, down 20% from year-end 2021, reflecting client cash allocation decisions and migrations to our balance sheet.Total expenses excluding interest amounted to $11.4 billion in 2022, increasing 5% from 2021, and adjusted total expenses (1) were $10.4 billion, up 7% from the prior year. These increases reflected higher compensation and benefits expense and higher occupancy and equipment expense, as we continued to invest in our people and technology to support ongoing growth in our client base. These increases were partially offset by lower other expense, which included a charge of approximately $200 million in 2021 (see Item 8 – Note 15). Acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangibles were $392 million and $596 million, respectively, in 2022, compared with $468 million and $615 million, respectively, in 2021.Return on average common stockholders’ equity grew to 18% in 2022 from 11% in 2021, while return on tangible common equity (1) (ROTCE) increased to 42% in 2022 compared with 22% in 2021. The increases in both return on average common stockholders’ equity and ROTCE were due primarily to lower stockholders’ equity and growth in net income. Stockholders’ equity declined in 2022 primarily due to a significant decrease in AOCI, as higher market interest rates resulted in larger unrealized losses on our AFS investment securities portfolio. In January and November 2022, the Company transferred $108.8 billion and $79.8 billion, respectively, of investment securities from the AFS category to the held to maturity (HTM) category (see Capital Management and Item 8 – Note 6). The Company continued its diligent approach to balance sheet management in 2022, maintaining appropriate capital and liquidity to support client activity and returning excess capital to stockholders. As market rates rose from near-zero levels at the beginning of the year, clients allocated a growing portion of their assets to higher yielding cash and fixed income alternatives. Total balance sheet assets decreased 17% year-over-year to $551.8 billion at December 31, 2022 as a result of these client cash allocation decisions and unrealized losses on AFS securities, both resulting primarily from higher market interest rates. To facilitate these client cash movements, we took steps to enhance our liquidity by limiting new portfolio investments to help build available cash and utilizing short-term funding sources including FHLB advances and retail certificates of deposit. (1) Adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted total expenses, and return on tangible common equity are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results.- 31 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)We increased our common stock dividend by 22% during 2022, and implemented a $15 billion share repurchase authorization in July. Repurchases under this new authorization totaled 47 million shares for $3.4 billion in 2022. The Company issued $750 million in preferred stock in the first quarter of 2022, and redeemed a total of $1.0 billion of preferred stock during the second half of the year. Inclusive of these actions, the Company’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio finished the year at 7.2%, above our operating objective of 6.50%-6.75%. 2021 Compared to 2020 Schwab delivered strong growth and financial performance in 2021, consistently executing on our “Through Clients’ Eyes” strategy throughout a fluctuating macroeconomic environment. Early in 2021 we saw strengthened investor optimism, fueled by an advancing economic recovery and signs of improvement in the COVID-19 pandemic. As the year progressed, debates increased over the pace of economic growth, the path of inflation, and the ultimate impact of multiple global market disruptions. After major equity indices rose throughout the first half of 2021, they were essentially flat during the summer months before ending the year at near-record levels. While short-term interest rates remained near zero throughout 2021, longer-term rates began to rise initially, then eased and rose again as the 10-year Treasury yield finally ended 2021 at 1.52%, up 59 basis points from year-end 2020.Investors were actively engaged with the markets throughout 2021, including extraordinary trading volume in the first quarter, and client activity throughout the remainder of the year also generally exceeded the fourth quarter of 2020 when we included TD Ameritrade in our results for the first time. Asset gathering was strong throughout 2021, as core net new assets totaled $558.2 billion, representing an 8% annual organic growth rate from year-end 2020. We ended 2021 with $8.14 trillion in client assets and 33.2 million brokerage accounts, representing increases of 22% and 12%, respectively, from December 31, 2020. Even as we worked to support heightened levels of client activity during 2021, the Company continued to drive progress across our key strategic priorities of scale and efficiency, win-win monetization, and segmentation. We also made significant progress in 2021 on our integration of TD Ameritrade.Schwab produced strong financial performance during 2021, reflecting consistent execution of our strategy, strong client engagement, and a generally supportive macroeconomic backdrop. Net income totaled $5.9 billion during 2021, increasing 77% from 2020, while diluted EPS amounted to $2.83, increasing 33% from the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS (1) amounted to $3.25, increasing 33% from 2020. Comparisons of our financial results in 2021 with those of 2020 were significantly impacted by the first full-year inclusion of TD Ameritrade in 2021.Total net revenues increased 58% from 2020 to reach $18.5 billion in 2021, supported by growth across all of our major revenue streams. Net interest revenue totaled $8.0 billion in 2021, increasing 31% from 2020 primarily due to the inclusion of TD Ameritrade as well as significant growth in interest-earning assets, including rising investment portfolio balances and increased utilization of our range of lending products, partially offset by lower average yields. Asset management and administration fees grew 23% over the prior year to reach $4.3 billion due to the inclusion of TD Ameritrade as well as rising balances in advice solutions and both proprietary and third-party mutual funds and ETFs, partially offset by lower revenue on money market funds.Trading revenue was $4.2 billion in 2021, nearly three times the prior year total of $1.4 billion, as the full-year inclusion of TD Ameritrade and the overall strong trading environment drove a significant increase in DATs. Trading revenue was also helped in 2021 by a higher proportion of derivatives trades, which contributed to higher revenue per trade. A full year of bank deposit account fees totaled $1.3 billion in 2021. BDA balances totaled $158.6 billion at December 31, 2021, down 3% from the year-end 2020 balance of $163.5 billion, reflecting migrations to Schwab’s balance sheet during 2021.Total expenses excluding interest were $10.8 billion in 2021, increasing 46% from 2020 due to the full-year inclusion of TD Ameritrade’s results as well as higher compensation and benefits expense, which was driven by additional headcount to support our expanding client base and a higher bonus accrual, as well as merit increases and a 5% employee salary increase we implemented at the end of the third quarter of 2021. During 2021, acquisition and integration-related costs were $468 million, increasing from $442 million in 2020, and amortization of acquired intangible assets totaled $615 million, rising from $190 million in 2020. Exclusive of these items, adjusted total expenses (1) were $9.7 billion in 2021, increasing 44% from 2020.Return on average common stockholders’ equity was 11% in 2021, growing from 9% in 2020, and ROTCE (1) was 22% in 2021, up from 15% in 2020. The increases in both return on average common stockholders’ equity and ROTCE were primarily a result of significantly higher net income in 2021. (1) Adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted total expenses, and return on tangible common equity are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results.- 32 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)The Company continued its consistent approach to balance sheet management in 2021, supporting overall growth and liquidity. Total balance sheet assets rose to $667.3 billion at December 31, 2021, increasing 22% from year-end 2020, driven primarily by client asset flows, as well as $10.6 billion in BDA balance migrations. We also added a net $10.2 billion to outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt for liquidity management purposes, and increased preferred stock by a net $2.3 billion to help support continued business growth. The Company’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 6.2% at year-end 2021.Though significantly heightened client activity levels during the first quarter of 2021 impacted our service quality at times, we took multiple actions to better deliver the service experience our clients deserve and rely on, including enhancing online self-service capabilities, streamlining our call-routing processes, and increasing hiring. Our efforts began yielding results early in 2021, with significant improvement in client service levels by the end of the first quarter of 2021, and our service levels continued to be improved throughout the remainder of 2021 as client activity moderated.Business and Asset AcquisitionsTD Ameritrade Effective October 6, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade. TD Ameritrade provides securities brokerage services, including trade execution, clearing services, and margin lending; and futures and foreign exchange trade execution services. The Company revalued and recorded TD Ameritrade’s assets and liabilities at their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition. The Company expects to continue to incur significant acquisition and integration-related costs and integration-related capital expenditures throughout the remaining integration process. Such costs have included, and are expected to continue to include, professional fees, such as legal, advisory, and accounting fees, compensation and benefits expenses for employees and contractors involved in the integration work, and costs for technology enhancements. The Company has also incurred exit and other related costs to attain anticipated synergies, which are primarily comprised of employee compensation and benefits such as severance pay, other termination benefits, and retention costs, as well as costs related to facility closures such as accelerated amortization and depreciation or impairments of assets in those locations. As a result of the significant growth seen beginning in late 2020 and early 2021 across key client volume metrics, including the number of active brokerage accounts, DATs, and peak daily trades, the Company determined in 2021 to increase the scope of technology work related to the integration, and commenced greater technology build-out to support the expanded volumes of our combined client base. Based on our current integration plans, the Company expects to complete most client transitions from TD Ameritrade to Schwab across multiple groups over the course of 2023, with the transition of a small client group in the first half of 2024. The first transition of client accounts was completed in February 2023. We expect to incur total acquisition and integration-related costs and capital expenditures of between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, which reflects increased costs resulting from incremental complexity in transition work, due in part to the replacement of certain vendor resources following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as well as overall inflationary pressures. The Company’s estimates of the nature, amounts, and timing of recognition of acquisition and integration-related costs remain subject to change based on a number of factors, including the expected duration and complexity of the integration process and the continued uncertainty of the economic environment. More specifically, factors that could cause variability in our expected acquisition and integration-related costs include the level of employee attrition and availability of third-party labor, workforce redeployment from eliminated positions into open roles, changes in the levels of client activity, as well as changes in the scope and cost of technology and real estate-related exit cost variability due to the effects of changes in remote working trends.Acquisition and integration-related costs, which are inclusive of related exit costs, totaled $392 million, $468 million, and $442 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and the Company expects to incur acquisition and integration-related costs of approximately $450-$550 million in 2023. Over the course of the integration, we continue to expect to realize annualized cost synergies of between $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion, and, through December 31, 2022, we have achieved over 65% of this amount on an annualized run-rate basis. The Company expects to achieve the vast majority of the remaining estimated cost synergies by the end of 2024, with anticipated full year synergy realization beginning in 2025. Estimated timing and amounts of synergy realization are subject to change as we progress in the integration.

The four proposed rules are described below. •The “Order Competition Rule” would require that, before most individual investors’ orders could be executed internally by a trading center (like wholesaler market makers), those orders must first be exposed to a qualifying order-by-order auction in which both market makers and institutional investors can participate.•“Regulation Best Execution” would establish an SEC-level best execution standard (in addition to the existing FINRA and MSRB best execution rules) for broker-dealers and require them to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures addressing how the broker-dealer will comply with the best execution standard and make routing or execution decisions for customer orders. Regulation Best Execution would apply not only to equities, but to all securities.•Amendments to Rule 605 of Regulation NMS requiring enhanced disclosures of order execution quality for large brokers that handle retail orders.•A rule to (i) amend minimum pricing increments (or tick sizes) that would apply to both the quoting and trading of NMS stocks, (ii) reduce the exchange access fee caps, and (iii) require transparency of odd-lots.The comment periods for the proposed rules end on March 31, 2023 and the impact to Schwab cannot be assessed until the final rules are released.In November 2022, the SEC proposed a rule that would require substantial changes to the liquidity risk management programs for open-end mutual funds other than money market funds (funds) and require them to implement “swing pricing” and impose a “hard close” on the acceptance of purchase and redemption orders. Swing pricing would require funds to adjust the fund’s current net asset value (NAV) per share by a “swing factor” if the fund has either (i) net redemptions (no threshold) or (ii) net purchases that exceed a specified threshold (2% of the fund’s net assets). To implement the swing pricing requirements, the proposed rule also would require that a fund, its transfer agent, or a registered clearing agency receive purchase and redemption orders prior to the time the fund has established for determining the NAV, typically market close, in order to receive a given day’s NAV (a “hard close”). Current practices permit fund orders received by a financial intermediary prior to the fund cut-off time to be transmitted to the fund after the fund cut-off time and for the order to receive that day’s NAV. Under the proposed rule, orders received by the fund, its transfer agent or registered clearing agency after the fund cut-off time would receive the next day’s NAV. The comment period for the proposed rule ended on February 14, 2023 and the impact to Schwab cannot be assessed until the final rule is released.In May 2022, the federal banking agencies issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking that would substantially revise how an insured depository institution’s CRA performance is evaluated. The proposed rule includes revisions relating to the delineation of assessment areas, the overall evaluation framework and performance standards and metrics, the definition of community development activities and data collection and reporting. The comment period for the proposed rule ended on August 5, 2022 and the impact to Schwab cannot be assessed until the final rule is released.- 34 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)RESULTS OF OPERATIONSTotal Net RevenuesTotal net revenues of $20.8 billion and $18.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, represented growth of 12% and 58% from the prior periods.

Percentage changes greater than 200% are presented as not meaningful.Net Interest RevenueSchwab’s primary interest-earning assets include cash and cash equivalents; cash and investments segregated; margin loans, which constitute the majority of receivables from brokerage clients; investment securities; and bank loans. Fees earned and expenses incurred on securities lending and borrowing activities are conducted by our broker-dealer subsidiaries using assets held in client brokerage accounts. Schwab’s interest-bearing liabilities are comprised of bank deposits, which include brokered certificates of deposit beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022; payables to brokerage clients; short-term borrowings (e.g., FHLB advances, commercial paper, secured borrowings by our broker-dealer subsidiaries, or repurchase agreements); and long-term debt. Schwab deploys the funds from these sources into the assets outlined above. As Schwab builds its client base, we attract new client sweep cash, which is a primary driver of funding balance sheet growth. We do not use short-term, wholesale borrowings to support our long-term investment activity, but may use such funding for short-term liquidity purposes or to provide temporary funding. Non-interest-bearing funding sources include stockholders’ equity, certain client cash balances, and other miscellaneous liabilities. The Company’s investment strategy is designed to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise while attempting to moderate the decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall. In order to keep interest-rate sensitivity within established limits, management actively monitors and adjusts interest-rate sensitivity through changes in the balance sheet, primarily by adjusting the composition of our banking subsidiaries’ investment portfolios.Revenue on interest-earning assets is affected by various factors, such as the composition of assets, prevailing interest rates and spreads at the time of origination or purchase, changes in interest rates on floating-rate securities and loans, and changes in prepayment levels for mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and loans. Schwab establishes the rates paid on client-- 35 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)related liabilities, and management expects that it will generally adjust the rates paid on these liabilities at some fraction of any movement in short-term rates. Interest expense on long-term debt, short-term borrowings, and other funding sources is impacted by market interest rates at the time of borrowing and changes in interest rates on floating-rate liabilities. See also Risk Management – Interest Rate Risk Simulations.Interest rates increased significantly from year-end 2021 through year-end 2022. Short-term rates were near zero until the Federal Reserve began its aggressive tightening cycle in March 2022 in response to rising inflation, ultimately increasing the federal funds target overnight rate seven times between March and December for a total increase of 425 basis points. Long-term interest rates increased throughout 2022, though at a less rapid pace, leading to an inverted yield curve.Schwab continued to see strength in net new client assets during 2022, which, along with transfers of BDA balances to the Company’s balance sheet (see Bank Deposit Account Fees), drove growth in Schwab’s average interest-earning assets in 2022 relative to 2021. Partially offsetting this growth, we experienced significant seasonal tax outflows in the second quarter, and, due to the rapid increases to the federal funds overnight rate, changes in client cash allocations increased in the second half of 2022 which resulted in a total decrease in bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients of 18% since year-end 2021. During 2022, the Company increased its cash holdings and reduced the duration of incremental investment securities purchases, which has provided flexibility to support such changes in client cash allocations associated with higher short-term interest rates. During 2021, interest rates remained historically low. Short-term rates remained near zero throughout 2021; longer-term interest rates began to rise early in the year, then remained largely unchanged before rising again in the fourth quarter. Elevated levels of prepayments on mortgage-backed securities persisted throughout the continued low interest rate environment in 2021 and resulted in accelerated reinvestment of the AFS portfolio; purchases of AFS securities totaled $171.7 billion in 2021. Schwab saw consistent strength in new client brokerage accounts and net new client assets throughout 2021, driving growth in Schwab’s interest-earning assets. At the same time, client engagement in the equity markets increased and clients were net buyers of equity securities and other investment products, resulting in outflows of client cash and partially offsetting the growth in interest-earning assets in 2021 relative to 2020.- 36 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)The following table presents net interest revenue information corresponding to interest-earning assets and funding sources on the consolidated balance sheets:Year Ended December 31,202220212020AverageBalanceInterestRevenue/ExpenseAverage Yield/RateAverageBalanceInterest Revenue/ExpenseAverage Yield/RateAverageBalanceInterest Revenue/ExpenseAverage Yield/RateInterest-earning assetsCash and cash equivalents$57,163 $812 1.40 %$40,325 $40 0.10 %$39,052 $120 0.30 %Cash and investments segregated49,430 691 1.38 %43,942 24 0.05 %34,100 141 0.41 %Receivables from brokerage clients75,614 3,321 4.33 %77,768 2,455 3.11 %28,058 848 2.97 %Available for sale securities (1,2)260,392 4,139 1.58 %357,122 4,641 1.30 %253,555 4,537 1.78 %Held to maturity securities (1,2)112,357 1,688 1.50 %— — — — — — Bank loans38,816 1,083 2.79 %28,789 620 2.15 %20,932 545 2.60 %Total interest-earning assets593,772 11,734 1.96 %547,946 7,780 1.41 %375,697 6,191 1.64 %Securities lending revenue471 720 334 Other interest revenue22 6 6 Total interest-earning assets$593,772 $12,227 2.04 %$547,946 $8,506 1.54 %$375,697 $6,531 1.73 %Funding sourcesBank deposits$424,168 $723 0.17 %$381,549 $54 0.01 %$291,206 $93 0.03 %Payables to brokerage clients97,825 123 0.13 %91,667 9 0.01 %46,347 12 0.02 %Short-term borrowings (3)4,993 154 3.07 %3,040 9 0.30 %89 — 0.20 %Long-term debt20,714 498 2.40 %17,704 384 2.17 %8,992 289 3.22 %Total interest-bearing liabilities547,700 1,498 0.27 %493,960 456 0.09 %346,634 394 0.11 %Non-interest-bearing funding sources46,072 53,986 29,063 Securities lending expense48 24 33 Other interest expense(1)(4)(9)Total funding sources$593,772 $1,545 0.26 %$547,946 $476 0.09 %$375,697 $418 0.11 %Net interest revenue$10,682 1.78 %$8,030 1.45 %$6,113 1.62 %(1) Amounts have been calculated based on amortized cost. Interest revenue on investment securities is presented net of related premium amortization.(2) In January 2022 and November 2022, the Company transferred a portion of its investment securities designated as AFS to the HTM category, as described in Item 8 – Note 6. (3) Interest revenue or expense was less than $500 thousand in the period or periods presented.Net interest revenue increased $2.7 billion or 33%, in 2022 from 2021 primarily due to higher average yields on interest-earning assets as a result of higher market interest rates. Net premium amortization of investment securities decreased to $1.4 billion from $2.3 billion in 2021. These benefits were partially offset by higher rates paid on funding sources, higher average short-term borrowings and long-term debt outstanding, and lower balances of margin loans and lower securities lending revenue due to decreased market demand. Average interest-earning assets for 2022 were higher by 8%, compared to 2021. This increase was primarily due to higher average balances of bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients, which resulted from net new client asset inflows as well as transfers of BDA balances to our balance sheet during 2022. These year-over-year increases in average balances were offset by client cash allocation decisions in response to higher short-term market interest rates during 2022, as clients moved certain cash balances out of bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients. Net interest margin increased to 1.78% in 2022, from 1.45% in 2021. Higher market interest rates improved yields on interest-earning assets, which more than offset the higher rates paid across interest-bearing funding sources.Net interest revenue increased $1.9 billion, or 31%, in 2021 from 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of TD Ameritrade as well as significant growth in overall interest-earning assets, including higher investment portfolio balances and margin lending, as well as growth in securities lending revenue and bank loans, partially offset by lower average yields. Accelerated premium amortization stemming from elevated prepayments of mortgage-related debt securities in the AFS portfolio continued in 2021 and partially offset the growth in net interest revenue. Net premium amortization of investment securities totaled $2.3 billion in - 37 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)2021 and $1.6 billion in 2020. TD Ameritrade contributed total net interest revenue of $1.9 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021 and $443 million in 2020 from October 6, through December 31, 2020.Average interest-earning assets for 2021 were higher by 46%, compared to 2020. This increase was largely due to higher bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients, which resulted from strong net new client asset inflows, continued heightened client cash allocations driven by the low interest rate environment in 2021, BDA balance migrations, and the inclusion of TD Ameritrade for all of 2021.Our net interest margin declined to 1.45% in 2021, from 1.62% in 2020. This decrease was driven primarily by lower overall yields received on interest-earning assets, in part due to purchases of investment securities in 2020 and 2021 at rates below the average yield on the AFS portfolio. This more than offset the benefit of increased securities lending revenue and higher margin utilization in 2021, which comprised 39% of net interest revenue during 2021, growing from 19% of net interest revenue in 2020.Asset Management and Administration FeesAsset management and administration fees include mutual fund, ETF, and CTF service fees and fees for other asset-based financial services provided to individual and institutional clients. Schwab earns mutual fund, ETF, and CTF service fees for shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. Asset management and administration fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in these funds and do not include securities lending revenues earned by proprietary mutual funds, ETFs, and CTFs, as those amounts, net of program fees, are credited to the fund shareholders. Proprietary CTFs may, but generally do not, directly participate in securities lending. The fair values of client assets included in proprietary and third-party mutual funds, ETFs, and CTFs are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data.We also earn asset management fees for advice solutions, which include managed portfolios, specialized strategies, and customized investment advice. Other asset management and administration fees include various asset-based fees such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, mutual fund clearing fees, and non-balance based service and transaction fees. Asset management and administration fees vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity. - 38 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)The following table presents asset management and administration fees, average client assets, and average fee yields:Year Ended December 31,202220212020AverageClientAssetsRevenueAverageFeeAverageClientAssetsRevenueAverageFeeAverageClientAssetsRevenueAverageFeeSchwab money market funds before fee waivers$179,791 $499 0.28 %$155,821 $457 0.29 %$200,119 $605 0.30 %Fee waivers(57)(326)(127)Schwab money market funds179,791 442 0.25 %155,821 131 0.08 %200,119 478 0.24 %Schwab equity and bond funds, ETFs, and CTFs433,005 364 0.08 %423,999 380 0.09 %301,598 300 0.10 %Mutual Fund OneSource® and other no-transaction-fee funds (1)202,015 602 0.30 %229,342 724 0.32 %192,464 599 0.31 %Other third-party mutual funds and ETFs (1,2)768,871 647 0.08 %898,248 726 0.08 %525,379 393 0.07 %Total mutual funds, ETFs, and CTFs (3)$1,583,682 2,055 0.13 %$1,707,410 1,961 0.11 %$1,219,560 1,770 0.15 %Advice solutions (3)Fee-based$441,336 1,854 0.42 %$452,503 1,993 0.44 %$306,010 1,443 0.47 %Non-fee-based89,525 — — 89,911 — — 73,161 — — Total advice solutions$530,861 1,854 0.35 %$542,414 1,993 0.37 %$379,171 1,443 0.38 %Other balance-based fees (4)561,416 244 0.04 %614,787 259 0.04 %451,350 208 0.05 %Other (5)63 61 54 Total asset management and administration fees$4,216 $4,274 $3,475 (1) In 2022, includes transfers from other third-party mutual funds and ETFs to Mutual Fund OneSource® and other NTF funds.(2) Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, includes third-party money funds related to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade.(3) Average client assets for advice solutions may also include the asset balances contained in the mutual fund and/or ETF categories listed above.(4) Includes various asset-related fees, such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, and mutual fund clearing fees and other service fees.(5) Includes miscellaneous service and transaction fees relating to mutual funds and ETFs that are not balance-based.Asset management and administration fees declined by $58 million, or 1%, in 2022 from 2021, due to lower balances in Mutual Fund OneSource® and other third-party mutual funds, as well as advice solutions, relative to 2021. Balances declined primarily due to equity market weakness during 2022, which negatively impacted client asset valuations. These decreases offset the benefit of lower money market fund fee waivers, which were eliminated during the second quarter of 2022 as a result of the Federal Reserve’s increases to the federal funds target overnight rate.Asset management and administration fees increased by $799 million, or 23%, in 2021 from 2020, due to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade, as well as additional growth in advice solutions and proprietary and third-party mutual funds and ETFs, which were due in part to strength in net new client assets and equity markets in 2021. These increases were partially offset by the effect of money market fund fee waivers due to lower portfolio yields as well as lower money market fund balances. Asset management and administration fees attributable to TD Ameritrade were $598 million in 2021 and $131 million from October 6, through December 31, 2020.The following table presents a roll forward of client assets for the Schwab money market funds, Schwab equity and bond funds, ETFs, and CTFs, and Mutual Fund OneSource® and other NTF funds.

Commission revenue is affected by volume and mix of trades executed. Order flow revenue is comprised of payments received from trade execution venues to which our broker-dealer subsidiaries send equity and option orders. Order flow revenue is affected by volume and mix of client trades, as well as pricing received from trade execution venues. Principal transaction revenue is recognized primarily as a result of accommodating clients’ fixed income trading activity, and includes adjustments to the fair value of securities positions held to facilitate such client trading activity. Principal transaction revenue also includes unrealized gains and losses on cash and investments segregated for regulatory purposes.The following tables present trading revenue, trade details, and related information:Year Ended December 31,Growth Rate2021-2022202220212020Commissions(13)%$1,787 $2,050 $739 Order flow revenueOptions(11)%1,170 1,320 360 Equities(23)%568 733 261 Total order flow revenue(15)%1,738 2,053 621 Principal transactionsN/M148 49 56 Total trading revenue(12)%$3,673 $4,152 $1,416 N/M Not meaningful.

These factors drove lower commissions and order flow revenue in 2022 relative to 2021. Partially offsetting these decreases, principal transactions revenue increased as a result of higher volume in clients’ fixed income trading and higher market interest rates.Trading revenue increased $2.7 billion, or 193%, in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and heightened client engagement, which drove significantly higher DATs throughout 2021. This increased trading activity and a higher percentage of derivatives trades drove significant growth in commissions and order flow revenue. Overall, TD Ameritrade contributed $3.3 billion of trading revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with $667 million of trading revenue from October 6, 2020 through December 31, 2020.Bank Deposit Account FeesThe Company earns bank deposit account fee revenue pursuant to the IDA agreement with the TD Depository Institutions and arrangements with other third-party banks. Bank deposit account fees are primarily affected by average BDA balances and the fixed- and floating-rate reference yields. Fees earned under the IDA agreement are affected by changes in interest rates and the composition of balances designated as fixed- and floating-rate. - 40 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)The following table presents bank deposit account fee revenue, average BDA balances, average net yield, and average balances earning fixed- and floating-rate yields:Year EndedDecember 31,Percent Change20222021Bank deposit account fees$1,409 $1,315 7 %Average BDA balances$147,273 $158,434 (7)%Average net yield0.96 %0.83 %Percentage of average BDA balances designated as:Fixed-rate balances79 %79 %Floating-rate balances21 %21 %In connection with our acquisition of TD Ameritrade, the Company began earning bank deposit account fee revenue beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020. Bank deposit account fees totaled $355 million from October 6, 2020 through December 31, 2020. During the same period, the total average BDA balance was $161.3 billion, of which 79% was designated as fixed-rate obligation amounts and 21% as floating-rate obligation amounts.Bank deposit account fees increased $94 million, or 7%, in 2022 compared to 2021. This was primarily due to higher market interest rates, which helped to increase the average net yield in 2022. The Company transferred net amounts of $21.0 billion and $10.6 billion of BDA balances to its balance sheet from the TD Depository Institutions and other third-party banks during 2022 and 2021, respectively. The transfer of these balances to our balance sheet, as well as client cash allocation decisions in response to higher short-term market interest rates in 2022, led to the decrease in average BDA balances in 2022 compared to 2021. The percentages of BDA balances designated as fixed-rate and floating-rate obligations as of December 31, 2022 were 87% and 13%, respectively.Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company ended its arrangements with the other third-party banks to simplify bank sweep operations ahead of the first TD Ameritrade client transition group in February 2023. As a result of ending these arrangements, the Company incurred breakage fees of $97 million in January 2023, recognized as a reduction to bank deposit account fee revenue. The BDA balances previously held at these other third-party banks were moved to the TD Depository Institutions. In addition, the FDIC implemented a 2-basis-point increase to the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate, which became effective for the first quarterly assessment period in 2023. This increase in the FDIC’s deposit insurance assessment will result in a decrease to bank deposit account fees revenue in 2023, which will be dependent on BDA balance levels. See Item 1 – Regulation for additional information.Transfers of BDA balances to Schwab’s balance sheet result in lower balances upon which bank deposit account fee revenue is earned but provide a source of funding to invest in interest-earning assets to increase net interest revenue. See also Capital Management and Item 8 – Note 15 for discussion of the IDA agreement and the potential to move IDA balances to Schwab’s balance sheet. Other RevenueOther revenue includes exchange processing fees, certain service fees, other gains and losses from the sale of assets, and the provision for credit losses on bank loans.Other revenue increased $33 million, or 4%, in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher exchange processing fees, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses on bank loans, certain lower service fees due to lower trading volume, and net losses on sales of AFS securities in 2022. Exchange processing fees increased as a result of an SEC fee rate increase which became effective in the second quarter of 2022, and the provision for credit losses on bank loans increased as a result of higher loan loss factors driven primarily by higher forecasted interest rates and growth of the loan portfolio. In addition, other revenue in 2022 included $46 million in gains on the sale of Schwab Compliance Technologies, Inc. and certain investments. Other revenue increased $417 million, or 126%, in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the full-year inclusion of TD Ameritrade’s results in 2021. Other revenue attributable to TD Ameritrade totaled $462 million and $110 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.- 41 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Subsequent to year-end 2022, the SEC announced it would decrease its fee rates effective February 27, 2023 by approximately 65% from the rate in effect since May 2022. This change will result in lower exchange processing fees per security transaction in other revenue and a corresponding decrease in other expense, resulting in no impact to net income.Total Expenses Excluding InterestThe following table shows a comparison of total expenses excluding interest:Growth Rate 2021-2022202220212020Compensation and benefitsSalaries and wages12 %$3,527 $3,161 $2,416 Incentive compensation1 %1,458 1,443 932 Employee benefits and other12 %951 846 606 Total compensation and benefits9 %$5,936 $5,450 $3,954 Professional services4 %1,032 994 843 Occupancy and equipment20 %1,175 976 703 Advertising and market development(14)%419 485 326 Communications— 588 587 353 Depreciation and amortization19 %652 549 414 Amortization of acquired intangible assets(3)%596 615 190 Regulatory fees and assessments(5)%262 275 163 Other(18)%714 876 445 Total expenses excluding interest5 %$11,374 $10,807 $7,391 Expenses as a percentage of total net revenuesCompensation and benefits29 %29 %34 %Advertising and market development2 %3 %3 %Full-time equivalent employees (in thousands)At year end6 %35.333.432.0Average7 %34.732.523.9Total expenses excluding interest increased $567 million, or 5%, in 2022 from 2021, and $3.4 billion, or 46%, in 2021 from 2020. Adjusted total expenses, which excludes acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets, increased $662 million, or 7%, in 2022 from 2021 and $3.0 billion, or 44%, in 2021 from 2020. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results. Total compensation and benefits increased in 2022 from 2021 due to growth in employee headcount to support our expanding client base, annual merit increases, as well as a 5% employee salary increase and other targeted compensation adjustments that went into effect in late 2021. The 2021 increase reflected TDA’s full-year contribution of $1.2 billion of compensation and benefits expense compared with $453 million in 2020. The increase in 2021 was also due to additional headcount to support our expanding client base and service levels amidst heightened client engagement, a higher bonus accrual, annual merit increases, as well as a 5% employee salary increase and other targeted compensation adjustments that went into effect in late 2021. Compensation and benefits included acquisition and integration-related costs of $220 million, $283 million, and $235 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. In support of upcoming TDA client account transitions, we anticipate hiring additional headcount in 2023 to temporarily expand our client service capacity, which will result in higher compensation and benefits expense in 2023.Professional services expense increased in 2022 from 2021, primarily due to increased utilization of technology-related and other professional services to support overall growth of the business and enhancement to technological infrastructure to support our expanding client base, as well as the integration of TD Ameritrade. The increase in 2021 from 2020 was primarily due to the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations and overall growth in the business. Professional services included acquisition and integration-related costs of $140 million, $132 million, and $158 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. In support of - 42 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)upcoming TDA client account transitions, we anticipate additional integration-related professional services costs in 2023, which will result in higher professional services expense in 2023.Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2022 from 2021, primarily due to an increase in software maintenance and other agreements as well as other technology equipment costs to support growth of the business and the integration of TD Ameritrade. The increase in 2021 from 2020 was primarily due to the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations, costs related to the integration of TD Ameritrade, and overall growth in the business. Occupancy and equipment included acquisition and integration-related costs of $21 million and $39 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Advertising and market development expense decreased in 2022 from 2021, primarily as a result of decreases in spending for marketing communications for TD Ameritrade. The increase in 2021 from 2020 was primarily due the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations.Communications expense was flat in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase in 2021 from 2020 was primarily due to the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations, as well as higher communications expense due to higher customer trade volumes and overall growth of the business. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2022 from 2021, primarily as a result of higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software and higher depreciation of hardware, driven by capital expenditures in 2021 and 2022 to support the TDA integration and enhance our technological infrastructure to support growth of the business. The growth in depreciation and amortization in 2021 from 2020 was primarily due to growth in fixed assets from the TDA acquisition, and also reflected higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software and higher depreciation of hardware, as well as higher depreciation of buildings. Capital expenditures in 2022 and anticipated for 2023 as described below are expected to result in higher depreciation and amortization expense in 2023. Amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased slightly in 2022 from 2021, as certain assets from the TDA acquisition were fully amortized by the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in 2021 from 2020 was a result of our 2020 acquisitions.Regulatory fees and assessments decreased in 2022 from 2021, primarily as a result of lower client trading activity, partially offset by higher FDIC assessments and other regulatory assessments due to year-over-year average asset growth and overall growth of the business. The increase in 2021 from 2020 was primarily due to the inclusion of TDA’s results of operations and overall growth in the business, including higher FDIC assessments due to asset growth. The FDIC implemented a 2-basis-point increase to the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate, which became effective for the first quarterly assessment period in 2023. Dependent on average asset levels, this increase in the FDIC’s deposit insurance assessment may result in an increase in regulatory fees and assessments in 2023. See Item 1 – Regulation for additional information.Other expense decreased in 2022 from 2021, primarily due to the recognition of a charge of approximately $200 million for a now-settled regulatory matter in 2021 (see Item 8 – Note 15), partially offset by higher exchange processing fees as a result of fee rate increases beginning in the second quarter of 2022 and also higher clearing charges. The increase in 2021 from 2020 was primarily due to inclusion of TDA’s results of operations and the charge of the regulatory matter, partially offset by lower clearing charges and exchange fees. Subsequent to year-end 2022, the SEC announced it would decrease its fee rates effective February 27, 2023 by approximately 65% from the rate in effect since May 2022. This change will result in lower exchange processing fees per security transaction in other expense and a corresponding decrease in other revenue, resulting in no impact to net income. Capital expenditures primarily include capitalized software costs, information technology and telecommunications equipment, and buildings. Total capital expenditures were $952 million, $1,041 million, and $741 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Capital expenditures decreased 9% in 2022 compared to 2021, as higher capitalized software costs were offset by lower building expansion and capitalized information technology equipment. Extensive work continued in 2022 on the integration of TDA and enhancement of our technological infrastructure to support greater capacity for our expanding client base. Capital expenditures increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher information technology and telecommunications equipment and higher capitalized software costs reflecting investments made to support our TDA integration efforts and an expanding client base, partially offset by lower building expansion. Capitalized software costs totaled $614 million, $559 million, and $453 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Investments in information technology and telecommunications equipment were $280 million, $340 million, and $60 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Investments in buildings were $22 million, $102 million, and $173 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. - 43 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Capital expenditures were 5% of total net revenues in 2022, within our estimated range for the year. In 2023, we will continue to invest to support the TDA integration and greater capacity for our expanding client base, and we anticipate capital expenditures in 2023 will be approximately 3-4% of total net revenues. Our longer term expectation for capital expenditures remains in the range of 3-5% of total net revenues.Taxes on IncomeSchwab’s effective income tax rate on income before taxes was 23.5% in 2022, 24.1% in 2021, and 23.3% in 2020. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2022 from 2021 was primarily related to the reversal of tax reserves in 2022 due to the resolution of certain state tax matters and tax benefits recognized on the portion of the 2021 regulatory matter charge (see Item 8 – Note 15) that was determined upon final settlement to be deductible. Partially offsetting the decreases in the effective tax rate from these items was a decrease in equity compensation tax deduction benefits, higher state income tax rates, and an increase in non-deductible compensation in 2022. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2021 from 2020 was primarily related to non-recurring federal tax benefits recognized in 2020, including settlement of the IRS examination for tax years 2011-2014, the tax impact of the 2021 regulatory matter charge, and additional income tax expense from the filing of 2020 tax returns during 2021. Partially offsetting the increases in the effective tax rate from these items was an increase in equity compensation tax deduction benefits during 2021.Segment InformationRevenues and expenses are attributed to the two segments based on which segment services the client. Management evaluates the performance of the segments on a pre-tax basis. Segment assets and liabilities are not used for evaluating segment performance or in deciding how to allocate resources to segments. Net revenues in both segments are generated from the underlying client assets and trading activity; differences in the composition of net revenues between the segments are based on the composition of client assets, client trading frequency, and pricing unique to each. While both segments leverage the scale and efficiency of our platforms, segment expenses reflect the dynamics of serving millions of clients in Investor Services versus the thousands of RIAs on the Advisor Services platform.The Company integrated its business and asset acquisitions during 2020 into its two existing reportable segments. Revenues and expenses from our acquisition of USAA-IMCO are allocated to Investor Services only; revenues and expenses from TD Ameritrade and our other 2020 acquisitions are attributed to both Investor Services and Advisor Services based on which segment services the client. See Item 8 – Note 3 for more information regarding business acquisitions.- 44 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Financial information for our segments is presented in the following table:Investor ServicesAdvisor ServicesTotalGrowth Rate2021-2022202220212020Growth Rate2021-2022202220212020Growth Rate2021-2022202220212020Year Ended December 31,Net Revenues Net interest revenue29%$7,819 $6,052$4,391 45%$2,863 $1,978 $1,722 33%$10,682 $8,030 $6,113 Asset management and administration fees(3)%3,049 3,1302,544 2%1,167 1,144 931 (1)%4,216 4,274 3,475 Trading revenue(15)%3,181 3,7531,156 23%492 399 260 (12)%3,673 4,152 1,416 Bank deposit account fees(5)%916 964255 40%493 351 100 7%1,409 1,315 355 Other8%605 562262 (5)%177 187 70 4%782 749 332 Total net revenues8%15,570 14,4618,608 28%5,192 4,059 3,083 12%20,762 18,520 11,691 Expenses Excluding Interest3%8,514 8,2895,529 14%2,860 2,518 1,862 5%11,374 10,807 7,391 Income before taxes on income14%$7,056 $6,172$3,079 51%$2,332 $1,541 $1,221 22%$9,388 $7,713 $4,300 Net new client assets (in billions) (1,2,3)(9)%$182.8 $200.9$1,106.4(29)%$224.1 $315.3 $846.1 (21)%$406.9 $516.2 $1,952.5 (1) In 2022 and 2021, Investor Services includes outflows of $20.8 billion and $42.0 billion, respectively, from mutual fund clearing services clients. In 2020, Investor Services includes inflows of $10.9 billion from mutual fund clearing services clients. (2) In 2020, Investor Services includes inflows of $890.7 billion related to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and $79.9 billion related to the acquisition of assets of USAA-IMCO. (3) In 2020, Advisor Services includes inflows of $680.6 billion related to the acquisition of TD Ameritrade and $8.5 billion related to the acquisition of Wasmer Schroeder. Segment Net RevenuesInvestor Services and Advisor Services total net revenues increased by 8% and 28%, respectively, in 2022 compared to 2021. Investor Services growth was primarily driven by increases in net interest revenue as described above, partially offset by decreases in trading revenue due to lower client trading activity and changes in the mix of trading activity, resulting in lower commissions and order flow revenue, and a decrease in bank deposit account fees. Advisor Services growth was primarily driven by increases in net interest revenue as described above, as well as increases in trading revenue primarily due to higher trading volume amid market volatility and bank deposit account fees primarily due to a rising interest rate environment. Asset management and administration fees were essentially flat for Advisor Services, while declining slightly for Investor Services as equity market weakness during 2022 weighed on client asset valuations, partially offset by the elimination of money market fund fee waivers. Other revenues increased for Investor Services in 2022 from 2021 due to higher exchange processing fees, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses on bank loans, certain lower service fees, and lower net gains on sales of AFS securities.Investor Services and Advisor Services total net revenues increased by 68% and 32%, respectively, in 2021 compared to 2020. Both segments experienced growth in all revenue line items, primarily due to the full-year inclusion of TD Ameritrade’s results in 2021. In addition, net interest revenue increased for Advisor Services due to growth in interest-earning assets, partially offset by lower average yields. Growth in asset management and administration fees in Investor Services was supported by growth in advice solutions, and asset management and administration fees increased in both segments due to rising balances in proprietary and third-party mutual funds and ETFs, partially offset by money market fund fee waivers and lower money market fund balances. The increase in trading revenue for Investor Services was supported by heightened client trading activity. Bank deposit account fee revenue was earned at both segments for the full year in 2021 compared to only the fourth quarter of 2020, following the October 6, 2020 TD Ameritrade acquisition. Segment Expenses Excluding InterestInvestor Services and Advisor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 3% and 14%, respectively, in 2022 compared to 2021. Both segments saw higher compensation and benefits expenses due to increases in headcount to support our expanding client base, annual merit increases, as well as a 5% employee salary increase and other targeted compensation adjustments that went into effect in late 2021. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased in both segments, primarily due to an increase in software maintenance and other agreements as well as other technology equipment costs to support growth of the business and the integration of TD Ameritrade. In addition, depreciation and amortization increased for both segments primarily - 45 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)due to higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software and higher depreciation of hardware, driven by capital expenditures in 2021 and 2022 to enhance our technological infrastructure to support growth of the business. For Investor Services, these increases were partially offset by lower other expenses due to a charge of approximately $200 million in 2021 for a now-settled regulatory matter (see Item 8 – Note 15), partially offset by higher exchange fees and clearing charges, and lower advertising and market development expense due to reduced spending for marketing communications for TD Ameritrade.Investor Services and Advisor Services total expenses excluding interest increased by 50% and 35%, respectively, in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of TD Ameritrade’s results of operations. In addition, both segments saw higher compensation and benefits expenses due to additional headcount increases to support our expanding client base and service levels amidst heightened client engagement, higher bonus accrual, as well as annual merit increases and a 5% employee salary increase that went into effect late in the third quarter of 2021. For Investor Services, total expenses excluding interest also increased due to a charge of approximately $200 million in 2021 for a regulatory matter (see Item 8 – Note 15). RISK MANAGEMENTSchwab’s business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks. The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. Despite our efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that Schwab will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks.Our risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment, risk response, risk measurement and monitoring, and risk reporting and escalation; we use periodic risk and control self-assessments, control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The activities and governance that comprise the risk management process are described below.As part of our ongoing integration of TD Ameritrade, the Company has aligned TD Ameritrade’s risk management practices with Schwab’s risk appetite. Our integration work included evaluating new or changed risks impacting the combined company, and taking action through various means. Though integration work continues, the Company’s operations, inclusive of TD Ameritrade, remain consistent with our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework.CultureThe Board of Directors has approved an ERM framework that incorporates our purpose, vision, and values, which form the bedrock of our corporate culture and set the tone for the organization.We designed the ERM Framework to enable a comprehensive approach to managing risks encountered by Schwab in its business activities. The framework incorporates key concepts commensurate with the size, risk profile, complexity, and continuing growth of the Company. Risk appetite, which is defined as the amount of risk the Company is willing to accept in pursuit of its corporate strategy, is developed by executive management and approved by the Board of Directors.Risk GovernanceSenior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling risks. The Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior executives from each major business and control function, is responsible for the oversight of risk management. This includes identifying emerging risks, assessing risk management practices and the control environment, reinforcing business accountability for risk management, supervisory controls and regulatory compliance, supporting resource prioritization across the organization, and escalating significant issues to the Board of Directors.We have established risk metrics and reporting that enable measurement of the impact of strategy execution against risk appetite. The risk metrics, with risk limits and tolerance levels, are established for key risk categories by the Global Risk Committee and its functional risk sub-committees.The Chief Risk Officer regularly reports activities of the Global Risk Committee to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. The Board Risk Committee in turn assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect - 46 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)to our risk management program, including approving risk appetite statements and related key risk appetite metrics and reviewing reports relating to risk issues from functional areas of corporate risk management, legal, and internal audit.Functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report to the Global Risk Committee. These sub-committees include the:•Operational Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of and approves operational risk management policies, risk tolerance levels, and operational risk governance processes, and includes sub-committees covering Information Security, Technology, Fraud, Third-Party Risk, Data, and Model Governance;•Compliance Risk Committee – provides oversight of compliance risk management programs (inclusive of Anti-Money Laundering/Sanctions, Conduct, Fiduciary, and Privacy), policies, and risk tolerance levels providing an aggregate view of compliance risk exposure and employee conduct, including subcommittees covering Fiduciary and Conflicts of Interest Risk;•Financial Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of and approves credit, market, liquidity, and capital risk policies, limits, and exposures and includes the Liquidity and Capital Subcommittee; and•New Products and Services Risk Oversight Committee – provides oversight of, and approves corporate policy and procedures relating to, the risk governance of new products and services.Senior management has also created an Incentive Compensation Risk Oversight Committee, which establishes policy and reviews and approves the Annual Risk Assessment of incentive compensation plans, and reports directly to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Company’s finance, internal audit, legal, and corporate risk management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring risk management.In addition, the Disclosure Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.Operational RiskOperational risk arises due to potential inadequacies or failures related to internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events or relationships impacting the Company and/or any of its key business partners and vendors. While operational risk is inherent in all business activities, we rely on a system of internal controls and risk management practices designed to keep operational risk and operational losses within the Company’s risk appetite. We have specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and use control testing programs, and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. Where appropriate, we manage the impact of operational loss and litigation expense through the purchase of insurance. The insurance program is specifically designed to address our key operational risks and to maintain compliance with local laws and regulation.Schwab’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity and resilience of our critical business functions and technology systems. To the extent Schwab experiences business or system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, technological failure, cyber attacks, changes to systems, linkages with third-party systems, extreme weather, and power failures), our business and operations could be negatively impacted. To minimize business interruptions and ensure the capacity to continue operations during an incident regardless of duration, Schwab maintains a backup and recovery infrastructure which includes facilities for backup and communications, a geographically dispersed workforce, and routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans and a well-established incident management program.Information Security risk is the risk of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, recording or destruction of the firm’s information or systems. We have designed and implemented an information security program that knits together complementary tools, controls and technologies to protect systems, client accounts and data. We continuously monitor the systems and work collaboratively with government agencies, law enforcement and other financial institutions to address potential threats. We use advanced monitoring systems to identify suspicious activity and deter unauthorized access by internal or external actors. We also maintain policies and procedures, which apply to employees, contractors, and third parties, regarding the standard of care expected with all data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-- 47 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)public client information. This includes limiting the number of employees who have access to clients’ personal information and internal authentication measures enforced to protect against the unauthorized use of employee credentials. All employees who handle sensitive information are trained in privacy and security. Schwab’s conduct and cybersecurity teams monitor activity looking for suspicious behavior. These capabilities allow us to identify and quickly act on attempted intrusions.Fraud risk arises from attempted or actual theft of financial assets or other property of any client or the Company. Schwab is committed to protecting the Company’s and its clients’ assets from fraud and complying with all applicable laws and regulations to prevent, detect and report fraudulent activity. Schwab manages fraud risk through policies, procedures and controls. We also take affirmative steps to prevent and detect fraud and report, to appropriate authorities, any known or suspected acts of fraud in accordance with existing laws and requirements.Schwab also faces operational risk when we employ the services of various third parties, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. We manage the exposure to third-party risk and promote a culture of resiliency through internal policies, procedures and controls, and contractual provisions, control standards, ongoing monitoring of third-party performance, and appropriate testing with third-party service providers. Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. Models are owned by several business units throughout the organization, and are used for a variety of purposes. Model use includes, but is not limited to, calculating capital requirements for hypothetical stressful environments, estimating interest and credit risk for loans and other balance sheet assets, and providing guidance in the management of client portfolios. We have established a policy that aligns with regulatory guidance to describe the roles and responsibilities of all key stakeholders in model development, management, and use. All models are registered in a centralized database and classified into different risk ratings depending on their potential financial, reputational, or regulatory impact to the Company. The model risk rating determines the scope of model governance activities.Compliance RiskSchwab faces compliance risk which is the potential exposure to legal or regulatory sanctions, fines or penalties, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, or other regulatory requirements. Among other things, compliance risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of our controls. The Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, including SROs. We manage compliance risk through policies, procedures and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, privacy, and employment policies. Privacy risk is the risk of unauthorized collection, use, storage, or sharing of personal information, including data incidents and other mismanagement of personal information. We manage privacy risk through policies, procedures, and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with these laws and regulations.Anti-money laundering/Sanctions risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, fines or penalties, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) and Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)/global sanctions (collectively, “AML”) laws, regulations, rules, or other regulatory requirements. Schwab manages this risk through daily monitoring, a system of internal controls, education and training for appropriate personnel, and developing risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence and complying with beneficial ownership requirements for legal entity customers.Conduct risk arises from inappropriate, unethical, or unlawful behavior of the Company, its employees or third parties acting on the Company’s behalf that may result in detriment to the Company’s clients, financial markets, the Company, and/or the Company’s employees. We manage this risk through policies, procedures, a system of internal controls, including personnel monitoring and surveillance. Conduct-related matters are escalated through appropriate channels by the Corporate Responsibility Officer.- 48 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. We manage this risk by establishing policy and procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the policy and procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees.Incentive Compensation risk is the potential for adverse consequences resulting from compensation plans that do not balance the execution of our strategy with risk and financial rewards, potentially encouraging imprudent risk-taking by employees. We have implemented risk management processes, including a policy, to identify, evaluate, assess, and manage risks associated with incentive compensation plans and the activities of certain employees, defined as Covered Employees, who have the authority to expose the Company to material amounts of risk.Credit RiskCredit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations. Our exposure to credit risk mainly results from investing activities in our liquidity and investment portfolios, mortgage lending, margin lending and client option and futures activities, pledged asset lending, securities lending activities, and our role as a counterparty in other financial contracts. To manage the risks of such losses, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin, PAL, option, and futures requirements for certain securities and instruments. Liquidity and Investment PortfoliosSchwab has exposure to credit risk associated with its investment portfolios, which include U.S. agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, U.S. Treasury securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. state and municipal securities, commercial paper, and foreign government agency securities.At December 31, 2022, substantially all securities in the investment portfolios were rated investment grade. U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.Mortgage Lending PortfolioThe bank loan portfolio includes First Mortgages, HELOCs, PALs (discussed below), and other loans. The credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual loan and portfolio reviews. Management regularly reviews asset quality, including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses.Our residential loan underwriting guidelines include maximum LTV ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan size is conforming or jumbo). Schwab does not originate or purchase residential loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. For more information on credit quality indicators relating to Schwab’s bank loans, see Item 8 – Note 7. Securities and Instrument-Based Lending PortfoliosCollateral arrangements relating to margin loans, PALs, option and futures positions, securities lending agreements, and securities purchased under agreements to resell (resale agreements) include provisions that require additional collateral in the event of market fluctuations. Additionally, for margin loans, PALs, options and futures positions, and securities lending agreements, collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral sufficiently exceeds the credit exposure in order to maintain a fully secured position.- 49 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Other Counterparty ExposuresSchwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab’s clients or a counterparty fail to meet their obligations to the Company.Market RiskMarket risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by Schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, or market conditions. Schwab is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates within our interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of funding sources that finance these assets. To manage interest rate risk, we have established policies and procedures, which include setting limits on net interest revenue risk and economic value of equity (EVE) risk. To remain within these limits, we manage the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios. We may also utilize derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps to assist with managing interest rate risk. Management monitors established guidelines to stay within the Company’s risk appetite.Our measurement of interest rate risk involves assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue, bank deposit account fees, or EVE. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies, including changes in asset and liability mix. Financial instruments are also subject to the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument. We are indirectly exposed to option, futures, and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option and futures accounts, securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers, and client securities loaned out as part of the brokerage securities lending activities. Equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity, margin borrowing, and overall client engagement with Schwab. Additionally, we earn mutual fund and ETF service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets. Fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue we earn.Our market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material. Interest Rate Risk SimulationsNet Interest Revenue SimulationFor our net interest revenue sensitivity analysis, we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulations include all balance sheet interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities. Key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, repricing of financial instruments, and reinvestment of matured or paid-down securities and loans. Net interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may reprice at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short- and long-term interest rates. Interest-earning assets include investment securities, margin loans, bank loans, and cash and cash equivalents. These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment. Because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans, and control the composition of our investment securities, we have some ability to manage our net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions.Net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment. - 50 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Higher short-term interest rates would positively impact net interest margin as yields on interest-earning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources. A decline in short-term interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the Company’s investment and loan portfolios to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources, compressing net interest margin. The following table shows the simulated change to net interest revenue over the next 12 months beginning December 31, 2022 and 2021 of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period:December 31,20222021Increase of 100 basis points3.6%14.1%Decrease of 100 basis points(3.2)%(4.5)%The Company’s simulated increase of 100 basis points in market interest rates had a lower impact on net interest revenue at year-end 2022 compared with year-end 2021 primarily due to an increased sensitivity to the Company’s higher projected client deposit rates, lower special reserve and margin loan balances at the Company’s broker-dealer subsidiaries, and reduced cash and adjustable-rate balances across the Company’s banking entities. A simulated decrease of 100 basis points in market interest rates had a lower impact on net interest revenue at year-end 2022 compared to the prior year-end primarily due to higher starting client deposit rates which, relative to the December 31, 2021 simulation, provide greater responsiveness to lower simulated interest rates.In addition to measuring the effect of a gradual 100 basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates, we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel- and non-parallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue.Bank Deposit Account Fees SimulationConsistent with the presentation on the consolidated statement of income, the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to interest rate changes is assessed separately from the net interest revenue simulation described above. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, simulated changes in bank deposit account fee revenue from gradual 100 basis point changes in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates did not have a significant impact on the Company’s total net revenues. Economic Value of Equity SimulationManagement also uses EVE simulations to measure interest rate risk. EVE sensitivity measures the long-term impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates. This analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment. Key assumptions in our EVE calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors, prepayment speeds of mortgage-related investments, term structure models of interest rates, non-maturity deposit behavior, and pricing assumptions. Our net interest revenue, bank deposit account fee revenue, and EVE simulations reflect the assumption of non-negative investment yields.Phase-out of LIBOR The Company continues to prepare for the phasing-out of LIBOR with efforts coordinated by its firm-wide transition team. The LIBOR transition team is overseen by executive leadership and has organized its work to address both client-impacting and non-client-impacting workstreams. From a client perspective, the Company has established pages on the client-facing websites for CS&Co and TD Ameritrade, Inc. to provide information for our clients to help them understand how they may be impacted by LIBOR’s discontinuation. In addition, we maintain internal informational resources for our client-facing employees’ awareness regarding LIBOR’s phase-out. The Company’s largest exposures to LIBOR are certain investment securities and loans. In purchasing new investment securities, we ensure that appropriate fallback language is in place in the event that LIBOR becomes unavailable or is deemed unreliable, and we have sold certain securities lacking appropriate fallback language. Additionally, in accordance with regulatory feedback, we are limiting our purchases of LIBOR-based securities, and we ensure that any new purchases of LIBOR-based securities were issued prior to January 1, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, substantially all of the Company’s remaining investment securities with exposure to LIBOR provide for appropriate fallback in the event LIBOR is no longer available. Consistent with guidance from the Alternative Reference Rate Committee, a group of private-market participants jointly - 51 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to help ensure a successful transition from LIBOR, beginning in 2022, the Company no longer uses LIBOR as a reference rate in new loans, and the Company’s portfolio of legacy loans have fallback language if LIBOR is no longer available.Certain of the Company’s technology systems and financial models have historically utilized LIBOR, and we have now substantially transitioned our financial models and systems to alternative reference rates. In addition, we have transitioned the Company’s IDA agreement and certain intercompany lending agreements that previously were tied to LIBOR to other appropriate reference rates. On March 15, 2022, President Biden signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022 into law, which includes the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, containing legislation related to the transition away from LIBOR. This legislation is intended to establish a uniform process for replacing LIBOR in existing contracts and securities that continue after the cessation of LIBOR and do not contain clearly defined or practicable fallback provisions. On December 16, 2022, the Federal Reserve Board adopted the final rule that implements the LIBOR Act. The final rule provides default rules for certain contracts that use LIBOR, which would implement the LIBOR Act with replacement rates based on SOFR. The Company believes the LIBOR Act and the Federal Reserve Board’s final regulation help provide clarity for the transition of our legacy LIBOR contracts, including investment securities and loans to alternative reference rates in an orderly manner.Additional transition efforts to prepare for the phasing-out of LIBOR are ongoing. In 2022, Schwab redeemed Series A and Series E preferred stock; both of which referenced LIBOR for dividend payments. In addition, operational work is underway to transition our legacy loan portfolio, in accordance with regulatory guidance, to alternate reference rates by the first rate reset after LIBOR’s cessation. Liquidity RiskLiquidity risk is the potential that Schwab will be unable to sell assets or meet cash flow obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses.Due to its role as a source of financial strength, CSC’s liquidity needs are primarily driven by the liquidity and capital needs of: CS&Co, TD Ameritrade, Inc., and TDAC, our principal broker-dealer subsidiaries; the capital needs of the banking subsidiaries; principal and interest due on corporate debt; dividend payments on CSC’s preferred stock; and returns of capital to common stockholders. The liquidity needs of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are primarily driven by client activity including trading and margin lending activities and capital expenditures. The capital needs of the banking subsidiaries are primarily driven by client deposit levels. We have established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies, while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions. We seek to maintain client confidence in the balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the Company to meet its obligations. To this end, we have established limits and contingency funding plans to support liquidity levels during both business as usual and stressed conditions.We employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity. We conduct regular liquidity stress testing to develop a view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific liquidity stress events. Liquidity sources are also tested periodically and results are reported to the Financial Risk Oversight Committee. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the organization and are reviewed with management as appropriate.Primary Funding SourcesSchwab’s primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity which includes bank deposits and cash balances in client brokerage accounts. These funds are used to purchase investment securities and extend loans to clients. Other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, repayments on loans, securities lending of assets held in client brokerage accounts, repurchase agreements, and cash provided by external financing including securities issuances by CSC in the capital markets.- 52 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)To meet daily funding needs, we maintain liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments. For unanticipated liquidity needs, we also maintain a buffer of highly liquid investments, including U.S. Treasury securities.Additional Funding SourcesIn addition to internal sources of liquidity, Schwab has access to external funding. The need for short-term borrowings from external debt facilities arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest-earning investments, movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements, and general corporate purposes. We maintain policies and procedures necessary to access funding and test discount window borrowing procedures on a periodic basis.The following table describes external debt facilities available at December 31, 2022:DescriptionBorrowerOutstandingAvailableMaturity of Amounts OutstandingWeighted-Average Interest Rate on Amounts OutstandingFederal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) secured credit facilitiesBanking subsidiaries$12,400 $68,562 June 2023 - November 20234.88%Federal Reserve discount windowBanking subsidiaries— 7,783 N/A—Repurchase agreementsBanking subsidiaries4,402 — (1)August 2023 - September 20234.99%Uncommitted, unsecured lines of credit with various external banksCSC, CS&Co— 1,607 N/A—Unsecured commercial paperCSC250 4,750 March 20234.67%Secured uncommitted lines of credit with various external banksTDAC— — (2)N/A—(1) Secured borrowing capacity is made available based on the banking subsidiaries’ ability to provide collateral deemed acceptable by each respective counterparty. See Item 8 – Note 17 for additional information.(2) Secured borrowing capacity is made available based on TDAC’s ability to provide acceptable collateral to the lenders as determined by the credit agreements.Our banking subsidiaries maintain secured credit facilities with the FHLB. Amounts available under these facilities are dependent on the value of our First Mortgages, HELOCs, and the fair value of certain of our investment securities that are pledged as collateral. These credit facilities are also available as backup financing in the event the outflow of client cash from the banking subsidiaries’ respective balance sheets is greater than maturities and paydowns on investment securities and bank loans. CSC’s banking subsidiaries must each maintain positive tangible capital, as defined by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, in order to place new draws upon these credit facilities, and the Company manages capital with consideration of minimum tangible capital ratios at our banking subsidiaries. Tangible capital pursuant to the requirements of the FHLB borrowing facilities for our banking subsidiaries is common equity less goodwill and intangible assets.Our banking subsidiaries also have access to short-term secured funding through the Federal Reserve discount window. Amounts available under the Federal Reserve discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain investment securities that are pledged as collateral. Our banking subsidiaries may also engage with external financial institutions in repurchase agreements collateralized by investment securities as another source of short-term liquidity. Our banking subsidiaries are also counterparties to the standing repo facility with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.CSC has a commercial paper program of which proceeds are used for general corporate purposes. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes may vary, but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue. CSC’s ratings for these short-term borrowings were P1 by Moody’s, A1 by Standard & Poor’s, and F1 by Fitch at December 31, 2022 and 2021. CSC also has a universal automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, which enables it to issue debt, equity, and other securities.- 53 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)CS&Co maintains uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines with a group of banks as a source of short-term liquidity, which can also be accessed by CSC. TDAC maintains secured uncommitted lines of credit, under which TDAC borrows on either a demand or short-term basis and pledges client margin securities as collateral. The following table provides information about retail brokered certificates of deposit issued at CSB in the fourth quarter of 2022 and outstanding as of December 31, 2022:Amount OutstandingMaturityWeighted-Average Interest RateRetail brokered certificates of deposit$6,047 September 2023 - December 20234.75%As a result of rapidly increasing short-term interest rates in 2022, the Company saw an increase in the pace at which clients moved certain cash balances out of our sweep features and into higher yielding alternatives. As these outflows have continued, they have outpaced excess cash on hand and cash generated by maturities and paydowns on our investment portfolios. In the fourth quarter of 2022, our banking subsidiaries began to raise temporary supplemental term funding via a variety of sources, including both fixed- and floating-rate FHLB advances, repurchase agreements, and the issuance of retail brokered certificates of deposit. The Company expects to use these types of temporary supplemental funding, until the Company’s primary sources of liquidity are again greater than any outflows associated with client cash allocation decisions. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company’s banking entities had drawn an additional $13.0 billion of FHLB advances. The current average interest rate on these advances was 5.12%, with the earliest maturity occurring in June 2023. Our banking subsidiaries also borrowed an additional $3.4 billion under repurchase agreements with external financial institutions subsequent to December 31, 2022. The current average interest rate on these repurchase borrowings was 4.91% with the earliest maturity occurring in March 2023. The Company also issued $9.4 billion of retail brokered certificates of deposit subsequent to December 31, 2022 at a weighted average interest rate of 4.71%, with the earliest maturity occurring in July 2023.Liquidity Coverage RatioSchwab is subject to the full LCR rule, which requires the Company to hold HQLA in an amount equal to at least 100% of the Company’s projected net cash outflows over a prospective 30-calendar-day period of acute liquidity stress, calculated on each business day. See Item 1 – Regulation for additional information. The Company was in compliance with the LCR rule at December 31, 2022, and the table below presents information about our average daily LCR: Average for theThree Months Ended December 31, 2022Total eligible HQLA$93,986 Net cash outflows$76,754 LCR123 %To support growth in margin loan balances at our broker-dealer subsidiaries while meeting our LCR requirements, the Company may issue commercial paper or draw on secured lines of credit, in addition to capital markets issuances.Long-Term BorrowingsThe Company’s long-term debt is primarily comprised of Senior Notes and totaled $20.8 billion and $18.9 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

For information on our contractual - 55 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)obligations for credit-related financial instruments, short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and leases, see Part II, Item 8 – Notes 15, 13, and 14, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had total short-term purchase obligations of $562 million and total long-term purchase obligations of $510 million.Schwab also enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements in the ordinary course of business. For information on these arrangements, see Item 8 – Notes 7, 11, 13, 15, and 17. Pursuant to the IDA agreement, certain brokerage client deposits are required to be swept off-balance sheet to the TD Depository Institutions. See Item 8 – Note 15 for additional information on the IDA agreement.CAPITAL MANAGEMENT Schwab seeks to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support execution of our business strategy, including anticipated balance sheet growth inclusive of migration of IDA balances (see further discussion below), providing financial support to our subsidiaries, and sustained access to the capital markets, while at the same time meeting our regulatory capital requirements and serving as a source of financial strength to our banking subsidiaries. Schwab also seeks to return excess capital to stockholders. We may return excess capital through such activities as dividends, repurchases of common shares, preferred stock redemptions, and repurchases of our preferred stock represented by depositary shares. Schwab’s primary sources of capital are funds generated by the operations of subsidiaries and securities issuances by CSC in the capital markets.To ensure that Schwab has sufficient capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values, we have adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios. Internal guidelines are set, for both CSC and its regulated subsidiaries, to ensure capital levels are in line with our strategy and regulatory requirements. Capital forecasts are reviewed monthly at Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee and Financial Risk Oversight Committee meetings. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify potential problems that could impact capital. In addition, we monitor the subsidiaries’ capital levels and requirements. Subject to regulatory capital requirements and any required approvals, any excess capital held by subsidiaries is transferred to CSC in the form of dividends and returns of capital. At the banking subsidiaries, dividends and returns of capital are managed with consideration of minimum tangible common equity levels and sufficient capital above regulatory capital requirements. When subsidiaries have need of additional capital, funds are provided by CSC as equity investments and also as subordinated loans. The details and method used for each cash infusion are based on an analysis of the particular entity’s needs and financing alternatives. The amounts and structure of infusions take into consideration maintenance of regulatory capital requirements, debt/equity ratios, and equity double leverage ratios.Schwab conducts regular capital stress testing to assess the potential financial impacts of various adverse macroeconomic and company-specific events to which the Company could be subjected. The objective of the capital stress testing is (1) to explore various potential outcomes – including rare and extreme events and (2) to assess impacts of potential stressful outcomes on both capital and liquidity. Additionally, we have a comprehensive Capital Contingency Plan to provide action plans for certain low probability/high impact capital events that the Company might face. The Capital Contingency Plan is issued under the authority of the Financial Risk Oversight Committee and provides guidelines for sustained capital events. It does not specifically address every contingency, but is designed to provide a framework for responding to any capital stress. The results of the stress testing indicate there are two scenarios which could stress the Company’s capital: (1) inflows of balance sheet cash during a period of very low interest rates and (2) outflows of balance sheet cash when other sources of financing are not available and the Company is required to sell assets to fund the flows at a loss. The Capital Contingency Plan is reviewed annually and updated as appropriate.For additional information, see Business – Regulation in Part I, Item 1.Regulatory Capital RequirementsCSC is subject to capital requirements set by the Federal Reserve and is required to serve as a source of strength for our banking subsidiaries and to provide financial assistance if our banking subsidiaries experience financial distress. Schwab is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for CSC of at least 4%, and we have a long-term operating objective. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company lowered its long-term operating objective for the consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio down 25 basis points from 6.75%-7.00% to 6.50%-6.75%. Due to the relatively low risk of our balance sheet assets and risk-based capital ratios at CSC and CSB that are well in excess of regulatory requirements, the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint on CSC’s asset growth.- 56 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)Our banking subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements set by their regulators that are substantially similar to those imposed on CSC by the Federal Reserve. Our banking subsidiaries’ failure to remain well capitalized could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that could have a direct material effect on the banks. Schwab’s principal banking subsidiary, CSB, is required to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of at least 5% to be well capitalized, but seeks to maintain a ratio of at least 6.25%. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2022, CSB is considered well capitalized.Our banking subsidiaries are required to provide notice to, and may be required to obtain approval from, the Federal Reserve and the banking subsidiaries’ state regulators in order to declare and pay dividends to CSC. In 2023, we expect to be required to obtain approval from the Federal Reserve for our banking subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends in excess of the amount of recent net income and retained earnings. As broker-dealers, CS&Co, TDAC, and TD Ameritrade, Inc., are subject to regulatory requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule, which is intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit the broker-dealer subsidiaries from paying cash dividends, making unsecured advances and loans to CSC and employees, and repaying subordinated borrowings from CSC if such payment would result in a net capital amount below prescribed thresholds. At December 31, 2022, CS&Co, TDAC, and TD Ameritrade, Inc. were in compliance with their respective net capital requirements.In addition to the capital requirements above, Schwab’s subsidiaries are subject to other regulatory requirements intended to ensure financial soundness and liquidity. See Item 8 – Note 23 for additional information on the components of stockholders’ equity and information on the capital requirements of significant subsidiaries.The following table details the capital ratios for CSC consolidated and CSB:December 31,20222021CSCCSBCSCCSBTotal stockholders’ equity$36,608 $7,664 $56,261 $27,035 Less:Preferred stock9,706 — 9,954 — Common Equity Tier 1 Capital before regulatory adjustments$26,902 $7,664 $46,307 $27,035 Less:Goodwill, net of associated deferred tax liabilities$11,816 $13 $11,857 $13 Other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities7,079 — 7,579 — Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances and deferred tax liabilities37 35 13 12 AOCI adjustment (1)(22,620)(19,680)(1,109)(1,004)Common Equity Tier 1 Capital $30,590 $27,296 $27,967 $28,014 Tier 1 Capital$40,296 $27,296 $37,921 $28,014 Total Capital40,376 27,370 37,950 28,033 Risk-Weighted Assets139,657 99,631 141,969 104,409 Total Leverage Exposure566,809 375,846 614,466 400,532 Common Equity Tier 1 Capital/Risk-Weighted Assets21.9 %27.4 %19.7 %26.8 %Tier 1 Capital/Risk-Weighted Assets28.9 %27.4 %26.7 %26.8 %Total Capital/Risk-Weighted Assets28.9 %27.5 %26.7 %26.8 %Tier 1 Leverage Ratio7.2 %7.3 %6.2 %7.1 %Supplementary Leverage Ratio7.1 %7.3 %6.2 %7.0 %(1) Changes in market interest rates can result in unrealized gains or losses on AFS securities, which are included in AOCI. As a Category III banking organization, CSC has elected to exclude AOCI from regulatory capital.The Company’s consolidated Tier 1 Leverage Ratio increased to 7.2% at December 31, 2022 from 6.2% at year-end 2021. This increase resulted primarily from lower bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients, which decreased by a total of $105.3 billion, or 18%, in 2022 due to client cash allocation decisions resulting from the rising interest rate environment; strength in earnings in 2022; and our March 2022 issuance of Series K preferred stock. Partially offsetting these factors were - 57 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)common stock repurchases of $3.4 billion and $1.0 billion in preferred stock redemptions. CSB’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio also increased from year-end 2021, ending 2022 at 7.3%. In January and November of 2022, the Company transferred investment securities from the AFS category to the HTM category, with aggregate fair values of $108.8 billion and $79.8 billion, respectively, and net unrealized losses at the time of transfer of $2.4 billion and $15.8 billion, respectively. The transfer of these securities to the HTM category reduces the Company’s exposure to fluctuations in AOCI that can result from unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities due to changes in market interest rates. The unrealized loss at the time of transfer is amortized over the remaining life of the security, offsetting the amortization of the security’s premium or discount, and resulting in no impact to net income.IDA AgreementCertain brokerage client deposits are swept off-balance sheet to the TD Depository Institutions pursuant to the IDA agreement. During 2022 and 2021, Schwab moved net amounts of $13.7 billion and $10.1 billion, respectively, of IDA balances to its balance sheet. The Company’s overall capital management strategy includes supporting migration of IDA balances in future periods as available pursuant to the terms of the IDA agreement. The Company’s ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent upon multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain these incremental deposits. See Item 8 – Note 15 for further information on the IDA agreement.DividendsSince the initial dividend in 1989, and as of December 31, 2022, CSC has paid 135 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend rate 27 times, resulting in a 20% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, CSC currently targets its common and nonvoting common stock cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income.The Board of Directors of the Company declared quarterly cash dividend increases per common share during 2022 as shown below:Date of DeclarationQuarterly Cash Increase Per Common Share% IncreaseNew Quarterly Dividend Per Common ShareJanuary 26, 2022$.02 11 %$.20 July 27, 2022.02 10 %.22 In addition, on January 26, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a three cent, or 14%, increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $.25 per common share.- 58 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)The following table details CSC’s cash dividends paid and per share amounts:Year Ended December 31,20222021Cash PaidPer ShareAmountCash PaidPer ShareAmountCommon and Nonvoting Common Stock$1,591 $.84 $1,366 $.72 Preferred Stock:Series A (1)33 82.73 28 70.00 Series C (2)N/AN/A18 30.00 Series D (3)45 59.52 45 59.52 Series E (4)37 6,161.42 28 4,625.00 Series F (5)25 5,000.00 25 5,000.00 Series G (3)134 5,375.00 134 5,375.00 Series H (6)100 4,000.00 97 3,888.89 Series I (7)90 4,000.00 63 2,811.11 Series J (8)27 44.52 18 29.80 Series K (9)28 3,708.33 N/AN/A(1) Series A was redeemed on November 1, 2022.

The new share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date. On August 1, 2022, CSC purchased, directly from an affiliate of TD Bank, 15 million shares of nonvoting common stock for a total of $1.0 billion, or approximately $66.53 per share. The shares of nonvoting common stock automatically converted into common stock and were purchased under CSC’s new share repurchase authorization. The purchase price paid by CSC was equal to the lowest price per share that the affiliate of TD Bank received in a contemporaneous share sale facilitated by a third-party market maker, which resulted in a purchase price lower than the closing price on August 1, 2022. CSC repurchased an additional 32 million shares of its common stock under the new authorization for $2.4 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022. There were no repurchases of CSC’s common stock under the terminated authorization during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.As of December 31, 2022, $11.6 billion remained on the new authorization. Beginning in 2023, share repurchases, net of issuances, are subject to a nondeductible 1% excise tax which we expect to recognize as a direct and incremental cost associated with these transactions. For repurchases of common stock, we expect the tax will be recorded as part of the cost basis of the treasury stock repurchased, resulting in no income statement impact.FOREIGN EXPOSUREAt December 31, 2022, Schwab had exposure to non-sovereign financial and non-financial institutions in foreign countries, as well as agencies of foreign governments. At December 31, 2022, the fair value of these holdings totaled $16.4 billion, with the top three exposures being to issuers and counterparties domiciled in France at $5.1 billion, the United Kingdom at $4.8 billion, and Canada at $1.7 billion. At December 31, 2021, the fair value of these holdings totaled $12.5 billion, with the top three exposures being to issuers and counterparties domiciled in the United Kingdom at $5.2 billion, France at $3.9 billion, and Sweden at $754 million. In addition, Schwab had outstanding margin loans to foreign residents of $2.5 billion and $3.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. - 59 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSSchwab uses the market approach to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, and to determine fair value disclosures. See Item 8 – Notes 2 and 18 for more information on our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe consolidated financial statements of Schwab have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Item 8 – Note 2 contains more information on our significant accounting policies made in applying these accounting principles.While the majority of the revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on Schwab’s financial position and financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy.Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Additionally, management has reviewed with the Audit Committee the Company’s significant estimates discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Income TaxesSchwab estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, including federal, state and local domestic jurisdictions, and immaterial amounts owed to several foreign jurisdictions. The estimated income tax expense is reported in the consolidated statements of income in taxes on income. Accrued taxes are reported in other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to future periods. Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. In estimating accrued taxes, we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position. Because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations, interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances.Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be significant to the operating results of the Company. See Item 8 – Note 22 for more information on the Company’s income taxes.Legal and Regulatory ReservesReserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved. See Item 8 – Note 15 for more information on the Company’s contingencies related to legal and regulatory reserves.Business CombinationsWe have accounted for our acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date as we allocate the purchase price to the estimated fair values of acquired tangible and intangible assets and the liabilities assumed. We also use our best estimates to determine the - 60 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)useful lives of the tangible and definite-lived intangible assets, which impact the periods over which depreciation and amortization of those assets are recognized. These best estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain as they pertain to forward looking views of our businesses, client behavior, and market conditions. In our acquisitions, we have also recognized goodwill at the amount by which the purchase price paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. See Item 8 – Notes 2 and 3 for more information on our valuation methods and the results of applying the acquisition method of accounting, including the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and, where relevant, the estimated remaining useful lives.Our ongoing accounting for goodwill and the tangible and intangible assets acquired requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions as we exercise judgement to evaluate these assets for impairment. Our processes and accounting policies for evaluating impairments are further described in Item 8 – Note 2. One of our reporting units has an immaterial amount of goodwill. The results of the 2022 annual goodwill impairment testing for our other two reporting units indicated that the estimated fair values substantially exceeded their carrying amounts.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESIn addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP), Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures described below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information about the financial performance of the Company, and facilitate meaningful comparison of Schwab’s results in the current period to both historic and future results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. Schwab’s use of non-GAAP measures is reflective of certain adjustments made to GAAP financial measures as described below.Non-GAAP Adjustment or MeasureDefinitionUsefulness to Investors and Uses by Management Acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assetsSchwab adjusts certain GAAP financial measures to exclude the impact of acquisition and integration-related costs incurred as a result of the Company’s acquisitions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and, where applicable, the income tax effect of these expenses. Adjustments made to exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets are reflective of all acquired intangible assets, which were recorded as part of purchase accounting. These acquired intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation. Amortization of acquired intangible assets will continue in future periods over their remaining useful lives.We exclude acquisition and integration-related costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets for the purpose of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe doing so provides additional transparency of Schwab’s ongoing operations, and is useful in both evaluating the operating performance of the business and facilitating comparison of results with prior and future periods. Acquisition and integration-related costs fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and integration activities, thereby limiting comparability of results among periods, and are not representative of the costs of running the Company’s ongoing business. Amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded because management does not believe it is indicative of the Company’s underlying operating performance.Return on tangible common equityReturn on tangible common equity represents annualized adjusted net income available to common stockholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity. Tangible common equity represents common equity less goodwill, acquired intangible assets – net, and related deferred tax liabilities.Acquisitions typically result in the recognition of significant amounts of goodwill and acquired intangible assets. We believe return on tangible common equity may be useful to investors as a supplemental measure to facilitate assessing capital efficiency and returns relative to the composition of Schwab’s balance sheet. The Company also uses adjusted diluted EPS and return on tangible common equity as components of performance criteria for employee bonus and certain executive management incentive compensation arrangements. The Compensation Committee of CSC’s Board of Directors maintains discretion in evaluating performance against these criteria.- 61 -THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATIONManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)The following tables present reconciliations of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures:Year Ended December 31,202220212020Total expenses excluding interest (GAAP)$11,374 $10,807 $7,391 Acquisition and integration-related costs (1)(392)(468)(442)Amortization of acquired intangible assets(596)(615)(190)Adjusted total expenses (non-GAAP)$10,386 $9,724 $6,759 (1) Acquisition and integration-related costs for 2022 primarily consist of $220 million of compensation and benefits, $140 million of professional services, and $21 million of occupancy and equipment.

316709,SCHW,SCHWAB CHARLES CORP,2006,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Management of the Company focuses on several key financial and non-financial metrics in evaluating the Company’s financial position and operating performance. Results for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 are shown in the following table: Growth Rate1-year 2004-2005 2005 2004 2003 Client Activity Metrics: Net new client assets (in billions) 49 % $ 75.0 $ 50.3 $ 56.2 Client assets (in billions, at year end) 11 % $ 1,199.2 $ 1,081.2 $ 966.7 Daily average revenue trades (in thousands) 27 % 197.9 156.4 140.8 Company Financial Metrics: Revenue growth (decline) from prior year 6 % 8 % (1 %) Pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations 26.5 % 15.3 % 18.4 % Return on stockholders’ equity 16 % 6 % 11 % Revenue per average full-time equivalent employee(in thousands) 20 % $ 323 $ 269 $ 245 • Net new client assets is defined as the total inflows of client cash and securities to the firm less client outflows. Management believes that this metric depicts how well the Company’s products and services appeal to new and existing clients. • Client assets is the market value of all client assets housed at the Company. Management considers client assets to be indicative of the Company’s appeal in the marketplace. Additionally, growth in certain components of client assets (e.g., Mutual Fund OneSource funds) directly impacts asset management and administration fee revenues. • Daily average revenue trades (DART) is deemed by management to be an important indicator of client engagement with securities markets and the most prominent driver of trading revenues. • Management believes that revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations, and return on stockholders’ equity provide broad indicators of the Company’s overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns. • Revenue per average full-time equivalent employee (revenue per FTE) is considered by management to be the Company’s broadest measure of productivity. The Company’s revenues are classified into asset-based and other (i.e., asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and other revenue) and trading categories. The Company generates asset-based and other revenues primarily through asset management and administration fees earned through its proprietary and third-party mutual fund offerings, as well as fee-based investment management and advisory services, and interest revenue earned on margin loans, loans to banking clients, and investments. Asset-based and other revenues are impacted by securities valuations, interest rates, the Company’s ability to attract new clients, and client activity levels. The Company generates trading revenues through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenues from trading activity in fixed income securities. Trading revenues are impacted by trading volumes, the volatility of equity prices in the securities markets and commission rates. Energy prices, inflation concerns, and short-term interest rates increased throughout 2005. While overall market returns were mixed for much of the year with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending 1% lower, and the Standard and Poor’s 500 Index and the Nasdaq Composite Index ending up a modest 3% and 1%, respectively, the Company experienced a general improvement in client asset flows and trading volume as the year progressed. - 13 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Following four years of restructuring and cost-cutting efforts, management focused on returning to profitable growth in 2005 by enhancing the Company’s personal service capabilities and developing stronger relationships with clients. Additionally, reflecting a commitment to deliver a value proposition that includes high quality products and services at competitive prices, the Company significantly reduced its commission pricing for a wide range of clients over the course of the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first three quarters of 2005. Schwab also invested for growth by eliminating account service fees (for most accounts) and order handling fees in the fourth quarter of 2005, as well as launching a significant new national advertising campaign. Assets in client accounts were $1.199 trillion at December 31, 2005, up 11% from 2004. Net new client assets brought to the Company totaled $75.0 billion for the year, up 49% from a year ago. Overall, the Company’s price cuts contributed to a 24% decline in trading revenues for 2005, yet continued success in attracting client assets and building stronger client relationships, as well as the rising interest rate environment led to a 16% increase in asset-based and other revenues and total revenue growth of 6%. Expenses decreased by 8% over 2004 levels, primarily due to restructuring charges recorded in 2004 related to the Company’s restructuring initiatives. The Company achieved a significant increase in its pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations due to the combination of higher revenues and lower expenses in 2005. Return on stockholders’ equity grew in 2005 due to both a 153% increase in net income to $725 million (the highest level in the Company’s history) and its capital management activities, including the repurchase of $688 million of common stock. Subsequent Events On January 26, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of CSC’s common stock in addition to the remaining authorization previously granted by the Board of Directors on July 28, 2005. On January 26, 2006, on the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board of Directors elected Marjorie Magner to the Board of Directors to serve as a member of the class of directors whose term expires at the annual meeting of stockholders in 2006. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Growth Rate1-year 2004-2005 2005 2004 2003 Asset-based and other revenues 16 % $ 3,685 $ 3,177 $ 2,706 Trading revenue (24 %) 779 1,025 1,190 Total revenues 6 % 4,464 4,202 3,896 Expenses excluding interest (8 %) 3,279 3,557 3,179 Income from continuing operations before taxes on income 84 % 1,185 645 717 Taxes on income 97 % (455 ) (231 ) (241 ) Income from continuing operations 76 % 730 414 476 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (96 %) (5 ) (128 ) (4 ) Net income 153 % $ 725 $ 286 $ 472 Earnings per share – diluted 162 % $ .55 $ .21 $ .35 Pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations 26.5 % 15.3 % 18.4 % Effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations 38.4 % 35.8 % 33.6 % The increase in asset-based and other revenues from 2004 was primarily due to an increase in asset management and administration fees resulting from higher levels of client assets and an increase in net interest revenue resulting from yields on assets increasing faster than those on liabilities. The decrease in trading revenues from 2004 was primarily due to lower average revenue earned per revenue trade resulting from reductions in the Company’s commission pricing, partially offset by higher client trading activity. - 14 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) The decrease in expenses excluding interest from 2004 was primarily due to lower restructuring charges, occupancy and equipment expense, and communications expense. The increase in the effective income tax rate from 2004 was primarily due to higher state taxes in 2005 and a favorable tax settlement in 2004. The increase in income from continuing operations before taxes on income from 2004 was primarily due to the combination of factors discussed above – higher asset-based and other revenue and lower restructuring charges. The higher income from continuing operations, as well as a lower loss from discontinued operations, resulted in a 153% increase in net income. Effective October 1, 2005, the Company eliminated account service fees (for most accounts) and order-handling fees. Based on the Company’s then-current account base, the impact of these eliminations is approximately $50 million of annualized revenues. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current presentation. All references to EPS information in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition reflect diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. Segment Information The Company evaluates the performance of its segments on a pre-tax basis excluding items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges, discontinued operations, and extraordinary items. As detailed in “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 24. Segment Information,” income from continuing operations before taxes on income was $1.2 billion for 2005, up $540 million, or 84%, from 2004 primarily due to increases of $282 million, or 59%, in the Schwab Investor Services segment; $38 million, or 14%, in the Schwab Institutional segment; $34 million, or 49%, in the U.S. Trust segment; and a $186 million increase in unallocated income from continuing operations. The increase in the Schwab Investor Services segment was primarily due to lower expenses related to the Company’s past restructuring initiatives, as well as growth in asset-based and other revenue, partially offset by lower trading revenue as a result of the Company’s series of commission price reductions. The increase in both the Schwab Institutional and U.S. Trust segments was primarily due to revenue growth outpacing expense growth. The increase in unallocated income from continuing operations was primarily due to the restructuring charges recorded in 2004. Revenues The Company categorizes its revenues as either asset-based and other revenues or trading revenue. As shown in the following table, asset-based and other revenues and total revenues increased, while trading revenue decreased from 2004. - 15 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Sources of Revenues Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate2004-2005 2005 2004 2003 Amount % ofTotalRevenues Amount % ofTotalRevenues Amount % ofTotalRevenues Asset-based and other revenues Asset management and administration fees Mutual fund service fees: Proprietary funds (Schwab Funds®, Excelsior®, and Laudus Funds™) 5 % $ 911 21 % $ 870 21 % $ 883 23 % Mutual Fund OneSource® 19 % 446 10 % 376 9 % 283 7 % Other (3 %) 57 1 % 59 1 % 50 1 % Investment management and trust fees 19 % 645 14 % 542 13 % 379 10 % Other (14 %) 210 5 % 244 6 % 237 6 % Asset management and administration fees 9 % 2,269 51 % 2,091 50 % 1,832 47 % Net interest revenue Interest revenue: Margin loans to clients 44 % 654 15 % 454 11 % 347 9 % Investments, client-related 78 % 522 12 % 293 7 % 284 7 % Loans to banking clients 38 % 380 9 % 275 7 % 230 6 % Securities available for sale 64 % 228 5 % 139 3 % 74 2 % Other 208 % 160 3 % 52 1 % 33 1 % Interest revenue 60 % 1,944 44 % 1,213 29 % 968 25 % Interest expense: Brokerage client cash balances 235 % 378 9 % 113 3 % 76 2 % Deposits from banking clients 112 % 223 5 % 105 3 % 96 3 % Long-term debt 6 % 34 1 % 32 1 % 35 1 % Short-term borrowings 78 % 32 1 % 18 — 13 — Other 122 % 20 — 9 — 20 — Interest expense 148 % 687 16 % 277 7 % 240 6 % Net interest revenue 34 % 1,257 28 % 936 22 % 728 19 % Other 6 % 159 4 % 150 4 % 146 3 % Total asset-based and other revenues 16 % 3,685 83 % 3,177 76 % 2,706 69 % Trading revenue Commissions (26 %) 694 15 % 936 22 % 1,097 29 % Principal transactions (4 %) 85 2 % 89 2 % 93 2 % Total trading revenue (24 %) 779 17 % 1,025 24 % 1,190 31 % Total revenues 6 % $ 4,464 100 % $ 4,202 100 % $ 3,896 100 % - 16 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) While the Schwab Investor Services and Schwab Institutional segments generate both asset-based and other revenues and trading revenues, the U.S. Trust segment generates primarily asset-based and other revenues. Revenues by segment are as shown in the following table: Growth Rate2004-2005 2005 2004 2003 Schwab Investor Services 5 % $ 2,742 $ 2,615 $ 2,517 Schwab Institutional 11 % 803 725 670 U.S. Trust 8 % 832 773 629 Unallocated (2 %) 87 89 80 Total 6 % $ 4,464 $ 4,202 $ 3,896 The increase in revenues in both the Schwab Investor Services and Schwab Institutional segments was primarily due to higher levels of client assets and higher interest rate spreads resulting from the rising interest rate environment. The increase in revenues in the U.S. Trust segment was primarily due to higher levels of client assets. Asset Management and Administration Fees Asset management and administration fees include mutual fund service fees, as well as fees for other asset-based financial services provided to individual and institutional clients. The Company earns mutual fund service fees for transfer agent services, shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. These fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in third-party funds and upon the average daily net assets of the Company’s proprietary funds. Each of the Company’s segments generates mutual fund service fees. The Company also earns asset management and administration fees for financial services provided to individual and institutional clients, including investment management and consulting, trust and fiduciary services, custody services, financial and estate planning, and private banking services. Each of the Company’s segments generates these fees, which are primarily based on the value and composition of assets under management. The increase in asset management and related service fees from 2003 to 2005 was primarily due to higher levels of client assets and higher asset-based fees from certain client relationships, including increases in average assets in Schwab’s Mutual Fund OneSource service. Net Interest Revenue Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on certain assets (mainly margin loans to clients, investments of segregated client cash balances, loans to banking clients, and securities available for sale) and interest paid on supporting liabilities (mainly deposits from banking clients and brokerage client cash balances). Net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and hedging strategies. The Company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall (i.e., interest-earning assets are repricing more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities). In the event of falling interest rates, the Company might attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lock-in asset yields as well as by lowering rates paid to clients on interest-bearing liabilities. Each of the Company’s segments generates net interest revenue. In clearing its clients’ trades, Schwab holds cash balances payable to clients. In most cases, Schwab pays its clients interest on cash balances awaiting investment, and may invest these funds and earn interest revenue. Margin loans arise when Schwab lends funds to clients on a secured basis to purchase securities. Pursuant to SEC regulations, client cash balances that are not used for margin lending are generally segregated into investment accounts that are maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients. When investing segregated client cash balances, Schwab must adhere to SEC regulations that restrict investments to U.S. government securities, participation certificates, mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association, certificates of deposit issued by U.S. banks and thrifts, and resale agreements collateralized by qualified - 17 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) securities. Schwab’s policies for credit quality and maximum maturity requirements are more restrictive than these SEC regulations. In each of the last three years, resale agreements accounted for over 50% of Schwab’s investments of segregated client cash balances. The average maturities of Schwab’s total investments of segregated client cash balances were 155 days for 2005, 148 days for 2004, and 161 days for 2003. U.S. Trust and Schwab Bank also maintain investment portfolios for liquidity as well as to invest funding from deposits raised in excess of loans to clients. U.S. Trust and Schwab Bank lend funds to banking clients primarily in the form of mortgage loans. These loans are largely funded by interest-bearing deposits from banking clients. The Company’s interest-earning assets are financed primarily by interest-bearing brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients. Other funding sources include noninterest-bearing brokerage client cash balances, proceeds from stock-lending activities, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt, as well as stockholders’ equity. Client-related daily average balances, interest rates, and average net interest spread are summarized as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Interest-Earning Assets (client-related and other): Investments (client-related): Average balance outstanding $ 17,007 $ 20,159 $ 21,826 Average interest rate 3.07 % 1.45 % 1.30 % Margin loans to clients: Average balance outstanding $ 9,780 $ 9,074 $ 7,025 Average interest rate 6.69 % 4.99 % 4.94 % Loans to banking clients: Average balance outstanding $ 7,584 $ 6,453 $ 5,034 Average interest rate 5.01 % 4.24 % 4.56 % Securities available for sale: Average balance outstanding $ 5,477 $ 4,031 $ 1,904 Average interest rate 4.16 % 3.45 % 3.91 % Average yield on interest-earning assets 4.48 % 2.94 % 2.62 % Funding Sources (client-related and other): Interest-bearing brokerage client cash balances: Average balance outstanding $ 22,037 $ 23,788 $ 23,140 Average interest rate 1.72 % .47 % .33 % Interest-bearing banking deposits: Average balance outstanding $ 11,628 $ 9,077 $ 5,395 Average interest rate 1.91 % 1.15 % 1.79 % Other interest-bearing sources: Average balance outstanding $ 1,586 $ 2,519 $ 2,843 Average interest rate 2.32 % 1.07 % 1.05 % Average noninterest-bearing portion $ 4,597 $ 4,333 $ 4,411 Average interest rate on funding sources 1.60 % .61 % .57 % Summary: Average yield on interest-earning assets 4.48 % 2.94 % 2.62 % Average interest rate on funding sources 1.60 % .61 % .57 % Average net interest spread 2.88 % 2.33 % 2.05 % The increases in net interest revenue in the last two years were primarily due to higher levels of and changes in the composition of interest-earning assets, including increases in margin loan balances, loans to banking clients, and securities available for sale, as well as generally higher yields on earning assets, partially offset by higher interest rates on brokerage client cash balances due to changes in the interest rate environment. Since the Company establishes the rates paid on brokerage client cash balances and certain banking deposits and the rates charged on margin loans, it manages a substantial portion of its net interest spread. However, the spread is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition. The Company’s average net interest spread increased - 18 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) from 2003 to 2005 as the average yield on interest-earning assets, primarily client-related investments, increased more than the average interest rate on funding sources. Other Revenue Other revenue includes net gains and losses on certain investments, service fees, and software maintenance fees. Each of the Company’s segments generates other revenue. Trading Revenue Trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. The Schwab Investor Services and Schwab Institutional segments generate commission revenues by executing client trades. These revenues are affected by the number of client accounts that trade and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. Principal transaction revenues are primarily comprised of revenues from client fixed income securities trading activity, which are included in the Schwab Investor Services and Schwab Institutional segments. Factors that influence principal transaction revenues include the volume of client trades, market price volatility, and changes in regulations and industry practices. The decrease in trading revenue from 2003 to 2005 was primarily due to lower average revenue earned per revenue trade as a result of significant reductions in commission pricing for a wide range of clients in 2005 and 2004, partially offset by higher daily average revenue trades. As shown in the following table, daily average revenue trades executed by the Company increased 27% in 2005. Average revenue earned per revenue trade decreased 41% from 2004 to 2005, and 23% from 2003 to 2004, primarily due to the pricing changes discussed above.

Variable compensation is tied to the achievement of specified objectives, primarily revenue growth and profit margin. Therefore, a significant portion of compensation and benefits expense will fluctuate with these measures. The increase in compensation and benefits expense from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to higher levels of incentive and variable compensation, partially offset by a reduction in full-time employees through the Company’s 2004 cost reduction effort. The increase in compensation and benefits expense from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to higher levels of discretionary bonuses to employees, employee benefits, and incentive compensation. The following table shows a comparison of certain compensation and benefits components and employee data: Growth Rate2004-2005 2005 2004 2003 Salaries and wages (9 %) $ 1,097 $ 1,199 $ 1,150 Incentive and variable compensation 40 % 526 376 270 Employee benefits and other (8 %) 279 302 245 Total 1 % $ 1,902 $ 1,877 $ 1,665 Full-time equivalent employees (1) (in thousands) At year end (1 %) 14.0 14.2 16.0 Average (12 %) 13.8 15.6 15.9 (1) Includes full-time, part-time and temporary employees, and persons employed on a contract basis. Employee benefits and other expense decreased from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to a reduction in full-time employees through the Company’s past restructuring initiatives. Employee benefits and other expense increased from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to the reinstatement of the Company’s 401(k) employee contribution match, which was suspended in 2003 (except for a discretionary award to certain non-officer employees made in the fourth quarter of 2003). - 20 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) See “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 2. Significant Accounting Policies – New Accounting Standards” for a discussion of future compensation expense related to stock option awards. Expenses Excluding Compensation and Benefits The decreases in occupancy and equipment expense from 2003 to 2005 were primarily due to the Company’s past restructuring initiatives and other expense reduction measures. The increase in professional services expense from 2003 to 2004 were primarily due to higher levels of consulting fees in several areas, including new and expanded products and services, and information technology projects. The increase in advertising and market development expense from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to the Company’s increased print and other media spending. Restructuring During 2001 to 2004, the Company carried out a series of restructuring initiatives which were designed to strengthen its productivity and efficiency and increase profitability. These initiatives included workforce reductions, reductions in operating facilities, the removal of certain systems hardware, software, and equipment from service, and the withdrawal from certain international operations. The Company completed its 2004 cost reduction effort in the first half of 2005. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has recorded facilities restructuring reserves of $169 million, net of estimated future sublease income of approximately $305 million. This estimated future sublease income amount is determined based upon a number of factors, including current and expected commercial real estate lease rates in the respective properties’ real estate markets and estimated vacancy periods prior to execution of tenant subleases. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, approximately 90% and 80%, respectively, of the total square footage targeted for sublease under these restructuring initiatives has been subleased. The actual costs of the remaining restructuring reserves could differ from the estimated costs, depending primarily on the Company’s ability to sublease properties. Discontinued Operations On October 29, 2004, the Company completed the sale of its capital markets business to UBS and thereby eliminated the revenues and expenses unique to the capital markets business, including commissions earned on trades from institutional clients, principal transaction revenues on OTC listed and Nasdaq market-making operations, and commission expense and floor-brokerage expense on institutional client trading activity. In connection with the sale, the Company entered into eight-year order routing and execution services agreements with UBS for handling of Schwab’s equity and listed options order flow. UBS generally executes equity and options orders without commission or other charges. Certain ongoing fees apply for orders that require special handling or entail additional costs, and such fees have been insignificant. The results of operations, net of income taxes, and cash flows of the capital markets business have been presented as discontinued operations on the Company’s consolidated statements of income and of cash flows for all periods. For 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded a loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $5 million and $128 million, respectively. In January 2003, the Company sold its United Kingdom brokerage subsidiary, CSE, to Barclays PLC. The results of operations of CSE, net of income taxes, have been summarized as discontinued operations on the Company’s consolidated statement of income. Divestiture of Investment In June 2003, the Company sold its investment in Aitken Campbell, a market-making joint venture in the U.K., to the Company’s joint venture partner, TD Waterhouse Group, Inc. In 2003, the Company recorded an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of its investment and an income tax benefit. The Company’s share of Aitken Campbell’s historical earnings, which was accounted for under the equity method, was not material to the Company’s results of operations, EPS, or cash flows. - 21 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CSC conducts substantially all of its business through its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The capital structure among CSC and its subsidiaries is designed to provide each entity with capital and liquidity to meet its operational needs and regulatory requirements. CSC is a financial holding company, which is a type of bank holding company subject to supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. CSC and its depository institution subsidiaries, which include U.S. Trust and Schwab Bank, are subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s risk-based and leverage capital guidelines. These regulations require banks and bank holding companies to maintain minimum levels of capital. In addition, CSC’s depository institution subsidiaries are subject to limitations on the amount of dividends they can pay to CSC. Based on their respective regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company and its depository institution subsidiaries are considered well capitalized. Liquidity CSC CSC’s liquidity needs are generally met through cash generated by its subsidiaries, as well as cash provided by external financing. CSC’s depository institution subsidiaries and Schwab are subject to regulatory requirements that may restrict them from certain transactions with CSC. Management believes that funds generated by the operations of CSC’s subsidiaries will continue to be the primary funding source in meeting CSC’s liquidity needs, providing adequate liquidity to meet CSC’s depository institution subsidiaries’ capital guidelines, and maintaining Schwab’s net capital. CSC has liquidity needs that arise from its Senior Medium-Term Notes, Series A (Medium-Term Notes), as well as from the funding of cash dividends, acquisitions, and other investments. The Medium-Term Notes, of which $330 million was issued and outstanding at December 31, 2005, have maturities ranging from 2006 to 2010 and fixed interest rates ranging from 6.21% to 8.05% with interest payable semiannually. The Medium-Term Notes are rated A2 by Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), A- by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group (S&P), and A by Fitch IBCA, Inc. (Fitch). CSC has a prospectus supplement on file with the SEC enabling CSC to issue up to $750 million in Senior or Senior Subordinated Medium-Term Notes, Series A. At December 31, 2005, all of these notes remained unissued. CSC has a Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933 on Form S-3 on file with the SEC relating to a universal shelf registration for the issuance of up to $1.0 billion aggregate amount of various securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, and warrants. At December 31, 2005, all of these securities remained unissued. CSC has authorization from its Board of Directors to issue commercial paper up to the amount of CSC’s committed, unsecured credit facility (see below), not to exceed $1.5 billion. At December 31, 2005, no commercial paper had been issued. CSC’s ratings for these short-term borrowings are P-1 by Moody’s, A-2 by S&P, and F1 by Fitch. CSC maintains an $800 million committed, unsecured credit facility with a group of eighteen banks which is scheduled to expire in June 2006. CSC plans to establish a similar facility to replace this one when it expires. These facilities were unused in 2005. Any issuances under CSC’s commercial paper program will reduce the amount available under this facility. The funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes and CSC pays a commitment fee on the unused balance of this facility. The financial covenants in this facility require CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity, Schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, as defined, and CSC’s depository institution subsidiaries to be well capitalized, as defined. Management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on its ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements. CSC also has direct access to $794 million of the $844 million uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines, provided by eight banks, that are primarily utilized by Schwab to manage short-term liquidity. The amount available to CSC under these lines is - 22 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) lower than the amount available to Schwab because the credit line provided by one of these banks is only available to Schwab. These lines were not used by CSC in 2005. Schwab Most of Schwab’s assets are readily convertible to cash, consisting primarily of short-term (i.e., less than 150 days) investment-grade, interest-earning investments (the majority of which are segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients pursuant to regulatory requirements), receivables from brokerage clients, and receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations. Client margin loans are demand loan obligations secured by readily marketable securities. Receivables from and payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations primarily represent current open transactions, which usually settle, or can be closed out, within a few business days. Liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts, which were $24.2 billion, $27.0 billion, and $25.6 billion at December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for Schwab in the future. The Company has a lease financing liability related to an office building and land under a 20-year lease. The remaining lease financing liability of $130 million at December 31, 2005 is being reduced by a portion of the lease payments over the remaining lease term. To manage short-term liquidity, Schwab maintains uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines with a group of eight banks totaling $844 million at December 31, 2005. The need for short-term borrowings arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements and the scheduled liquidation of interest-bearing investments. Schwab used such borrowings for two days in 2005, with daily amounts borrowed averaging $39 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2005. To satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), Schwab has unsecured letter of credit agreements with eight banks in favor of the OCC aggregating $630 million at December 31, 2005. Schwab pays a fee to maintain these arrangements. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. Schwab satisfies the collateral requirements by arranging letters of credit (LOCs), in favor of these brokerage clients, that are guaranteed by multiple banks. At December 31, 2005, the outstanding value of these LOCs totaled $130 million. No funds were drawn under these LOCs at December 31, 2005. Schwab is subject to regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit Schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings to CSC, paying cash dividends, or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent or employees if such payment would result in net capital of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000. At December 31, 2005, Schwab’s net capital was $1.1 billion (10% of aggregate debit balances), which was $916 million in excess of its minimum required net capital and $576 million in excess of 5% of aggregate debit balances. Schwab has historically targeted net capital to be at least 10% of its aggregate debit balances, which primarily consist of client margin loans. To manage Schwab’s regulatory capital requirement, CSC provides Schwab with a $1.4 billion subordinated revolving credit facility which is scheduled to expire in September 2006. The amount outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2005 was $220 million. Borrowings under this subordinated lending arrangement qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab. U.S. Trust The liquidity needs of U.S. Trust are generally met through deposits from banking clients, equity capital, and borrowings. The excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts is swept into a money market deposit account at U.S. Trust. At December 31, 2005, these balances totaled $711 million. - 23 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) In addition to traditional funding sources such as deposits, federal funds purchased, and repurchase agreements, USTC’s depository institution subsidiaries have established their own external funding sources. At December 31, 2005, U.S. Trust had $52 million in Trust Preferred Capital Securities outstanding with a fixed interest rate of 8.41%. Certain of USTC’s depository institution subsidiaries have established credit facilities with the Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLB) totaling $1.8 billion. At December 31, 2005, $600 million was outstanding under these facilities. Additionally, at December 31, 2005, U.S. Trust had $71 million of federal funds purchased. U.S. Trust also engages in intercompany repurchase agreements with Schwab Bank and Schwab. At December 31, 2005, U.S. Trust had $400 million and $200 million in repurchase agreements outstanding with Schwab Bank and Schwab, respectively. CSC provides U.S. Trust with a $300 million short-term credit facility maturing in December 2006. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for U.S. Trust. The amount outstanding under this facility was $30 million at December 31, 2005. U.S. Trust uses interest rate swap agreements (Swaps) with CSC and third parties to hedge the interest rate risk primarily associated with its variable rate deposits from banking clients. These Swaps are structured for U.S. Trust to receive a variable rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest. At December 31, 2005, the Swaps had a notional value of $1.6 billion and a fair value of $24 million. Schwab Bank Schwab Bank’s current liquidity needs are generally met through deposits from banking clients and equity capital. The excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts is swept into a money market deposit account at Schwab Bank. At December 31, 2005, these balances totaled $5.9 billion. Schwab Bank has access to traditional funding sources such as deposits, federal funds purchased, and repurchase agreements. Additionally, CSC provides Schwab Bank with a $100 million short-term credit facility maturing in December 2007. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab Bank. No funds were drawn under this facility at December 31, 2005. Schwab Bank maintains a credit facility with the FHLB. At December 31, 2005, $433 million was available, and no funds were drawn under this facility. Capital Resources The Company monitors both the relative composition and absolute level of its capital structure. Management is focused on limiting the Company’s use of capital and currently targets a long-term debt to total financial capital ratio of less than 20%. The Company’s total financial capital (long-term debt plus stockholders’ equity) at December 31, 2005 was $5.0 billion, down $7 million from December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2005, the Company had long-term debt of $514 million, or 10% of total financial capital, that bears interest at a weighted-average rate of 7.11%. At December 31, 2004, the Company had long-term debt of $585 million, or 12% of total financial capital. The Company’s cash position (reported as cash and cash equivalents on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet) and cash flows are affected by changes in brokerage client cash balances and the associated amounts required to be segregated under federal or other regulatory guidelines. Timing differences between cash and investments actually segregated on a given date and the amount required to be segregated for that date may arise in the ordinary course of business and are addressed by the Company in accordance with applicable regulations. Other factors which affect the Company’s cash position and cash flows include investment activity in securities, levels of capital expenditures, acquisition activity, banking client deposit activity, brokerage and banking client loan activity, financing activity in short-term borrowings and long-term debt, payments of dividends, and repurchases of CSC’s common stock. The combination of these factors can cause significant fluctuations in the levels of cash and cash equivalents during specific time periods. For example, cash and cash equivalents during the first nine - 24 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) months of 2005 decreased by $889 million, or 32%, to $1.9 billion, but during the full year 2005, cash and cash equivalents decreased by just $448 million, or 16%, to $2.3 billion. In 2005, cash and cash equivalents decreased $448 million, or 16%, to $2.3 billion primarily due to increases in loans to banking clients and securities available for sale, repurchases of common stock, and movements of brokerage client-related funds to meet segregation requirements. These changes were partially offset by increases in deposits from banking clients, primarily related to sweep money market deposit accounts. The excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts is swept into these money market deposit accounts at Schwab Bank or U.S. Trust. At December 31, 2005, these sweep deposit balances totaled $6.6 billion, up $2.0 billion from December 31, 2004. This sweep deposit activity is reflected on the Company’s consolidated statement of cash flows as a cash outflow from payables to brokerage clients (classified as an operating activity) and a cash inflow to deposits from banking clients (classified as a financing activity). The Company’s capital expenditures were $120 million, or $100 million net of proceeds from the sale of fixed assets, in 2005 and $198 million, or $194 million net of proceeds from the sale of fixed assets, in 2004. Capital expenditures, net, as a percentage of revenues totaled 2% and 5% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2005, 85% of capital expenditures were for information technology and 15% for facilities expansion and improvements. Capital expenditures include capitalized costs for developing internal-use software of $45 million in 2005 and $79 million in 2004. Management currently anticipates that 2006 capital expenditures will be approximately 25% higher than 2005 spending. As has been the case in recent years, the Company may adjust its capital expenditures from period to period as business conditions change. Management believes that funds generated by its operations will continue to be the primary funding source of its capital expenditures. Certain cash flows from financing activities by the Company in 2005 include: • Net repayment of $56 million of long-term debt; • Receipt of cash proceeds of $115 million on the exercise of 15 million of the Company’s stock options, with a weighted-average exercise price of $7.99 and a related tax benefit of $27 million; and • Payment of common stock dividends of $116 million. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements The Company enters into various off-balance-sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of its clients. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. Additionally, the Company enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For information on each of these arrangements, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 21. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.” - 25 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Contractual Obligations A summary of the Company’s principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005 is shown in the following table. Excluded from this table are liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet that are generally short-term in nature (e.g., drafts payable and short-term borrowings) or without contractual payment terms (e.g., deposits from banking clients, payables to brokerage clients, and deferred compensation).

Share Repurchases CSC repurchased 56 million shares of its common stock for $688 million in 2005 and 39 million shares of its common stock for $383 million in 2004. On each of April 28 and July 28, 2005, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of CSC’s common stock. The April 28, 2005 authorization has been exhausted. As of December 31, 2005, CSC had authority to repurchase up to $146 million of its common stock. Dividend Policy Since the initial dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 67 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the dividend 16 times, including a 10% and 14% increase in the second and fourth quarters of 2005, respectively. Since 1989, dividends have increased by a 27% compounded annual growth rate. CSC paid common stock dividends of $.089, $.074, and $.050 per share in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, the Company currently targets its cash dividend at approximately 10% to 20% of net income. RISK MANAGEMENT Overview The Company’s business activities expose it to a variety of risks including technology and operations risk, credit, market and liquidity risks, and legal and reputational risk. Identification and management of these risks are essential to the success and financial soundness of the Company. Senior management takes an active role in the Company’s risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling various risks. Oversight of risk management has been delegated to the Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior managers of major business and control functions. The Global Risk Committee is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the Company’s risk exposures, and leading the continued development of the Company’s risk management policies and practices. - 26 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report into the Global Risk Committee. These sub-committees include: • Corporate Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee, which focuses on the Company’s liquidity, capital resources, and interest rate risk; • Credit and Market Risk Oversight Committee, which focuses on the credit exposures resulting from client activity (e.g., margin lending activities and loans to banking clients), the investing activities of certain of the Company’s proprietary funds, corporate credit activities (e.g., counterparty and corporate investing activities), and market risk resulting from the Company taking positions in certain securities to facilitate client trading activity; • Technology and Operations Risk Committee, which focuses on the integrity of controls and operating capacity of the Company’s systems and operations processes; • Fiduciary Risk Committee, which oversees activities of the Company with a fiduciary component; and • New Products Committee, which addresses risks associated with new products and services. The Global Risk Committee reports regularly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Audit Committee), which reviews major risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The Company’s Disclosure Committee is responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s (a) disclosure controls and procedures and (b) internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Additionally, the Company’s compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and risk and credit management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring the Company’s risk management. Risk is inherent in the Company’s business. Consequently, despite the Company’s efforts to identify areas of risk, oversee operational areas involving risk, and implement policies and procedures designed to mitigate risk, there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer unexpected losses due to operating or other risks. The following discussion highlights the Company’s policies and procedures for identification, assessment, and mitigation of the principal areas of risk in its operations. Technology and Operating Risk Technology and operating risk is the potential for loss due to deficiencies in control processes or technology systems that constrain the Company’s ability to gather, process and communicate information efficiently and securely, without interruptions. The Company’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and the Company’s success depends, in part, on its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its technology in anticipation of evolving client needs. To the extent the Company experiences system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to its systems, linkages with third-party systems, and power failures), the Company’s business and operations could be significantly negatively impacted. Additionally, rapid increases in client demand may strain the Company’s ability to enhance its technology and expand its operating capacity. To minimize business interruptions, Schwab has two data centers intended, in part, to further improve the recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency. The Company is committed to an ongoing process of upgrading, enhancing, and testing its technology systems. This effort is focused on meeting client needs, meeting market and regulatory changes, and deploying standardized technology platforms. Technology and operating risk also includes the risk of human error, employee misconduct, external fraud, computer viruses, terrorist attack, and natural disaster. Employee misconduct could include fraud and misappropriation of client or Company assets, improper use or disclosure of confidential client or Company information, and unauthorized activities, such as transactions exceeding acceptable risks or authorized limits. External fraud includes misappropriation of client or Company assets by third parties, including through unauthorized access to Company systems and data and client accounts. The frequency and sophistication of such fraud attempts continue to increase. - 27 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) The Company has specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and uses periodic risk self-assessments and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The Company maintains backup and recovery functions, including facilities for backup and communications, and conducts periodic testing of disaster recovery plans. The Company also maintains policies and procedures and technology to protect against fraud and unauthorized access to systems and data. Despite the Company’s risk mitigation efforts, it is not always possible to deter or prevent technological or operational failure, or fraud or other misconduct, and the precautions taken by the Company may not be effective in all cases. The Company may be subject to litigation, losses, and regulatory actions in such cases, and may be required to expend significant additional resources to remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures. The Company also faces technology and operating risk when it employs the services of various external vendors, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, and support functions. The Company manages its exposure to such outsourcing risks through contractual agreements and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance. The Company is actively engaged in the research and development of new technologies, services, and products. The Company endeavors to protect its research and development efforts, and its brands, through the use of copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and contracts. From time to time, the Company may be subject to litigation claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights (e.g., patents). Such litigation can require the expenditure of significant Company resources. If the Company were found to have infringed a third-party patent, or other intellectual property rights, it could incur substantial liability, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology, or providing certain products or services. Credit Risk Credit risk is the potential for loss due to a client or counterparty failing to perform its contractual obligations, or the value of collateral held to secure obligations proving to be inadequate. The Company’s direct exposure to credit risk mainly results from margin lending activities, securities lending activities, its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities, and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the Company’s proprietary funds. To mitigate the risks of such losses, the Company has established policies and procedures which include: establishing and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin requirements for certain securities. In addition, most of the Company’s credit extensions, such as margin loans to clients, securities lending agreements, and resale agreements, are supported by collateral arrangements. These arrangements are subject to requirements to provide additional collateral in the event that market fluctuations result in declines in the value of collateral received. Additionally, the Company has exposure to credit risk associated with the Company’s banking loan portfolios held at U.S. Trust and Schwab Bank. This client credit exposure is actively managed through individual and portfolio reviews performed by account officers and senior line management. Periodic assessment of the validity of credit ratings, credit quality and the credit management process is conducted by a credit review department which is separate from the loan origination and monitoring department. Management regularly reviews asset quality including concentrations, delinquencies, non-performing loans to banking clients, losses, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses, which is reviewed quarterly by senior management. Schwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab’s client or a counterparty fails to meet its obligations to Schwab. Fiduciary Risk Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through the breaching of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. The Company attempts to mitigate this risk by establishing procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the - 28 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) primary responsibility for adherence to the procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various fiduciary risk committees. Legal and Regulatory Risk The Company faces significant legal and compliance risk in its business, and the volume of litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services firms and the amount of damages claimed have been increasing. Among other things, these risks relate to the suitability of client investments, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for Company products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of the Company’s controls. Claims against the Company may increase due to a variety of factors, such as if clients suffer losses during a period of deteriorating equity market conditions, as the Company increases the level of advice it provides to clients, and as the Company enhances the services it provides to IAs. In addition, the Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, and SROs, and such regulation is becoming increasingly extensive and complex. The Company attempts to mitigate legal and compliance risk through policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid litigation claims and prevent or detect violations of applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, client privacy, employment policies, and contracts management. Despite the Company’s efforts to maintain an effective compliance program and internal controls, legal breaches and rule violations, even if unintentional, could result in reputational harm, significant losses and disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on the Company’s business activities. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. While the majority of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain critical accounting policies that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position and reported financial results. These critical accounting policies are described below. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy. Valuation of Goodwill: Under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually, or whenever indications of impairment exist. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, resulting in an impairment charge for this excess. The Company has elected April 1 as its annual goodwill impairment testing date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on April 1, 2005, management estimated the fair value of each of the Company’s reporting units (generally defined as the Company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) and compared this value to the carrying value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit was greater than its carrying value, and therefore management concluded that no amount of goodwill was impaired. The estimated fair value of the reporting units was established using a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit. Adverse changes in the Company’s planned business operations such as unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit, or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the Company’s recorded goodwill. The Company’s goodwill balances, net of accumulated amortization, were $809 million and $811 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in goodwill in 2005 was primarily due to a purchase price adjustment related to U.S. Trust’s acquisition of State Street Corporation’s Private Asset Management group in 2003. Valuation and Estimated Useful Lives of Intangible Assets Other than Goodwill: The Company’s intangible assets represent purchased assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill, principally the value of client relationships. Management generally obtains independent valuations to estimate the initial valuation and expected amortization - 29 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) period for client-related intangible assets. These valuations are primarily based on the present value of the estimated net cash flows expected to be derived from the client relationships, and assumptions about future client attrition. At each balance sheet date, management compares the actual and estimated attrition for client-related intangible assets to evaluate whether revisions to the amortization period are necessary. Also, management evaluates the client-related intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Therefore, higher than expected client attrition may result in higher future amortization charges or an impairment charge for client-related intangible assets. The Company’s intangible asset balances, net of accumulated amortization, were $143 million and $153 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Restructuring Reserves: A portion of the reserves under the Company’s restructuring initiatives are based on assumptions, including the Company’s ability to successfully sublease certain real estate properties. The initial restructuring reserves and any subsequent changes in estimates of such reserves are recorded in restructuring charges on the Company’s consolidated statement of income. Factors and uncertainties which may adversely affect the estimates of sublease income include deterioration in the respective properties’ real estate markets, prolonged vacancy periods prior to execution of tenant subleases, and subtenant default. The Company’s total facilities reserves related to its restructuring initiatives were $169 million and $248 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits: Under U.S. Trust’s trusteed, noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan, the benefit obligation and related plan assets are based on certain estimates – years of employee service, rate of increase in salary, discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets – which are made by management with recommendations by actuaries. In addition to the years of employee service, rate of increase in salary, and discount rate, U.S. Trust’s postretirement medical and life insurance benefit obligation is based on the health care cost trend rate, which is an actuarial estimated rate of future increases in per capita cost of health care benefits. The Company’s pension benefit obligation was $335 million and $312 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The related pension expense is included in compensation and benefits on the Company’s consolidated statement of income and was $6 million, $7 million, and $8 million for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities: As part of its asset and liability management process, the Company uses Swaps to manage interest rate risk. U.S. Trust uses LIBOR-based Swaps to hedge the interest rate risk associated with its variable-rate deposits from banking clients and short-term borrowings. The Company has designated these Swaps as cash flow hedges, as allowed by SFAS No. 133 – Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Therefore, principally all of the cumulative change in the fair value of these Swaps from inception, totaling a net $14 million asset and $6 million liability at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is a component of stockholders’ equity that is not recognized in current earnings. Any actual hedge ineffectiveness, which was immaterial for 2005, 2004, and 2003, is recorded in interest expense on the Company’s consolidated statement of income. In order to maintain hedge accounting treatment, management performs a quarterly assessment of its expectation that these Swaps are effective in achieving the desired hedging results. Additionally, the Company has entered into Swaps that effectively convert the interest rate characteristics of a portion of the Company’s Medium-Term Notes from fixed to variable. The Company has designated such Swaps as fair value hedges, as allowed by SFAS No. 133. Since the notional amount, fixed interest rate, and maturity of these Swaps exactly match the terms of the corresponding Medium-Term Notes, the Company has concluded that these Swaps are completely effective in achieving the desired hedging results, as permitted under SFAS No. 133. Consequently, changes in the fair value of these Swaps, totaling an aggregate $2 million and $13 million asset at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, are completely offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged Medium-Term Notes. Accordingly, there has not been any impact on earnings as a result of this hedging program except for the conversion from a fixed to a floating rate of interest on a portion of the Medium-Term Notes. Allowance for Credit Losses: The Company regularly evaluates its portfolio of loans to banking clients and provides allowances for the portion management believes may be uncollectible. Several factors are taken into consideration in this evaluation including current economic conditions, the composition of the loan portfolio, past loss experience, and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. For Schwab Bank and U.S. Trust portfolios, which primarily consist of mortgage loans, a risk- - 30 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) based methodology is used to determine the allowance for credit losses. Mortgage loans are categorized into portfolios by loan type and risk characteristics. A probable loss rate, based on company and industry experience, is used to determine the credit allowance for each portfolio of loans. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company’s allowance for credit losses was $29 million and $27 million on loan portfolios of $8.5 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively. Legal Reserve: The Company is subject to legal, regulatory and other proceedings and claims arising from the conduct of its business. The Company establishes a reserve for potential losses that may arise out of these proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated. The amount of the reserve, which is determined on a case-by-case basis, represents the Company’s best estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, experience in similar cases, available defenses, insurance coverage, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. However, significant judgment is required in making this estimate and the actual cost of resolving a claim may be higher or lower than the amount of the recorded reserve. Stock-based compensation: The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25 – Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations, for its stock-based employee compensation plans. Because the Company grants stock option awards at an exercise price not less than market value, there is no compensation expense recorded when the awards are granted. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company will account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R – Share-Based Payment. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term of stock options, the expected volatility of the Company’s common stock, and expected dividends. Significant changes in these assumptions for future awards could materially impact stock-based compensation expense and the Company’s results of operations. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the Company’s results of operations could be impacted. See “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 2. Significant Accounting Policies – New Accounting Standards” for a discussion of future compensation expense related to stock option awards, including unvested stock options outstanding at December 31, 2005. Long-term incentive compensation: Eligible officers may receive cash long-term incentive plan units under a long-term incentive plan (LTIP). These awards are restricted from transfer or sale and generally vest over a three- to four-year period. Each award provides for a one-time cash payment for an amount that varies based upon the Company’s cumulative EPS over the respective performance period of each grant, generally three to four years. The Company accrues the estimated total cost for each grant on a straight-line basis over each LTIP’s vesting period, with periodic cumulative adjustments to expense as estimates of the total grant cost are revised. The estimated total cost of each grant will vary based upon changes in estimated and actual cumulative EPS amounts over each LTIP’s performance period. Grants were issued under this LTIP in 2003, 2004, and 2005 with performance periods ending December 31, 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. The LTIP liability was $61 million and $24 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The LTIP expense, included in compensation and benefits expense on the Company’s consolidated statement of income, was $37 million, $15 million, and $9 million for the years 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The Company’s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee. Additionally, management has reviewed with the Audit Committee the Company’s significant estimates discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

Certain of these factors, as well as general risk factors affecting the Company, are discussed in greater detail in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Item 1A – Risk Factors.” - 32 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential for loss due to a change in the value of a financial instrument held by the Company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, or currency exchange rates. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interest-earning assets (mainly margin loans to clients, investments, loans to banking clients, mortgage-backed securities, and other fixed-rate investments) and its funding sources (including brokerage client cash balances, banking deposits, proceeds from stock-lending activities, and long-term debt) which finance these assets. To mitigate the risk of loss, the Company has established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk, and by monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interest-earning assets and funding sources. The Company also has the ability to adjust the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and certain banking deposits and the rates charged on margin loans. Additionally, the Company uses Swaps to mitigate interest rate exposure associated with short-term floating interest-rate deposits. The Company’s exposure to equity price and currency exchange risks is not material. Financial Instruments Held For Trading Purposes The Company holds fixed income securities, which include municipal and government securities, and corporate bonds, in inventory to meet clients’ trading needs. The fair value of such inventory was approximately $74 million and $54 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These securities, and the associated interest rate risk, are not material to the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Financial Instruments Held For Purposes Other Than Trading Debt Issuances At December 31, 2005, CSC had $330 million aggregate principal amount of Medium-Term Notes outstanding, with fixed interest rates ranging from 6.21% to 8.05%. At December 31, 2004, CSC had $386 million aggregate principal amount of Medium-Term Notes outstanding, with fixed interest rates ranging from 6.21% to 8.05%. At both December 31, 2005 and 2004, U.S. Trust had $52 million Trust Preferred Capital Securities outstanding, with a fixed interest rate of 8.41%. The Company has fixed cash flow requirements regarding these long-term debt obligations due to the fixed rate of interest. The fair value of these obligations at December 31, 2005 and 2004, based on estimates of market rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities, was $407 million and $485 million, respectively, compared to their carrying amounts of $384 million and $451 million, respectively. Interest Rate Swaps As part of its consolidated asset and liability management process, the Company utilizes Swaps to manage interest rate risk. For a discussion of such Swaps, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 22. Financial Instruments Subject to Off-Balance Sheet Risk, Credit Risk or Market Risk.” Forward Sale and Interest Rate Lock Commitments For a discussion of Schwab Bank’s forward sale and interest rate lock commitments related to its loans held for sale portfolio, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 22. Financial Instruments Subject to Off-Balance Sheet Risk, Credit Risk or Market Risk.” - 33 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Net Interest Revenue Simulation The Company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulation model (the model) includes all interest-sensitive assets and liabilities, as well as Swaps utilized by the Company to hedge its interest rate risk. Key variables in the model include assumed balance growth or decline for client loans, deposits, brokerage client cash, changes in the level and term structure of interest rates, the repricing of financial instruments, prepayment and reinvestment assumptions, and product pricing assumptions. The simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies, including changes in asset and liability mix. As demonstrated by the simulations presented below, the Company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall (i.e., interest-earning assets are repricing more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities). The simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As the Company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood the Company would take steps to manage any additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment. The following table shows the results of a gradual 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates relative to the Company’s current base rate forecast on simulated net interest revenue over the next twelve months at December 31, 2005 and 2004. December 31, 2005 2004 Increase of 200 basis points 5.2% 5.7% Decrease of 200 basis points (5.7%) (5.9%) While the simulations show a reduction in exposure to rate changes at December 31, 2005 from December 31, 2004, the Company remains positioned to experience increases in net interest revenue as rates rise and decreases as rates fall. - 34 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, and as Noted)",2023-12-30 18:56:44.178365
316709,SCHW,SCHWAB CHARLES CORP,2007,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Management of the Company focuses on several key financial and non-financial metrics in evaluating the Company’s financial position and operating performance. All information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is presented on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted. Results for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 are shown in the following table: Growth Rate1-year 2005-2006 2006 2005 2004 Client Activity Metrics: Net new client assets (in billions) 4 % $ 72.2 $ 69.5 $ 48.8 Client assets (in billions, at year end) 18 % $ 1,239.2 $ 1,053.5 $ 942.0 Daily average revenue trades (in thousands) 18 % 234.4 197.9 156.4 Company Financial Metrics: Net revenue growth from prior year 19 % 6 % 5 % Pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations 34.3 % 28.4 % 16.0 % Return on stockholders’ equity 26 % 16 % 6 % Net revenue per average full-time equivalent employee (in thousands) 13 % $ 362 $ 319 $ 260 • Net new client assets is defined as the total inflows of client cash and securities to the firm less client outflows. Management believes that this metric depicts how well the Company’s products and services appeal to new and existing clients. • Client assets is the market value of all client assets housed at the Company. Management considers client assets to be indicative of the Company’s appeal in the marketplace. Additionally, growth in certain components of client assets (e.g., Mutual Fund OneSource funds) directly impacts asset management and administration fee revenues. • Daily average revenue trades (DART) is an important indicator of client engagement with securities markets and the most prominent driver of trading revenues. • Management believes that net revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations, and return on stockholders’ equity provide broad indicators of the Company’s overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns. • Net revenue per average full-time equivalent employee is considered by management to be the Company’s broadest measure of productivity. The Company’s net revenues are classified into asset-based and other (i.e., asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and other revenue) and trading categories. The Company generates asset-based and other revenues primarily through asset management and administration fees earned through its proprietary and third-party mutual fund offerings, as well as fee-based investment management and advisory services, and interest revenue earned on margin loans, loans to banking clients, and investments. Asset-based and other revenues are impacted by securities valuations, interest rates, the Company’s ability to attract new clients, and client activity levels. The Company generates trading revenues through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenues from trading activity in fixed income securities. Trading revenues are impacted by trading volumes, the volatility of equity prices in the securities markets and commission rates. - 15 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) During 2006, interest rates stabilized and the S&P 500 Index and Nasdaq Composite Index marked their fourth consecutive year of gains. Overall market returns for the year showed double-digit gains for the three major indices – the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 16%, the Standard and Poor’s 500 Index increased 14%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index increased 10%. Coupled with the strong market returns in 2006, the Company experienced a general improvement in client asset flows and trading volume as the year progressed. The Company strengthened its operating and financial performance in 2006 by focusing on significantly improving the client experience in each of its two segments. Additionally, reflecting a commitment to deliver a value proposition that includes high quality products and services at competitive prices, the Company reduced its commission pricing for a wide range of clients and eliminated certain fees in 2006. Assets in client accounts were $1.239 trillion at December 31, 2006, up 18% from 2005. Net new client assets in the Schwab Investor Services and Schwab Institutional segments totaled $87.3 billion for the year, up 33% from a year ago. Overall, the Company’s success in attracting client assets and building stronger client relationships, as well as the interest rate environment and improved market performance, led to a 24% increase in asset-based and other revenues and total net revenue growth of 19%. Expenses increased by 9% over 2005 levels, primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense, professional services expense, and advertising and market development expense. The Company achieved an increase in its pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations due to revenue growth outpacing expense growth in 2006. Return on stockholders’ equity grew in 2006 due to both a 69% increase in net income to $1.2 billion (the highest level in the Company’s history) and its capital management activities, including the repurchase of $859 million of common stock. Discontinued Operations On November 19, 2006, CSC entered into a definitive agreement with Bank of America pursuant to which Bank of America will acquire all of the outstanding common stock of U.S. Trust for $3.3 billion in cash. The transaction is expected to close early in the third quarter of 2007. However, the closing is subject to (i) approval of new investment advisor agreements for each of the Excelsior® mutual funds by the applicable public fund board and the stockholders of each fund, (ii) regulatory approvals, and (iii) other customary closing conditions. The Company estimates it will record a pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $1.9 billion. After-tax proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and continued investment in Schwab Investor Services, Schwab Institutional, and Schwab Bank. U.S. Trust comprised all of the previously-reported U.S. Trust segment. In 2006, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $205 million related to the estimated difference between the tax and book bases of the Company’s U.S. Trust stock. This amount is included in income from discontinued operations, net of tax on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. When calculating the Company’s gain on the sale of U.S. Trust for income tax purposes, the tax basis will be the basis of U.S. Trust’s prior stockholders in their shares as of the date U.S. Trust was acquired by the Company, since the transaction qualified as a tax-free exchange. This tax benefit is management’s current estimate and is based on publicly available information, including information on the composition of U.S. Trust’s stockholders at the acquisition date and the market price of U.S. Trust stock during relevant periods. The final amount of the basis difference, which could differ from management’s estimate, will be determined following a survey of former U.S. Trust stockholders that the Company expects to complete in mid-2007. The results of operations, net of income taxes, and cash flows of U.S. Trust have been presented as discontinued operations on the Company’s consolidated statements of income and of cash flows, respectively, and the assets and liabilities of U.S. Trust have been combined and presented as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s consolidated prior period revenues, expenses, taxes on income, assets, liabilities, and cash flows also reflect this presentation. - 16 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) On October 29, 2004, the Company sold its capital markets business to UBS and thereby eliminated the revenues and expenses unique to the capital markets business. The results of operations, net of income taxes, and cash flows of the capital markets business have been presented as discontinued operations on the Company’s consolidated statements of income and of cash flows for all periods. 2006 2005 2004 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax: Pending sale of U.S. Trust $ 333 $ 96 $ 64 Sale of capital markets business 3 (5 ) (128 ) Total $ 336 $ 91 $ (64 ) Subsequent Events On January 24, 2007, Christopher V. Dodds, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CSC, announced his decision to retire as the Chief Financial Officer of CSC on May 18, 2007. The Board of Directors named Joseph R. Martinetto, Senior Vice President and Treasurer of CSC and Schwab, to replace Mr. Dodds as Chief Financial Officer of CSC effective upon Mr. Dodds’ retirement on May 18, 2007. On February 20, 2007, the Board of Directors appointed Walter W. Bettinger II as President and Chief Operating Officer of CSC. Mr. Bettinger had been serving as Executive Vice President and President-Schwab Investor Services. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Growth Rate1-year 2005-2006 2006 2005 2004 Asset-based and other revenues 24 % $ 3,524 $ 2,841 $ 2,393 Trading revenue 1 % 785 778 1,023 Total net revenues 19 % 4,309 3,619 3,416 Expenses excluding interest 9 % 2,833 2,592 2,869 Income from continuing operations before taxes on income 44 % 1,476 1,027 547 Taxes on income 49 % (585 ) (393 ) (197 ) Income from continuing operations 41 % 891 634 350 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax n/m 336 91 (64 ) Net income 69 % $ 1,227 $ 725 $ 286 Earnings per share – diluted 73 % $ .95 $ .55 $ .21 Pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations 34.3 % 28.4 % 16.0 % Effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations 39.6 % 38.3 % 36.0 % n/m Not meaningful. The increase in asset-based and other revenues from 2005 was primarily due to an increase in asset management and administration fees resulting from higher levels of client assets and an increase in net interest revenue resulting from yields on assets increasing faster than those on liabilities. The increase in trading revenues from 2005 was primarily due to higher client trading activity, partially offset by lower average revenue earned per revenue trade resulting from reductions in the Company’s commission pricing, which were effective in the third quarter of 2006. - 17 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) The increase in expenses excluding interest from 2005 was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense, professional services expense, and advertising and market development expense. The increases in the effective income tax rates from 2004 to 2006 were primarily due to higher state taxes. The increase in income from continuing operations before taxes on income from 2005 was primarily due to higher asset-based and other revenues. The higher income from continuing operations, combined with the income from discontinued operations, resulted in a 69% increase in net income. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current presentation. All references to EPS information in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reflect diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. Segment Information The Company evaluates the performance of its segments on a pre-tax basis excluding items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges, discontinued operations, and extraordinary items. As detailed in “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 21. Segment Information,” income from continuing operations before taxes on income was $1.5 billion for 2006, up $449 million, or 44%, from 2005 primarily due to increases of $278 million, or 37%, in the Schwab Investor Services segment; $87 million, or 27%, in the Schwab Institutional segment; and an $84 million increase in unallocated and other income from continuing operations. The increases in the Schwab Investor Services and Schwab Institutional segments were primarily due to growth in net interest revenue and higher asset management and administrative fees combined with expense growth that was lower than revenue growth. The increase in unallocated and other income from continuing operations was primarily due to the receipt of $25 million related to the confidential resolution of a legal matter in 2006 and restructuring charges recorded in 2005. Net Revenues The Company categorizes its revenues as either asset-based and other revenues or trading revenue. As shown in the following table, asset-based and other revenues, trading revenue, and total net revenues increased from 2005. - 18 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Sources of Net Revenues Year Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Growth Rate2005-2006 Amount % ofTotal NetRevenues Amount % ofTotal NetRevenues Amount % ofTotal NetRevenues Asset-based and other revenues Asset management and administration fees Mutual fund service fees: Proprietary funds (Schwab Funds® and Laudus FundsTM) 15 % $ 930 22 % $ 807 22 % $ 794 23 % Mutual Fund OneSource® 17 % 523 12 % 447 12 % 380 11 % Other 13 % 63 2 % 56 2 % 54 2 % Investment management and trust fees 34 % 296 7 % 221 6 % 149 4 % Other (7 %) 133 3 % 143 4 % 172 5 % Asset management and administration fees 16 % 1,945 46 % 1,674 46 % 1,549 45 % Net interest revenue Interest revenue: Margin loans to clients 28 % 837 19 % 654 18 % 454 13 % Investments, client-related 17 % 609 14 % 522 14 % 293 9 % Securities available for sale 149 % 319 8 % 128 4 % 62 2 % Loans to banking clients 64 % 128 3 % 78 2 % 25 1 % Other 56 % 220 5 % 141 4 % 43 1 % Interest revenue 39 % 2,113 49 % 1,523 42 % 877 26 % Interest expense: Brokerage client cash balances 13 % 426 10 % 378 10 % 113 3 % Deposits from banking clients 170 % 200 5 % 74 2 % 21 1 % Long-term debt (3 %) 29 1 % 30 1 % 28 1 % Other 26 % 24 — 19 1 % 10 — Interest expense 36 % 679 16 % 501 14 % 172 5 % Net interest revenue 40 % 1,434 33 % 1,022 28 % 705 21 % Other — 145 3 % 145 5 % 139 4 % Total asset-based and other revenues 24 % 3,524 82 % 2,841 79 % 2,393 70 % Trading revenue Commissions 1 % 703 16 % 693 19 % 934 27 % Principal transactions (4 %) 82 2 % 85 2 % 89 3 % Total trading revenue 1 % 785 18 % 778 21 % 1,023 30 % Total net revenues 19 % $ 4,309 100 % $ 3,619 100 % $ 3,416 100 % - 19 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Schwab Investor Services and Schwab Institutional segments generate both asset-based and other revenues and trading revenues. Net revenues by segment are as shown in the following table: Growth Rate2005-2006 2006 2005 2004 Schwab Investor Services 18 % $ 3,239 $ 2,742 $ 2,615 Schwab Institutional 20 % 966 803 725 Unallocated and other 41 % 104 74 76 Total net revenues 19 % $ 4,309 $ 3,619 $ 3,416 The increase in net revenues in both the Schwab Investor Services and Schwab Institutional segments was primarily due to higher levels of client assets and higher interest rate spreads. The increase in unallocated and other income from continuing operations was primarily due to the receipt of $25 million related to the confidential resolution of a legal matter in 2006. Asset Management and Administration Fees Asset management and administration fees include mutual fund service fees, as well as fees for other asset-based financial services provided to individual and institutional clients. The Company earns mutual fund service fees for transfer agent services, shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. These fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in third-party funds and upon the average daily net assets of the Company’s proprietary funds. The Company also earns asset management and administration fees for financial services provided to individual and institutional clients, including trust and custody services. The increase in asset management and related service fees from 2004 to 2006 was primarily due to higher levels of client assets in the Company’s proprietary mutual funds and higher volumes of asset-based fees from certain client relationships, including increases in average assets in Schwab’s Mutual Fund OneSource service. Net Interest Revenue Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on certain assets (mainly margin loans to clients, investments of segregated client cash balances, loans to banking clients, and securities available for sale) and interest paid on supporting liabilities (mainly deposits from banking clients and brokerage client cash balances). Net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies. The Company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall (i.e., interest-earning assets reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities). In the event of falling interest rates, the Company might attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lock-in asset yields as well as by lowering rates paid to clients on interest-bearing liabilities. In clearing its clients’ trades, Schwab holds cash balances payable to clients. In most cases, Schwab pays its clients interest on cash balances awaiting investment, and may invest these funds and earn interest revenue. Margin loans arise when Schwab lends funds to clients on a secured basis to purchase securities. Pursuant to SEC regulations, client cash balances that are not used for margin lending are generally segregated into investment accounts that are maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients. When investing segregated client cash balances, Schwab must adhere to SEC regulations that restrict investments to U.S. government securities, participation certificates, mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association, certificates of deposit issued by U.S. banks and thrifts, and resale agreements - 20 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) collateralized by qualified securities. Schwab’s policies for credit quality and maximum maturity requirements are more restrictive than these SEC regulations. Schwab Bank also maintains investment portfolios for liquidity as well as to invest funding from deposits raised in excess of loans to clients. Schwab Bank invests in securities available for sale, including commercial paper, collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate debt, and U.S. government securities. Schwab Bank lends funds to banking clients primarily in the form of mortgage loans. These loans are largely funded by interest-bearing deposits from banking clients. The Company’s interest-earning assets are financed primarily by interest-bearing brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients. Other funding sources include noninterest-bearing brokerage client cash balances, proceeds from stock-lending activities, and long-term debt, as well as stockholders’ equity. Client-related daily average balances, interest rates, and average net interest spread are summarized as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Interest-Earning Assets (client-related and other): Investments (client-related): Average balance outstanding $ 12,758 $ 17,007 $ 20,159 Average interest rate 4.77 % 3.07 % 1.45 % Margin loans to clients: Average balance outstanding $ 10,252 $ 9,780 $ 9,074 Average interest rate 8.17 % 6.69 % 4.99 % Securities available for sale: Average balance outstanding (1) $ 6,090 $ 3,363 $ 2,487 Average interest rate 5.23 % 3.81 % 2.48 % Loans to banking clients: Average balance outstanding $ 2,162 $ 1,613 $ 733 Average interest rate 5.94 % 4.84 % 3.45 % Average yield on interest-earning assets 6.06 % 4.35 % 2.60 % Funding Sources (client-related and other): Interest-bearing brokerage client cash balances: Average balance outstanding $ 17,865 $ 22,037 $ 23,788 Average interest rate 2.38 % 1.72 % .47 % Interest-bearing banking deposits: Average balance outstanding (1) $ 9,137 $ 5,597 $ 3,748 Average interest rate 2.19 % 1.32 % .55 % Other interest-bearing sources: Average balance outstanding $ 1,816 $ 1,585 $ 2,518 Average interest rate 2.42 % 2.32 % 1.07 % Average noninterest-bearing portion $ 2,444 $ 2,544 $ 2,399 Average interest rate on funding sources 2.14 % 1.54 % .49 % Summary: Average yield on interest-earning assets 6.06 % 4.35 % 2.60 % Average interest rate on funding sources 2.14 % 1.54 % .49 % Average net interest spread 3.92 % 2.81 % 2.11 % (1) Includes assets and liabilities retained from discontinued operations as discussed below. The increases in net interest revenue in the last two years were primarily due to changes in the composition of interest-earning assets, including increases in securities available for sale, loans to banking clients, and margin loan balances, as well as generally higher yields on earning assets, partially offset by higher interest rates on banking deposits. - 21 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Since the Company establishes the rates paid on brokerage client cash balances and certain banking deposits and the rates charged on margin loans, it manages a substantial portion of its net interest spread. However, the spread is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition. The Company’s average net interest spread increased from 2004 to 2006 as the average yield on interest-earning assets, primarily client-related investments, increased more than the average interest rate on funding sources. Certain interest-bearing assets and liabilities of U.S. Trust to be retained by the Company: The excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts is swept into a money market deposit account at U.S. Trust. In 2007, Schwab will terminate this arrangement prior to the closing of the sale of U.S. Trust and move these balances to a similar existing arrangement with Schwab Bank. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, these balances totaled $749 million and $711 million, respectively, and are included in deposits from banking clients with a corresponding amount in assets retained from discontinued operations on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The interest expense related to these client deposit balances is included in interest expense from continuing operations on the Company’s consolidated statements of income of $11 million, $6 million, and $2 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The corresponding interest revenue on the invested cash balances related to these deposits is included in interest revenue from continuing operations on the Company’s consolidated statements of income of $38 million, $22 million, and $6 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The interest revenue amount is calculated using the Company’s funds transfer pricing methodology. Other Revenue Other revenue generally includes net gains and losses on certain investments, service fees, and software maintenance fees. Trading Revenue Trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenues are affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. Principal transaction revenues are primarily comprised of revenues from client fixed income securities trading activity. Factors that influence principal transaction revenues include the volume of client trades, market price volatility, and changes in regulations and industry practices. The increase in trading revenue from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades, partially offset by lower average revenue earned per revenue trade as a result of reductions in commission pricing in 2006 and 2005. The decrease in trading revenue from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to lower average revenue earned per revenue trade as a result of reductions in commission pricing for a wide range of clients in 2005 and 2004, partially offset by higher daily average revenue trades. As shown in the following table, daily average revenue trades executed by the Company increased 18% in 2006. Average revenue earned per revenue trade decreased 14% from 2005 to 2006, and 41% from 2004 to 2005, primarily due to the pricing changes discussed above.

Incentive compensation is tied to the achievement of specified objectives, including revenue growth, profit margin, and EPS. Therefore, a significant portion of compensation and benefits expense will fluctuate with these measures. The increase in compensation and benefits expense from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to higher levels of incentive compensation. The decrease in compensation and benefits expense from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to a reduction in full-time employees through the Company’s past restructuring initiatives, partially offset by higher levels of incentives to employees as a result of the Company’s improved financial performance. The following table shows a comparison of certain compensation and benefits components and employee data: Growth Rate2005-2006 2006 2005 2004 Salaries and wages 4 % $ 872 $ 842 $ 958 Incentive compensation (1) 30 % 504 389 258 Employee benefits and other 11 % 243 218 240 Total compensation and benefits expense 12 % $ 1,619 $ 1,449 $ 1,456 Full-time equivalent employees (in thousands) (2) At year end 7 % 12.4 11.6 11.8 Average 5 % 11.9 11.3 13.1 (1) Includes incentives, discretionary bonus costs, long-term incentive plan compensation, and stock-based compensation. (2) Includes full-time, part-time and temporary employees, and persons employed on a contract basis, but excludes professional services related to outsourced service providers. Amounts have been adjusted to exclude U.S. Trust in light of its pending sale. - 23 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) The increases in incentive compensation expense from 2004 to 2006 were primarily due to higher levels of discretionary bonuses to employees and long-term incentive plan compensation in 2005, and increases in incentives and long-term incentive plan compensation in 2006. Expenses Excluding Compensation and Benefits The increase in professional services expense from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to higher levels of fees paid to outsourced service providers and consultants. The decrease in occupancy and equipment expense from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to the Company’s past restructuring initiatives and other expense reduction measures. The increase in advertising and market development expense from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to the Company’s media spending related to its “Talk to Chuck™” national advertising campaign during 2006. The decrease in communications from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to decreases in telecommunication services, news and quotes services, and market data fees. Restructuring During 2001 to 2004, the Company carried out a series of restructuring initiatives which were designed to strengthen its productivity and efficiency and increase profitability. These initiatives included workforce reductions, reductions in operating facilities, the removal of certain systems hardware, software, and equipment from service, and the withdrawal from certain international operations. The Company completed its 2004 cost reduction effort in the first half of 2005. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CSC conducts substantially all of its business through its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The capital structure among CSC and its subsidiaries is designed to provide each entity with capital and liquidity to meet its operational needs and regulatory requirements. CSC is a financial holding company, which is a type of bank holding company subject to supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. In July 2006, USTC (currently reflected as a discontinued operation for financial statement purposes) became a financial holding company. CSC and its depository institution subsidiaries, which include Schwab Bank and U.S. Trust, are subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s risk-based and leverage capital guidelines. These regulations require banks and bank holding companies to maintain minimum levels of capital. In addition, CSC’s depository institution subsidiaries are subject to limitations on the amount of dividends they can pay to CSC. Based on their respective regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company’s depository institution subsidiaries are considered well capitalized. Liquidity CSC CSC’s liquidity needs are generally met through cash generated by its subsidiaries, as well as cash provided by external financing. Schwab and Schwab Bank are subject to regulatory requirements that may restrict them from certain transactions with CSC. Management believes that funds generated by the operations of CSC’s subsidiaries will continue to be the primary funding source in meeting CSC’s liquidity needs, providing adequate liquidity to meet Schwab Bank’s capital guidelines, and maintaining Schwab’s net capital. CSC has liquidity needs that arise from its Senior Medium-Term Notes, Series A (Medium-Term Notes), as well as from the funding of cash dividends, acquisitions, and other investments. The Medium-Term Notes, of which $262 million was - 24 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) issued and outstanding at December 31, 2006, have maturities ranging from 2007 to 2010 and fixed interest rates ranging from 6.52% to 8.05% with interest payable semiannually. The Medium-Term Notes are rated A2 by Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), A- by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group (S&P), and A by Fitch IBCA, Inc. (Fitch). CSC has a prospectus supplement on file with the SEC enabling CSC to issue up to $750 million in Senior or Senior Subordinated Medium-Term Notes, Series A. At December 31, 2006, all of these notes remained unissued. CSC has a Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933 on Form S-3 on file with the SEC relating to a universal shelf registration for the issuance of up to $1.0 billion aggregate amount of various securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, and warrants. At December 31, 2006, all of these securities remained unissued. CSC has authorization from its Board of Directors to issue commercial paper up to the amount of CSC’s committed, unsecured credit facility (see below), not to exceed $1.5 billion. At December 31, 2006, no commercial paper had been issued. CSC’s ratings for these short-term borrowings are P-1 by Moody’s, A-2 by S&P, and F1 by Fitch. CSC maintains an $800 million committed, unsecured credit facility with a group of eighteen banks which is scheduled to expire in June 2007. CSC plans to establish a similar facility to replace this one when it expires. These facilities were unused in 2006. Any issuances under CSC’s commercial paper program will reduce the amount available under this facility. The funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes and CSC pays a commitment fee on the unused balance of this facility. The financial covenants in this facility require CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity, Schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, as defined, and CSC’s depository institution subsidiaries to be well capitalized, as defined. Management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on its ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements. CSC also has direct access to $792 million of the $842 million uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines, provided by eight banks, that are primarily utilized by Schwab to manage short-term liquidity. The amount available to CSC under these lines is lower than the amount available to Schwab because the credit line provided by one of these banks is only available to Schwab. These lines were not used by CSC in 2006. Schwab Most of Schwab’s assets are readily convertible to cash, consisting primarily of short-term (i.e., less than 150 days) investment-grade, interest-earning investments (the majority of which are segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients pursuant to regulatory requirements), receivables from brokerage clients, and receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations. Client margin loans are demand loan obligations secured by readily marketable securities. Receivables from and payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations primarily represent current open transactions, which usually settle, or can be closed out, within a few business days. Liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts, which were $19.9 billion, $24.2 billion, and $27.0 billion at December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for Schwab in the future. The Company has a lease financing liability related to an office building and land under a 20-year lease. The remaining lease financing liability of $126 million at December 31, 2006 is being reduced by a portion of the lease payments over the remaining lease term. To manage short-term liquidity, Schwab maintains uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines with a group of eight banks totaling $842 million at December 31, 2006. The need for short-term borrowings arises primarily from timing differences - 25 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) between cash flow requirements and the scheduled liquidation of interest-bearing investments. Schwab used such borrowings for twelve days in 2006, with daily amounts borrowed averaging $79 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2006. To satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), Schwab has unsecured letter of credit agreements with eleven banks in favor of the OCC aggregating $930 million at December 31, 2006. Schwab pays a fee to maintain these arrangements. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. Schwab satisfies the collateral requirements by arranging letters of credit (LOCs), in favor of these brokerage clients, which are issued by multiple banks. At December 31, 2006, the aggregate face amount of these outstanding LOCs totaled $173 million. No funds were drawn under these LOCs at December 31, 2006. Schwab is subject to regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit Schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings to CSC, paying cash dividends, or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent or employees if such payment would result in net capital of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000. At December 31, 2006, Schwab’s net capital was $1.1 billion (10% of aggregate debit balances), which was $850 million in excess of its minimum required net capital and $511 million in excess of 5% of aggregate debit balances. Schwab targets net capital to be at least 10% of its aggregate debit balances, which primarily consist of client margin loans. To manage Schwab’s regulatory capital requirement, CSC provides Schwab with a $1.4 billion subordinated revolving credit facility which is scheduled to expire in March 2008. The amount outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2006 was $220 million. Borrowings under this subordinated lending arrangement qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab. Schwab Bank Schwab Bank’s current liquidity needs are generally met through deposits from banking clients and equity capital. The excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts is swept into a money market deposit account at Schwab Bank. At December 31, 2006, these balances totaled $9.9 billion. Schwab Bank has access to traditional funding sources such as deposits, federal funds purchased, and repurchase agreements. Additionally, CSC provides Schwab Bank with a $100 million short-term credit facility maturing in December 2007. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab Bank. No funds were drawn under this facility at December 31, 2006. Schwab Bank maintains a credit facility with the Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLB). At December 31, 2006, $683 million was available, and no funds were drawn under this facility. U.S. Trust (currently reflected as a discontinued operation for financial statement purposes) The liquidity needs of U.S. Trust are generally met through deposits from banking clients, equity capital, and borrowings. The excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts is swept into a money market deposit account at U.S. Trust. At December 31, 2006, these balances totaled $749 million. In addition to traditional funding sources such as deposits, federal funds purchased, and repurchase agreements, USTC’s depository institution subsidiaries have established their own external funding sources. At December 31, 2006, U.S. Trust had $52 million in Trust Preferred Capital Securities outstanding with a fixed interest rate of 8.41%. In - 26 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) December 2006, U.S. Trust elected to and submitted notice to redeem all of the outstanding Trust Preferred Capital Securities on February 1, 2007. Certain of USTC’s depository institution subsidiaries have established credit facilities with the FHLB totaling $2.3 billion. At December 31, 2006, $100 million was outstanding under these facilities. Additionally, at December 31, 2006, U.S. Trust had $1 million of federal funds purchased. U.S. Trust also engages in intercompany repurchase agreements with Schwab and had $200 million outstanding with Schwab at December 31, 2006. CSC provides U.S. Trust with a $300 million short-term credit facility maturing in December 2007. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for U.S. Trust. No funds were drawn under this facility at December 31, 2006. U.S. Trust uses interest rate swap agreements (Swaps) with third parties to hedge the interest rate risk primarily associated with its variable rate deposits from banking clients. These Swaps are structured for U.S. Trust to receive a variable rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest. At December 31, 2006, the Swaps had a notional value of $660 million and a fair value of $6 million. Prior to or as of the closing date of the sale of U.S. Trust, all of the arrangements with U.S. Trust disclosed above, except for the credit facilities with the FHLB and the Swaps, will be cancelled or terminated. Capital Resources The Company monitors both the relative composition and absolute level of its capital structure. Management is focused on limiting the Company’s use of capital and currently targets a long-term debt to total financial capital ratio of less than 20%. The Company’s total financial capital (long-term debt plus stockholders’ equity) at December 31, 2006 was $5.4 billion, up $484 million from December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, the Company had long-term debt of $388 million, or 7% of total financial capital, that bears interest at a weighted-average rate of 7.02%. At December 31, 2005, the Company had long-term debt of $462 million, or 9% of total financial capital. The Company’s cash position (reported as cash and cash equivalents on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet) and cash flows are affected by changes in brokerage client cash balances and the associated amounts required to be segregated under federal or other regulatory guidelines. Timing differences between cash and investments actually segregated on a given date and the amount required to be segregated for that date may arise in the ordinary course of business and are addressed by the Company in accordance with applicable regulations. Other factors which affect the Company’s cash position and cash flows include investment activity in securities, levels of capital expenditures, acquisition and divestiture activity, banking client deposit activity, brokerage and banking client loan activity, financing activity in long-term debt, payments of dividends, and repurchases of CSC’s common stock. The combination of these factors can cause significant fluctuations in the levels of cash and cash equivalents during specific time periods. In 2006, cash and cash equivalents increased $2.6 billion, or 137%, to $4.5 billion primarily due to movements of brokerage client-related funds to meet segregation requirements and an increase in deposits from banking clients. These changes were partially offset by a decrease in payables to brokerage clients and an increase in securities available for sale. The Company repaid $68 million and $56 million of long-term debt in 2006 and 2005, respectively. - 27 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Capital Expenditures In 2006, the Company’s capital expenditures were $122 million. The Company sold $63 million of fixed assets, which primarily consisted of a data center. In 2005, the Company’s capital expenditures were $98 million and the Company sold $20 million of fixed assets. Capital expenditures, net, as a percentage of net revenues totaled 1% and 2% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2006 and 2005, capital expenditures were primarily for software and equipment relating to the Company’s information technology systems. Capital expenditures include capitalized costs for developing internal-use software of $42 million in 2006 and $32 million in 2005. Management currently anticipates that 2007 capital expenditures will be approximately 40% higher than 2006 spending, primarily due to increased spending on capitalized costs for developing internal-use software and assets relating to the Company’s information technology systems. As has been the case in recent years, the Company may adjust its capital expenditures from period to period as business conditions change. Management believes that funds generated by its operations will continue to be the primary funding source of its capital expenditures. Dividends CSC paid common stock cash dividends of $173 million and $116 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Since the initial dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 71 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the dividend 18 times, including a 20% and 67% increase in the second and fourth quarters of 2006, respectively. Since 1989, dividends have increased by a 28% compounded annual growth rate. CSC paid common stock dividends of $.135, $.089, and $.074 per share in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, the Company currently targets its cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income. Share Repurchases CSC repurchased 52 million shares of its common stock for $859 million in 2006 and 56 million shares of its common stock for $688 million in 2005. As of December 31, 2006, CSC had authority to repurchase up to $87 million of its common stock under prior authorization by the Board of Directors. On January 24, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of CSC’s common stock in addition to this remaining authorization. Acquisition and Divestiture Upon completion of the pending sale of U.S. Trust in 2007, the Company will receive pre-tax proceeds of approximately $3.3 billion. The Company plans to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and continued investment in Schwab Investor Services, Schwab Institutional, and Schwab Bank. On December 22, 2006, the Company announced an agreement to acquire The 401(k) Company from Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. for $115 million in cash. The transaction is expected to close in March 2007, subject to customary closing conditions. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements The Company enters into various off-balance-sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of its clients. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, the Company enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For information on each of these arrangements, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 18. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.” - 28 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Contractual Obligations A summary of the Company’s principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006 is shown in the following table. Excluded from this table are liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet that are generally short-term in nature (e.g., drafts payable) or without contractual payment terms (e.g., deposits from banking clients, payables to brokerage clients, and deferred compensation). Management believes that funds generated by its continuing operations, as well as cash provided by external financing, will continue to be the primary funding sources in meeting these obligations.

RISK MANAGEMENT Overview The Company’s business activities expose it to a variety of risks including technology and operations risk, credit, market and liquidity risks, and legal and reputational risk. Identification and management of these risks are essential to the success and financial soundness of the Company. Senior management takes an active role in the Company’s risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling various risks. Oversight of risk management has been delegated to the Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior managers of major business and control functions. The Global Risk Committee is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the Company’s risk exposures, and leading the continued development of the Company’s risk management policies and practices. Functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report into the Global Risk Committee. These sub-committees include: • Corporate Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee, which focuses on the Company’s liquidity, capital resources, and interest rate risk; • Credit and Market Risk Oversight Committee, which focuses on the credit exposures resulting from client activity (e.g., margin lending activities and loans to banking clients), the investing activities of certain of the Company’s - 29 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) proprietary funds, corporate credit activities (e.g., counterparty and corporate investing activities), and market risk resulting from the Company taking positions in certain securities to facilitate client trading activity; • Technology and Operations Risk Committee, which focuses on the integrity of controls and operating capacity of the Company’s systems and operations processes; • Fiduciary Risk Committee, which oversees activities of the Company with a fiduciary component; • New Products Committee, which addresses risks associated with new products and services; and • Information Security and Privacy Steering Committee, which oversees information security and privacy programs and policies. The Global Risk Committee reports regularly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Audit Committee), which reviews major risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The Company’s Disclosure Committee is responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s (a) disclosure controls and procedures and (b) internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Additionally, the Company’s compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and risk and credit management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring the Company’s risk management. Risk is inherent in the Company’s business. Consequently, despite the Company’s efforts to identify areas of risk, oversee operational areas involving risk, and implement policies and procedures designed to manage risk, there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer unexpected losses due to operating or other risks. The following discussion highlights the Company’s policies and procedures for identification, assessment, and management of the principal areas of risk in its operations. Technology and Operating Risk Technology and operating risk is the potential for loss due to deficiencies in control processes or technology systems that constrain the Company’s ability to gather, process and communicate information and process client transactions efficiently and securely, without interruptions. The Company’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and the Company’s success depends, in part, on its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its technology in anticipation of evolving client needs. To the extent the Company experiences system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to its systems, linkages with third-party systems, and power failures), the Company’s business and operations could be significantly negatively impacted. Additionally, rapid increases in client demand may strain the Company’s ability to enhance its technology and expand its operating capacity. To minimize business interruptions, Schwab has two data centers intended, in part, to further improve the recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency. The Company is committed to an ongoing process of upgrading, enhancing, and testing its technology systems. This effort is focused on meeting client needs, meeting market and regulatory changes, and deploying standardized technology platforms. Technology and operating risk also includes the risk of human error, employee misconduct, external fraud, computer viruses, terrorist attack, and natural disaster. Employee misconduct could include fraud and misappropriation of client or Company assets, improper use or disclosure of confidential client or Company information, and unauthorized activities, such as transactions exceeding acceptable risks or authorized limits. External fraud includes misappropriation of client or Company assets by third parties, including through unauthorized access to Company systems and data and client accounts. The frequency and sophistication of such fraud attempts continue to increase. - 30 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) The Company has specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and uses periodic risk self-assessments and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The Company maintains backup and recovery functions, including facilities for backup and communications, and conducts periodic testing of disaster recovery plans. The Company also maintains policies and procedures and technology to protect against fraud and unauthorized access to systems and data. Despite the Company’s risk management efforts, it is not always possible to deter or prevent technological or operational failure, or fraud or other misconduct, and the precautions taken by the Company may not be effective in all cases. The Company may be subject to litigation, losses, and regulatory actions in such cases, and may be required to expend significant additional resources to remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures. The Company also faces technology and operating risk when it employs the services of various external vendors, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, and support functions. The Company manages its exposure to such outsourcing risks through contractual agreements, enhanced controls, and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance. The Company maintains policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with Company data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-public client information. The Company clearly defines for employees, contractors, and vendors the Company’s expected standards of care for confidential data. Regular training is provided by the Company in regard to data security. The Company is actively engaged in the research and development of new technologies, services, and products. The Company endeavors to protect its research and development efforts, and its brands, through the use of copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and contracts. Credit Risk Credit risk is the potential for loss due to a client or counterparty failing to perform its contractual obligations, or the value of collateral held to secure obligations proving to be inadequate. The Company’s direct exposure to credit risk mainly results from margin lending activities, securities lending activities, its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities, and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the Company’s proprietary funds. To manage the risks of such losses, the Company has established policies and procedures which include: establishing and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin requirements for certain securities. In addition, most of the Company’s credit extensions, such as margin loans to clients, securities lending agreements, and resale agreements, are supported by collateral arrangements. These arrangements are subject to requirements to provide additional collateral in the event that market fluctuations result in declines in the value of collateral received. Additionally, the Company has exposure to credit risk associated with the Company’s banking loan portfolios held at Schwab Bank and U.S. Trust (currently reflected as a discontinued operation for financial statement purposes). This client credit exposure is actively managed through individual and portfolio reviews performed by account officers and senior line management. Periodic assessment of the validity of credit ratings, credit quality and the credit management process is conducted by a credit review department which is separate from the loan origination and monitoring department. Management regularly reviews asset quality including concentrations, delinquencies, non-performing loans to banking clients, losses, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses, which is reviewed quarterly by senior management. Schwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab’s client or a counterparty fails to meet its obligations to Schwab. - 31 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Fiduciary Risk Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. The Company attempts to manage this risk by establishing procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various fiduciary risk committees. Legal and Regulatory Risk The Company faces significant legal and compliance risk in its business, and the volume of litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services firms and the amount of damages claimed have been increasing. Among other things, these risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for Company products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of the Company’s controls. Claims against the Company may increase due to a variety of factors, such as if clients suffer losses during a period of deteriorating equity market conditions, as the Company increases the level of advice it provides to clients, and as the Company enhances the services it provides to IAs. In addition, the Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, and SROs, and such regulation is becoming increasingly extensive and complex. The Company attempts to manage legal and compliance risk through policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid litigation claims and prevent or detect violations of applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, client privacy, employment policies, and contracts management. Despite the Company’s efforts to maintain an effective compliance program and internal controls, legal breaches and rule violations could result in reputational harm, significant losses and disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on the Company’s business activities. - 32 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. While the majority of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position and reported financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy. Income Tax Benefit Related to the Pending Sale of U.S. Trust: In 2006, the Company recorded a $205 million income tax benefit related to the estimated difference between the tax and book bases of the Company’s U.S. Trust stock. This amount is included in income from discontinued operations, net of tax on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. When calculating the Company’s gain on the sale of U.S. Trust for income tax purposes, the tax basis will be the basis of U.S. Trust’s prior stockholders in their shares as of the date U.S. Trust was acquired by the Company, since the transaction qualified as a tax-free exchange. This tax benefit is management’s current estimate and is based on publicly available information, including information on the composition of U.S. Trust’s stockholders at the acquisition date and the market price of U.S. Trust stock during relevant periods. The final amount of the basis difference, which could differ from management’s estimate, will be determined following a survey of former U.S. Trust stockholders that the Company expects to complete in mid-2007. Valuation of Goodwill: Under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually, or whenever indications of impairment exist. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, resulting in an impairment charge for this excess. The Company has elected April 1 as its annual goodwill impairment testing date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on April 1, 2006, management estimated the fair value of each of the Company’s reporting units (generally defined as the Company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) and compared this value to the carrying value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit was greater than its carrying value, and therefore management concluded that no amount of goodwill was impaired. The estimated fair value of the reporting units was established using a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit. Adverse changes in the Company’s planned business operations such as unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit, or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the Company’s recorded goodwill. The Company’s goodwill balance, net of accumulated amortization, was $419 million at both December 31, 2006 and 2005. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities: As part of its asset and liability management process, the Company has entered into Swaps that effectively convert the interest rate characteristics of a portion of the Company’s Medium-Term Notes from fixed to variable. The Company has designated such Swaps as fair value hedges, as allowed by SFAS No. 133 – Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Since the notional amount, fixed interest rate, and maturity of these Swaps exactly match the terms of the corresponding Medium-Term Notes, the Company has concluded that these Swaps are completely effective in achieving the desired hedging results, as permitted under SFAS No. 133. Consequently, changes in the fair value of these Swaps, totaling an aggregate of approximately $500,000 and $2 million asset at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, are completely offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged Medium-Term Notes. Accordingly, there has not been any impact on earnings as a result of this hedging program except for the conversion from a fixed to a floating rate of interest on a portion of the Medium-Term Notes. - 33 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Schwab Bank’s loans held for sale portfolio consists of fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgages, which are subject to a loss in value when market interest rates rise. Schwab Bank uses forward sale commitments to manage this risk. These forward sale commitments have been designated as cash flow hedging instruments of the loans held for sale. Accordingly, the fair values of these forward sale commitments are recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, with gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). Additionally, Schwab Bank uses forward sale commitments to hedge interest rate lock commitments issued on mortgage loans that will be held for sale. Schwab Bank considers the fair value of these commitments to be zero at the commitment date, with subsequent changes in fair value determined solely based on changes in market interest rates. Any changes in fair value of the interest rate lock commitments are completely offset by changes in fair value of the related forward sale commitments. At both December 31, 2006 and 2005, the derivative assets and liabilities recorded by Schwab Bank for these forward sale and interest rate lock commitments were immaterial. Allowance for Credit Losses: The Company regularly evaluates its portfolio of loans to banking clients and provides allowances for the portion management believes may be uncollectible. Several factors are taken into consideration in this evaluation including current economic conditions, the composition of the loan portfolio, past loss experience, and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. For Schwab Bank’s portfolio, which primarily consists of mortgage loans, a risk-based methodology is used to determine the allowance for credit losses. Mortgage loans are categorized into portfolios by loan type and risk characteristics. A probable loss rate, based on company and industry experience, is used to determine the credit allowance. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company’s allowance for credit losses was $4 million and $3 million on loan portfolios of $2.3 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. Legal Reserve: Reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, insurance coverage and indemnification, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved. Stock-based compensation: The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R – Share-Based Payment. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term of stock options, the expected volatility of the Company’s common stock, and expected dividends. Significant changes in these assumptions for future awards could materially impact stock-based compensation expense and the Company’s results of operations. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the Company’s results of operations could be impacted. Long-term incentive compensation: Eligible officers may receive cash long-term incentive plan units under a long-term incentive plan (LTIP). These awards are restricted from transfer or sale and generally vest over a three- to four-year period. Each award provides for a one-time cash payment for an amount that varies based upon the Company’s cumulative EPS over the respective performance period of each grant. The Company accrues the estimated total cost for each grant on a straight-line basis over each LTIP’s vesting period, with periodic cumulative adjustments to expense as estimates of the total grant cost are revised. The estimated total cost of each grant will vary based upon changes in - 34 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) estimated and actual cumulative EPS amounts over each LTIP’s performance period. Grants were issued under this LTIP in 2003, 2004, and 2005 with performance periods ending December 31, 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. The LTIP liability including discontinued operations was $140 million and $61 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The LTIP expense including discontinued operations was $78 million, $37 million, and $15 million for the years 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The Company’s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee. Additionally, management has reviewed with the Audit Committee the Company’s significant estimates discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Certain of these factors, as well as general risk factors affecting the Company, are discussed in greater detail in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Item 1A – Risk Factors.” - 36 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential for loss due to a change in the value of a financial instrument held by the Company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, or currency exchange rates. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interest-earning assets (mainly margin loans to clients, investments, loans to banking clients, mortgage-backed securities, and other fixed-rate investments) and its funding sources (including brokerage client cash balances, banking deposits, proceeds from stock-lending activities, and long-term debt) which finance these assets. To mitigate the risk of loss, the Company has established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk, and by monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interest-earning assets and funding sources. The Company also has the ability to adjust the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and certain banking deposits and the rates charged on margin loans. The Company’s exposure to equity price and currency exchange risks is not material. Financial Instruments Held For Trading Purposes The Company holds fixed income securities, which include municipal and government securities, and corporate bonds, in inventory to meet clients’ trading needs. The fair value of such inventory was approximately $76 million and $74 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These securities, and the associated interest rate risk, are not material to the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Financial Instruments Held For Purposes Other Than Trading Debt Issuances At December 31, 2006, CSC had $262 million aggregate principal amount of Medium-Term Notes outstanding, with fixed interest rates ranging from 6.52% to 8.05%. At December 31, 2005, CSC had $330 million aggregate principal amount of Medium-Term Notes outstanding, with fixed interest rates ranging from 6.21% to 8.05%. The Company has fixed cash flow requirements regarding these long-term debt obligations due to the fixed rate of interest. The fair value of these obligations at December 31, 2006 and 2005, based on estimates of market rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities, was $277 million and $352 million, respectively, compared to their carrying amounts of $262 million and $332 million, respectively. Interest Rate Swaps As part of its consolidated asset and liability management process, the Company utilizes Swaps to effectively convert the interest rate characteristics of a portion of its Medium Term Notes from fixed to variable. For a discussion of such Swaps, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 19. Financial Instruments Subject to Off-Balance Sheet Risk, Credit Risk, or Market Risk.” Forward Sale and Interest Rate Lock Commitments For a discussion of Schwab Bank’s forward sale and interest rate lock commitments related to its loans held for sale portfolio, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 19. Financial Instruments Subject to Off-Balance Sheet Risk, Credit Risk, or Market Risk.” - 37 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Net Interest Revenue Simulation The Company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulation model (the model) includes all interest-sensitive assets and liabilities, as well as Swaps utilized by the Company to hedge its interest rate risk. Key variables in the model include assumed balance growth or decline for client loans, deposits, brokerage client cash, changes in the level and term structure of interest rates, the repricing of financial instruments, prepayment and reinvestment assumptions, and product pricing assumptions. The simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies, including changes in asset and liability mix. As demonstrated by the simulations presented below, the Company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall (i.e., interest-earning assets are repricing more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities). The forward-looking simulations in the following table exclude all of U.S. Trust’s net interest revenue in 2006 and assume that the sale will close early in the third quarter of 2007. In addition, the simulations assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As the Company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood the Company would take steps to manage any additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment. The following table shows the results of a gradual 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates relative to the Company’s current base rate forecast on simulated net interest revenue over the next twelve months at December 31, 2006 and 2005. December 31, 2006 2005 Increase of 200 basis points 5.4 % 5.2 % Decrease of 200 basis points (8.5 %) (5.7 %) The simulations show an increase in exposure to rate changes at December 31, 2006 from December 31, 2005, and the Company remains positioned to experience increases in net interest revenue as rates rise and decreases as rates fall. If U.S. Trust’s net interest revenue is excluded from the 2005 simulations, the simulations would have shown net interest revenue increasing 7.5% for an increase of 200 basis points and decreasing 7.5% for a decline of 200 basis points. - 38 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION",2023-12-30 18:56:41.947044
316709,SCHW,SCHWAB CHARLES CORP,2008,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Management of the Company focuses on several key financial and non-financial metrics in evaluating the Company’s financial position and operating performance. All information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is presented on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted. Results for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 are shown in the following table: Growth Rate1-year2006-2007 2007 2006 2005 Client Activity Metrics: Net new client assets (in billions) (1, 2) 92 % $ 160.2 $ 83.3 $ 79.6 Client assets (in billions, at year end) 17 % $ 1,445.5 $ 1,239.2 $ 1,053.5 Clients’ daily average trades (in thousands) 6 % 284.9 270.0 221.4 Company Financial Metrics: Net revenue growth from prior year 16 % 19 % 6 % Pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations 37.1 % 34.3 % 28.4 % Return on stockholders’ equity 55 % 26 % 16 % Net revenue per average full-time equivalent employee(in thousands) 7 % $ 387 $ 362 $ 319 (1) Net new client assets in 2007 includes $23.0 billion related to the acquisition of The 401(k) Company and $3.3 billion related to a mutual fund clearing services client. (2) Effective in 2007, amounts include the Company’s mutual fund clearing services business’ daily net settlements. All prior period amounts have been recast to reflect this change. • Net new client assets is defined as the total inflows of client cash and securities to the firm less client outflows. Management believes that this metric depicts how well the Company’s products and services appeal to new and existing clients. • Client assets is the market value of all client assets housed at the Company. Management considers client assets to be indicative of the Company’s appeal in the marketplace. Additionally, growth in certain components of client assets (e.g., Mutual Fund OneSource funds) directly impacts asset management and administration fee revenues. • Clients’ daily average trades is an indicator of client engagement with securities markets and the most prominent driver of trading revenues. • Management believes that net revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations, and return on stockholders’ equity provide broad indicators of the Company’s overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns. • Net revenue per average full-time equivalent employee is considered by management to be the Company’s broadest measure of productivity. The Company’s net revenues are classified into asset-based and other (i.e., asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and other revenue) and trading categories. The Company generates asset-based and other revenues primarily through asset management and administration fees earned through its proprietary and third-party mutual fund offerings, as well as fee-based investment management and advisory services, and interest revenue earned on margin loans, loans to banking clients, and investments. Asset-based and other revenues are impacted by securities valuations, interest rates, the Company’s ability to attract new clients, and client activity levels. The Company generates trading revenues through commissions earned for - 16 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenues from trading activity in fixed income securities. Trading revenues are impacted by trading volumes, the volatility of equity prices in the securities markets and commission rates. 2007 was marked by increased concerns relating to the housing and credit markets, declining short-term interest rates, and significant securities market volatility. Overall equity market returns for the year showed gains for the three major indices – the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 6%, the Standard and Poor’s 500 Index increased 4%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index increased 10%. The Company improved its operating and financial performance in 2007 by focusing on the client experience in each of its three segments and delivering high quality products and services at competitive prices. Net new client assets totaled $160.2 billion for the year, up 92% from a year ago. Assets in client accounts were $1.446 trillion at December 31, 2007, up 17% from 2006. Active brokerage accounts totaled 7.0 million at December 31, 2007, up 5% from 2006. Banking accounts totaled 262,000 at December 31, 2007, up 78% from 2006. Corporate retirement plan participants totaled 1.2 million at December 31, 2007, up 122% from 2006. Net revenues increased by 16% compared to 2006 primarily due to an increase in asset management and administration fees driven by growth in client assets, as well as an increase in net interest revenue due to higher interest rate spreads. The Company achieved a pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations of 37.1% in 2007 due to revenue growth and disciplined expense management during the year. Return on stockholders’ equity increased to 55% in 2007, compared to 26% in 2006, reflecting the sale of U.S. Trust, earnings growth, and the Company’s continued active management of its capital base. Net revenue per average full-time equivalent employee was $387,000 in 2007, up 7% from 2006 due to revenue growth partially offset by the increase in full-time equivalent employees as a result of the acquisition of The 401(k) Company in March 2007. Capital Restructuring During 2007, CSC completed a capital restructuring that returned approximately $3.3 billion in capital to stockholders to create a more efficient and cost-effective capital structure. The capital restructuring included the following components: • CSC paid a special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share, which returned $1.2 billion to stockholders. The special dividend was paid on August 24, 2007, to stockholders of record on July 24, 2007. • In August 2007, CSC repurchased 84 million shares of its common stock through a modified “Dutch Auction” Tender Offer (Tender Offer). The Tender Offer period closed on July 31, 2007 and CSC accepted for purchase 84 million shares of its common stock, at a purchase price of $20.50 per share, for a total purchase price of $1.7 billion. • CSC executed a separate Stock Purchase Agreement with Chairman and CEO Charles R. Schwab, CSC’s largest stockholder, and with certain additional stockholders whose shares Mr. Schwab is deemed to beneficially own. Under the Stock Purchase Agreement, Mr. Schwab and the other stockholders who are parties to the agreement did not participate in the Tender Offer, but instead, sold, and CSC purchased, 18 million shares, at a purchase price ($20.50 per share), which is the same as was determined and paid in the Tender Offer, for a total purchase price of $369 million. The number of shares repurchased resulted in Mr. Schwab maintaining the same beneficial percentage interest in CSC’s outstanding common stock that he had prior to the Tender Offer and sale of shares pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement (approximately 18 percent, which does not take into consideration Mr. Schwab’s outstanding options to acquire stock). The shares under this agreement were repurchased on August 15, 2007. • In September 2007, CSC issued $250 million of 6.375% Senior Medium-Term Notes due in 2017. In October 2007, CSC issued $300 million of junior subordinated notes. For further discussion of the issuance of the junior subordinated notes, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 12. Borrowings.” - 17 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Discontinued Operations On July 1, 2007, the Company completed the sale of all of the outstanding common stock of U.S. Trust for $3.3 billion in cash. CSC recognized a gain on the sale of $1.9 billion, or $1.2 billion after tax, in the third quarter of 2007. The results of operations, net of income taxes, and cash flows of U.S. Trust have been presented as discontinued operations on the Company’s consolidated statements of income and of cash flows for all periods through the date of the sale. The assets and liabilities of U.S. Trust prior to the sale have each been combined and presented as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s consolidated prior period revenues, expenses, taxes on income, assets, liabilities, and cash flows also reflect this presentation. In 2004, the Company sold its capital markets business to UBS and thereby eliminated the revenues and expenses unique to the capital markets business. The results of operations, net of income taxes, of the capital markets business have been presented as discontinued operations on the Company’s consolidated statements of income for all periods. 2007 2006 2005 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax: Sale of U.S. Trust $ 1,287 $ 333 $ 96 Sale of capital markets business — 3 (5 ) Total $ 1,287 $ 336 $ 91 Business Acquisition On March 31, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of The 401(k) Company, which offers retirement plan services, for $115 million in cash. As a result of a purchase price allocation, the Company recorded goodwill of $106 million and intangible assets of $8 million. The intangible assets will be amortized over 16 years. Segment Information The Company provides financial services to individuals, and institutional and corporate clients through three segments – Schwab Investor Services, Schwab Institiutional®, and Schwab Corporate and Retirement Services. As a result of organizational and related business changes in the second quarter of 2007, the corporate and retirement services business, which was historically included within the Schwab Investor Services segment, has been separated into its own segment called Schwab Corporate and Retirement Services. Additionally, the mutual fund clearing services business, which was historically included in unallocated and other, is included within the Schwab Corporate and Retirement Services segment. Previously-reported segment information has been revised to reflect these changes. The Schwab Investor Services segment includes the Company’s retail brokerage and banking operations. The Schwab Institutional segment provides custodial, trading, and support services to independent investment advisors. The Schwab Corporate and Retirement Services segment provides retirement plan services, plan administrator services, stock plan services, and mutual fund clearing services and supports the availability of Schwab proprietary mutual funds on third-party platforms. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments on a pre-tax basis excluding items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges, discontinued operations, and extraordinary items. Segment assets are not disclosed because the balances are not used for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments. - 18 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Financial information for the Company’s reportable segments is presented in the following table: For the year ended December 31, Growth Rate2006 - 2007 2007 2006 2005 Schwab Investor Services: Net revenues 14 % $ 3,352 $ 2,940 $ 2,504 Expenses excluding interest 7 % 2,115 1,982 1,805 Contribution margin 29 % $ 1,237 $ 958 $ 699 Schwab Institutional: Net revenues 16 % $ 1,121 $ 966 $ 803 Expenses excluding interest 14 % 639 562 486 Contribution margin 19 % $ 482 $ 404 $ 317 Schwab Corporate and Retirement Services: Net revenues 36 % $ 506 $ 373 $ 294 Expenses excluding interest 37 % 367 268 212 Contribution margin 32 % $ 139 $ 105 $ 82 Unallocated and other: Net revenues N/M $ 15 $ 30 $ 18 Expenses excluding interest N/M 20 21 89 Contribution margin N/M $ (5 ) $ 9 $ (71 ) Total: Net revenues 16 % $ 4,994 $ 4,309 $ 3,619 Expenses excluding interest 11 % 3,141 2,833 2,592 Contribution margin 26 % $ 1,853 $ 1,476 $ 1,027 N/M Not meaningful. Schwab Investor Services Net revenues increased by $412 million, or 14%, from 2006 due to growth in net interest revenue and higher asset management and administration fees. Net interest revenue increased due to higher levels of market interest rates and changes in the composition of interest-earning assets, including increases in securities available for sale and loans to banking clients. Asset management and administration fees increased as a result of higher balances of client assets in the Company’s proprietary mutual funds and Mutual Fund OneSource® service, as well as balances participating in advisory and managed account service programs. Expenses excluding interest increased by $133 million, or 7%, from 2006 primarily due to higher client servicing and other related expenses, as well as higher market development expense. Schwab Institutional Net revenues increased by $155 million, or 16%, from 2006 due to higher asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue. Asset management and administration fees increased as a result of higher balances of client assets in the Company’s proprietary mutual funds and Mutual Fund OneSource® service, as well as balances participating in managed account service programs. Net interest revenue increased due to higher levels of client assets in interest-earning products, including increases in securities available for sale. Expenses excluding interest increased by $77 million, or 14%, from 2006 primarily due to higher business development, marketing and account servicing related expenses, as well as increased infrastructure investment. - 19 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Schwab Corporate and Retirement Services Net revenues increased by $133 million, or 36%, from 2006 due to higher asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and the acquisition of the 401(k) Company in March 2007. Asset management and administration fees increased as a result of higher mutual fund, advisory, and managed account asset balances. Net interest revenue increased due to higher levels of client assets in interest-earning products. Expenses excluding interest increased by $99 million, or 37%, from 2006 primarily due to higher account servicing and related costs as a result of the acquisition of the 401(k) Company and the corresponding increase in the number of corporate retirement plan participants and client assets. Unallocated and Other Net revenues decreased by $15 million, or 50%, from 2006 primarily due to the receipt of $25 million related to the confidential resolution of a legal matter in 2006.

The increases in asset-based and other revenues from 2005 to 2007 were primarily due to an increase in asset management and administration fees resulting from higher levels of client assets and an increase in net interest revenue resulting from higher interest rate spreads. Net interest revenue also increased due to the incremental interest revenue generated by temporarily investing the proceeds from the sale of U.S. Trust in the third quarter of 2007. The increase in trading revenues from 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades and higher average revenue earned per revenue trade. The increases in expenses excluding interest from 2005 to 2007 were primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense, advertising and market development expense, and professional services expense. The increase in the effective income tax rates on income from continuing operations from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to higher state taxes. The increases in income from continuing operations from 2005 to 2007 were primarily due to an increase in net revenues, partially offset by higher expenses excluding interest. The increase in net income from 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to the gain of $1.2 billion, after tax, on the sale of U.S. Trust in the third quarter of 2007. - 20 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current presentation.

The Company earns mutual fund service fees for transfer agent services, shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. These fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in third-party funds and the Company’s proprietary funds. The Company also earns asset management fees for advisory and managed account services, which are based on the daily balances of client assets subject to the specific fee for service. The fair values of client assets, which include proprietary and third-party mutual funds, are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data. Asset management and administration fees may vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and levels of net new client assets. The increase in asset management and administration fees from 2005 to 2007 was primarily due to higher mutual fund, advisory, and managed account asset balances. The $329 million, or 21% increase in mutual fund service fees from 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to a 26% rise in the Company’s proprietary mutual fund asset balances and an 11% increase in asset balances in Schwab’s Mutual Fund OneSource service. The $221 million, or 16% increase in mutual fund service fees from 2005 to 2006, was primarily due to a 28% rise in the Company’s proprietary mutual fund asset balances and an 18% increase in asset balances in Schwab’s Mutual Fund OneSource service. The $68 million, or 22%, and $82 million, or 36%, increase in investment management and trust fees from 2006 to 2007 and 2005 to 2006, respectively, was primarily due to higher balances of client assets participating in advisory and managed account services programs. At December 31, 2007, the Company’s total client assets increased $206.3 billion, or 17%, from December 31, 2006 due to $160.2 billion of net new client assets and $46.1 billion of net market gains. At December 31, 2006, the Company’s total client assets increased $185.7 billion, or 18%, from December 31, 2005 due to $83.3 billion of net new client assets and $102.4 billion of net market gains. Net Interest Revenue Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on certain assets (mainly margin loans to clients, investments of segregated client cash balances, loans to banking clients, and securities available for sale) and interest paid on supporting liabilities (mainly deposits from banking clients and brokerage client cash balances). Net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies. The Company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall (i.e., interest-earning assets generally reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities). In the event of falling interest rates, the Company might attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending the maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lock-in asset yields as well as by lowering rates paid to clients on interest-bearing liabilities. The Company’s flexibility in repricing these liabilities is increasingly constrained as short term rates approach zero. In clearing its clients’ trades, Schwab holds cash balances payable to clients. In most cases, Schwab pays its clients interest on cash balances awaiting investment, and may invest these funds and earn interest revenue. Margin loans arise when Schwab lends funds to clients on a secured basis to purchase securities. Pursuant to SEC regulations, client cash balances that are not used for margin lending are generally segregated into investment accounts that are maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients. When investing segregated client cash balances, Schwab must adhere to SEC regulations that restrict investments to U.S. government securities, participation certificates, mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association, certificates of deposit issued by U.S. banks and thrifts, and resale agreements collateralized by qualified securities. Schwab’s policies for credit quality and maximum maturity - 23 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) requirements are more restrictive than these SEC regulations. Schwab Bank also maintains investment portfolios for liquidity as well as to invest funding from deposits raised in excess of loans to clients. Schwab Bank invests in securities available for sale, including commercial paper, collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), corporate debt, and U.S. government securities. Schwab Bank lends funds to banking clients primarily in the form of mortgage loans. These loans are largely funded by interest-bearing deposits from banking clients. The Company’s interest-earning assets are financed primarily by interest-bearing brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients. Other funding sources include noninterest-bearing brokerage client cash balances, proceeds from stock-lending activities, and long-term debt, as well as stockholders’ equity. Client-related daily average balances, interest rates, and average net interest spread are summarized as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Interest-Earning Assets: Investments of segregated client cash balances: Average balance outstanding $ 9,991 $ 12,758 $ 17,007 Average interest rate 5.18 % 4.77 % 3.07 % Margin loans to clients: Average balance outstanding $ 10,736 $ 10,252 $ 9,780 Average interest rate 8.00 % 8.17 % 6.69 % Securities available for sale: Average balance outstanding (1,2) $ 7,334 $ 6,126 $ 3,376 Average interest rate 5.44 % 5.20 % 3.80 % Loans to banking clients: Average balance outstanding $ 2,786 $ 2,162 $ 1,613 Average interest rate 6.07 % 5.94 % 4.84 % Funding Sources: Interest-bearing brokerage client cash balances: Average balance outstanding $ 14,768 $ 17,865 $ 22,037 Average interest rate 2.23 % 2.38 % 1.72 % Interest-bearing banking deposits: Average balance outstanding (1) $ 12,047 $ 9,137 $ 5,597 Average interest rate 1.98 % 2.19 % 1.32 % Other interest-bearing sources: Average balance outstanding $ 1,961 $ 1,816 $ 1,585 Average interest rate 2.05 % 2.42 % 2.32 % Average noninterest-bearing portion $ 2,071 $ 2,480 $ 2,557 Summary: Total average balance on interest-earning assets $ 30,847 $ 31,298 $ 31,776 Average yield on interest-earning assets 6.30 % 6.05 % 4.35 % Total average balance on funding sources $ 30,847 $ 31,298 $ 31,776 Average interest rate on funding sources 1.97 % 2.14 % 1.54 % Average net interest spread 4.33 % 3.91 % 2.81 % (1) Amounts include assets and liabilities retained from discontinued operations as discussed below. (2) Amounts have been calculated based on amortized cost. The increases in net interest revenue in the last two years were primarily due to changes in the composition of interest-earning assets, including increases in securities available for sale, loans to banking clients, and margin loan balances, as well as generally higher yields on earning assets, partially offset by higher average balances on banking deposits. Since the Company establishes the rates paid on brokerage client cash balances and certain banking deposits and the rates charged on margin loans, it has some ability to manage its net interest spread. However, the spread - 24 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition. The Company’s average net interest spread increased from 2005 to 2007 as the average yield on interest-earning assets increased more than the average interest rate on funding sources. Net interest revenue also increased due to incremental interest revenue generated by temporarily investing the proceeds from the sale of U.S. Trust. The amount of excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts that is swept into money market deposit accounts at Schwab Bank (and at U.S. Trust through May 2007) has increased significantly since the program’s inception in 2003. Average interest-bearing banking deposits increased $2.9 billion, or 32%, to $12.0 billion from 2006 to 2007, and $3.5 billion, or 63%, to $9.1 billion from 2005 to 2006. Average securities available for sale balances increased $1.2 billion, or 20%, to $7.3 billion from 2006 to 2007, and $2.8 billion, or 81%, to $6.1 billion from 2005 to 2006, with higher levels of investments in corporate debt and mortgage-backed securities. Meanwhile, average interest-bearing brokerage client cash balances decreased $3.1 billion, or 17%, to $14.8 billion from 2006 to 2007, and $4.2 billion, or 19%, to $17.9 billion from 2005 to 2006. The decline in the average interest-bearing brokerage client cash balances led to a corresponding decline of $2.8 billion, or 22%, in average investments of segregated client cash balances to $10.0 billion from 2006 to 2007, and $4.2 billion, or 25%, to $12.8 billion from 2005 to 2006. Certain interest-bearing assets and liabilities of U.S. Trust retained by the Company: The excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts was previously swept into a money market deposit account at U.S. Trust. In May 2007, Schwab terminated this arrangement and moved all of these balances to a similar existing arrangement with Schwab Bank. At December 31, 2006, these balances totaled $749 million and were included in deposits from banking clients with a corresponding amount in assets retained from discontinued operations on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The interest expense related to these client deposit balances maintained at U.S. Trust is included in interest expense from continuing operations on the Company’s consolidated statements of income of $4 million, $11 million, and $6 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The corresponding interest revenue on the invested cash balances related to these deposits is included in interest revenue from continuing operations on the Company’s consolidated statements of income of $14 million, $38 million, and $22 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The interest revenue amount was calculated using the Company’s funds transfer pricing methodology. Other Revenue Other revenue generally includes net gains and losses on certain investments, service fees, and software maintenance fees. Trading Revenue Trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenues are affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. Principal transaction revenues are primarily comprised of revenues from client fixed income securities trading activity. Factors that influence principal transaction revenues include the volume of client trades, market price volatility, and competitive pressures. The increase in trading revenue from 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades and higher average revenue earned per revenue trade. The increase in trading revenue from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades, partially offset by lower average revenue earned per revenue trade as a result of reductions in commission pricing in 2006 and 2005. - 25 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) As shown in the following table, daily average revenue trades executed by the Company increased 5% in 2007. Average revenue earned per revenue trade increased 4% from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to a higher proportion of equity trading volume outside the Company’s active investor programs. Average revenue earned per revenue trade decreased 14% from 2005 to 2006, primarily due to the pricing changes discussed above.

Expenses Excluding Interest As shown in the table below, total expenses excluding interest increased in 2007 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense, advertising and market development expense, and professional services expense. Growth Rate2006-2007 2007 2006 2005 Compensation and benefits 10 % $ 1,781 $ 1,619 $ 1,449 Professional services 14 % 324 285 222 Occupancy and equipment 8 % 282 260 262 Advertising and market development 22 % 230 189 165 Communications 11 % 200 180 174 Depreciation and amortization (1 %) 156 157 179 Other 17 % 168 143 141 Total expenses excluding interest 11 % $ 3,141 $ 2,833 $ 2,592 Expenses as a percentage of total net revenues: Total expenses, excluding interest 63 % 66 % 72 % Advertising and market development 5 % 4 % 5 % Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits expense includes salaries and wages, incentive compensation, and related employee benefits and taxes. Incentive compensation is tied to the achievement of specified objectives, including revenue growth, profit margin, and EPS. Therefore, a significant portion of compensation and benefits expense will fluctuate with these measures. - 26 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) The increases in compensation and benefits expense from 2005 to 2007 were primarily due to an increase in full-time equivalent employees and higher levels of incentive compensation. The following table shows a comparison of certain compensation and benefits components and employee data: Growth Rate2006-2007 2007 2006 2005 Salaries and wages 10 % $ 955 $ 872 $ 842 Incentive compensation (1) 10 % 552 504 389 Employee benefits and other 13 % 274 243 218 Total compensation and benefits expense 10 % $ 1,781 $ 1,619 $ 1,449 Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total net revenues: Salaries and wages 19 % 20 % 23 % Incentive compensation 11 % 12 % 11 % Employee benefits and other 6 % 6 % 6 % Total compensation and benefits expense 36 % 38 % 40 % Full-time equivalent employees (in thousands) (2) At year end 7 % 13.3 12.4 11.6 Average 8 % 12.9 11.9 11.3 (1) Includes incentives, discretionary bonus costs, employee stock purchase plan, long-term incentive plan, and stock-based compensation. (2) Includes full-time, part-time and temporary employees, and persons employed on a contract basis, and excludes professional services related to outsourced service providers. The increases in incentive compensation expense from 2005 to 2007 were primarily due to the increased cost of performance-based incentive plans as a result of the Company’s improved financial results and stock-based compensation. For 2007, net revenue growth outpaced compensation and benefits expense growth, resulting in a declining ratio of compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total net revenues. Expenses Excluding Compensation and Benefits The increases in professional services expense from 2005 to 2007 were primarily due to higher levels of fees paid to outsourced service providers and consultants. The increase in occupancy and equipment expense from 2006 to 2007 was due to increases in data processing equipment and maintenance expense of $17 million and occupancy expense of $5 million. The increases in advertising and market development expense from 2005 to 2007 were primarily due to the Company’s media and marketing spending related to its “Talk to Chuck™” national advertising campaign during 2006 and 2007. The increase in communications expense from 2006 to 2007 was due to higher levels of postage and printing costs of $15 million and news and quotes services of $5 million. Other expenses increased from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to increases in regulatory fees of $7 million, bank service charges of $7 million, and charitable contributions of $4 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CSC conducts substantially all of its business through its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The capital structure among CSC and its subsidiaries is designed to provide each entity with capital and liquidity to meet its operational needs and regulatory requirements. On November 15, 2007, Schwab Bank converted its charter from a national association to a federal savings bank. As a result of this conversion, CSC became a savings and loan holding company. As a federal savings bank and - 27 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) savings and loan holding company, respectively, Schwab Bank and CSC are both subject to supervision and regulation by the OTS. Prior to the conversion CSC was a financial holding company, which is a type of bank holding company subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and Schwab Bank was a national association subject to supervision and regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. As a savings and loan holding company, CSC is not subject to the consolidated regulatory capital guidelines applicable to a financial holding company. CSC is required to maintain capital that is sufficient to support the holding company and its subsidiaries’ business activities, and the risks inherent in those activities. To manage capital adequacy, CSC currently utilizes a target Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, as defined by the Federal Reserve Board, of at least 6%. As CSC’s depository institution subsidiary, Schwab Bank is required to maintain a capital level that at least equals minimum capital levels specified in federal banking laws and regulations. Failure to meet the minimum levels will result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct effect on the Bank. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2007 and 2006, Schwab Bank is considered well capitalized. Liquidity CSC CSC’s liquidity needs are generally met through cash generated by its subsidiaries, as well as cash provided by external financing. Schwab and Schwab Bank are subject to regulatory requirements that may restrict them from certain transactions with CSC. Management believes that funds generated by the operations of CSC’s subsidiaries will continue to be the primary funding source in meeting CSC’s liquidity needs, providing adequate liquidity to meet Schwab Bank’s capital guidelines, and maintaining Schwab’s net capital. CSC has liquidity needs that arise from its Senior Medium-Term Notes, Series A (Medium-Term Notes), as well as from the funding of cash dividends, acquisitions, and other investments. In September 2007, CSC issued $250 million of 6.375% Medium-Term Notes due in 2017. The Medium-Term Notes, of which $473 million was outstanding at December 31, 2007, have maturities ranging from 2008 to 2017 and fixed interest rates ranging from 6.38% to 8.05% with interest payable semiannually. The Medium-Term Notes are rated A2 by Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), A by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group (S&P), and A by Fitch IBCA, Inc. (Fitch). CSC has a prospectus supplement on file with the SEC enabling CSC to issue up to $750 million in Senior or Senior Subordinated Medium-Term Notes, Series A. At December 31, 2007, $500 million of these notes remained unissued. CSC has a Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933 on Form S-3 on file with the SEC relating to a universal shelf registration for the issuance of up to $1.0 billion aggregate amount of various securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, and warrants. At December 31, 2007, $700 million of these securities remained unissued. In October 2007, CSC issued $300 million of junior subordinated notes. See “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 12. Borrowings” for a discussion of the junior subordinated notes issued under this registration statement. CSC has authorization from its Board of Directors to issue commercial paper up to the amount of CSC’s committed, unsecured credit facility (see below), not to exceed $1.5 billion. At December 31, 2007, no commercial paper had been issued. CSC’s ratings for these short-term borrowings are P-1 by Moody’s, A-1 by S&P, and F1 by Fitch. CSC maintains an $800 million committed, unsecured credit facility with a group of eighteen banks which is scheduled to expire in June 2008. CSC plans to establish a similar facility to replace this one when it expires. This facility was unused in 2007. Any issuances under CSC’s commercial paper program will reduce the amount - 28 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) available under this facility. The funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes and CSC pays a commitment fee on the unused balance of this facility. The financial covenants in this facility require CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity, Schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, as defined, and Schwab Bank to be well capitalized, as defined. Management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on its ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements. CSC also has direct access to $811 million of the $861 million uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines, provided by eight banks, that are primarily utilized by Schwab to manage short-term liquidity. The amount available to CSC under these lines is lower than the amount available to Schwab because the credit line provided by one of these banks is only available to Schwab. These lines were not used by CSC in 2007. In addition, Schwab provides CSC with a $1.0 billion credit facility maturing in 2009. No funds were drawn under this facility at December 31, 2007. Schwab Most of Schwab’s assets are readily convertible to cash, consisting primarily of short-term (i.e., less than 150 days) investment-grade, interest-earning investments (the majority of which are segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients pursuant to regulatory requirements), receivables from brokerage clients, and receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations. Client margin loans are demand loan obligations secured by readily marketable securities. Receivables from and payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations primarily represent current open transactions, which usually settle, or can be closed out, within a few business days. Liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts, which were $19.5 billion, $19.9 billion, and $24.2 billion at December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for Schwab in the future. The Company has a lease financing liability related to an office building and land under a 20-year lease. The remaining lease financing liability of $121 million at December 31, 2007 is being reduced by a portion of the lease payments over the remaining lease term of approximately 17 years. To manage short-term liquidity, Schwab maintains uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines with a group of eight banks totaling $861 million at December 31, 2007. The need for short-term borrowings arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest-bearing investments, and movements of cash to meet segregation requirements. Schwab used such borrowings for seventeen days in 2007, with daily amounts borrowed averaging $177 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2007. To satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), Schwab has unsecured letter of credit agreements with twelve banks in favor of the OCC aggregating $1.1 billion at December 31, 2007. Schwab pays a fee to maintain these arrangements. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. Schwab satisfies the collateral requirements by arranging letters of credit (LOCs), in favor of these brokerage clients, which are issued by multiple banks. Schwab also pays a fee to maintain these arrangements. At December 31, 2007, the aggregate face amount of these outstanding LOCs totaled $195 million. No funds were drawn under these LOCs at December 31, 2007. Schwab is subject to regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit Schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings to CSC, paying cash dividends, or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent or employees if such payment would result in net capital of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar - 29 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) requirement of $250,000. At December 31, 2007, Schwab’s net capital was $1.2 billion (10% of aggregate debit balances), which was $990 million in excess of its minimum required net capital and $613 million in excess of 5% of aggregate debit balances. To manage Schwab’s regulatory capital requirement, CSC provides Schwab with a $1.4 billion subordinated revolving credit facility which is scheduled to expire in March 2008. Schwab plans to renew this facility when it expires. The amount outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2007 was $220 million. Borrowings under this subordinated lending arrangement qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab. In addition, CSC provides Schwab with a $1.0 billion credit facility maturing in 2009. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab. No funds were drawn under this facility at December 31, 2007. Schwab Bank Schwab Bank’s current liquidity needs are generally met through deposits from banking clients and equity capital. The excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts is swept into a money market deposit account at Schwab Bank. At December 31, 2007, these balances totaled $12.2 billion. Schwab Bank has access to traditional funding sources such as deposits, federal funds purchased, and repurchase agreements. Additionally, CSC provides Schwab Bank with a $100 million short-term credit facility maturing in December 31, 2009. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab Bank. No funds were drawn under this facility at December 31, 2007. Schwab Bank maintains a credit facility with the Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLB). At December 31, 2007, $631 million was available, and no funds were drawn under this facility. Capital Resources The Company monitors both the relative composition and absolute level of its capital structure. Management is focused on limiting the Company’s use of capital and currently targets a long-term debt to total financial capital ratio of less than 30%. The Company’s total financial capital (long-term debt plus stockholders’ equity) at December 31, 2007 was $4.6 billion, down $765 million from December 31, 2006. The decline in the Company’s total financial capital was primarily due to the repurchase of shares under the Tender Offer and Stock Purchase Agreement with Mr. Schwab and certain additional stockholders and the $1.00 per common share special dividend paid in August 2007. The decline was offset by the issuance of $250 million of senior medium-term notes and $300 million of junior subordinated notes, and the gain realized on the sale of U.S. Trust during 2007. At December 31, 2007, the Company had long-term debt of $899 million, or 19% of total financial capital, that bears interest at a weighted-average rate of 7.01%. At December 31, 2006, the Company had long-term debt of $388 million, or 7% of total financial capital. The Company repaid $43 million and $68 million of long-term debt in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company’s cash position (reported as cash and cash equivalents on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet) and cash flows are affected by changes in brokerage client cash balances and the associated amounts required to be segregated under federal or other regulatory guidelines. Timing differences between cash and investments actually segregated on a given date and the amount required to be segregated for that date may arise in the ordinary course of business and are addressed by the Company in accordance with applicable regulations. Other factors which affect the Company’s cash position and cash flows include investment activity in securities, levels of capital expenditures, acquisition and divestiture activity, banking client deposit activity, brokerage and banking client loan activity, financing activity in long-term debt, payments of dividends, and repurchases of CSC’s - 30 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) common stock. The combination of these factors can cause significant fluctuations in the levels of cash and cash equivalents during specific time periods. Capital Expenditures In 2007, the Company’s capital expenditures, net, were $168 million. In 2006, the Company’s capital expenditures were $122 million and the Company sold $63 million of fixed assets, which primarily consisted of a data center. Capital expenditures, net, as a percentage of net revenues totaled 3% and 1% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007 and 2006, capital expenditures were primarily for software and equipment relating to the Company’s information technology systems. Capital expenditures include capitalized costs for developing internal-use software of $57 million in 2007 and $42 million in 2006. Management currently anticipates that 2008 capital expenditures will be approximately 10% higher than 2007 spending, primarily due to increased spending on leasehold improvements and assets relating to the Company’s information technology systems. As has been the case in recent years, the Company may adjust its capital expenditures from period to period as business conditions change. Management believes that funds generated by its operations will continue to be the primary funding source of its capital expenditures. Dividends CSC paid common stock cash dividends of $1.5 billion in 2007, which included a special cash dividend of $1.2 billion. CSC paid common stock cash dividends of $173 million in 2006. Since the initial dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 75 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend 18 times, including a 20% and 67% increase in the second and fourth quarters of 2006, respectively. Since 1989, dividends have increased by a 29% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. CSC paid common stock dividends of $1.200, $.135, and $.089 per share in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, the Company currently targets its cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income. Share Repurchases In 2007, CSC repurchased 135 million shares of its common stock, including shares repurchased under the Tender Offer and Stock Purchase Agreement described below for $2.7 billion. CSC repurchased 52 million shares of its common stock for $859 million in 2006. As of December 31, 2007, CSC had authority to repurchase up to $446 million of its common stock under prior authorization by the Board of Directors. On July 31, 2007, CSC completed a share repurchase through a Tender Offer. CSC accepted for purchase 84 million shares of its common stock at a price of $20.50 per share, for a total purchase price of $1.7 billion. Pursuant to the tender offer rules, CSC was prohibited from making open market repurchases of its common stock during the Tender Offer period and until August 15, 2007. Under the Stock Purchase Agreement executed on July 2, 2007 with Chairman and CEO Charles R. Schwab, CSC’s largest stockholder, and with certain additional stockholders whose shares Mr. Schwab is deemed to beneficially own, CSC purchased 18 million shares at a price of $20.50 per share for a total of $369 million on August 15, 2007. - 31 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Acquisition and Divestiture On July 1, 2007, the Company completed the sale of U.S. Trust to Bank of America and received proceeds of $3.3 billion. On March 31, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of The 401(k) Company for $115 million in cash. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements The Company enters into various off-balance-sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of its clients. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, the Company enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For information on each of these arrangements, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 19. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.” Contractual Obligations A summary of the Company’s principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007 is shown in the following table. Excluded from this table are liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet that are generally short-term in nature (e.g., drafts payable) or without contractual payment terms (e.g., deposits from banking clients, payables to brokerage clients, and deferred compensation). Management believes that funds generated by its continuing operations, as well as cash provided by external financing, will continue to be the primary funding sources in meeting these obligations.

RISK MANAGEMENT Overview The Company’s business activities expose it to a variety of risks including technology and operations risk, credit, market and liquidity risks, and legal and reputational risk. Identification and management of these risks are essential to the success and financial soundness of the Company. Senior management takes an active role in the Company’s risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling various risks. Oversight of risk management has been delegated to the Global Risk Committee, which - 32 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) is comprised of senior managers of major business and control functions. The Global Risk Committee is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the Company’s risk exposures, and leading the continued development of the Company’s risk management policies and practices. Functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report into the Global Risk Committee. These sub-committees include: • Corporate Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee, which focuses on the Company’s liquidity, capital resources, and interest rate risk; • Credit and Market Risk Oversight Committee, which focuses on the credit exposures resulting from client activity (e.g., margin lending activities and loans to banking clients), the investing activities of certain of the Company’s proprietary funds, corporate credit activities (e.g., counterparty and corporate investing activities), and market risk resulting from the Company taking positions in certain securities to facilitate client trading activity; • Technology and Operations Risk Committee, which focuses on the integrity of controls and operating capacity of the Company’s systems and operations processes; • Fiduciary Risk Committee, which oversees activities of the Company with a fiduciary component; • New Products Committee, which addresses risks associated with new products and services; and • Information Security and Privacy Steering Committee, which oversees information security and privacy programs and policies. The Global Risk Committee reports regularly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Audit Committee), which reviews major risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The Company’s Disclosure Committee is responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s (a) disclosure controls and procedures and (b) internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Additionally, the Company’s compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and risk and credit management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring the Company’s risk management. Risk is inherent in the Company’s business. Consequently, despite the Company’s efforts to identify areas of risk, oversee operational areas involving risk, and implement policies and procedures designed to manage risk, there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer unexpected losses due to operating or other risks. The following discussion highlights the Company’s policies and procedures for identification, assessment, and management of the principal areas of risk in its operations. Technology and Operating Risk Technology and operating risk is the potential for loss due to deficiencies in control processes or technology systems that constrain the Company’s ability to gather, process and communicate information and process client transactions efficiently and securely, without interruptions. The Company’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and the Company’s success depends, in part, on its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its technology in anticipation of evolving client needs. To the extent the Company experiences system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to its systems, linkages with third-party systems, and power failures), the Company’s business and operations could be significantly negatively impacted. Additionally, rapid increases in client demand may strain the Company’s ability to enhance its technology and expand its operating capacity. To minimize business interruptions, Schwab has two data centers intended, in part, to further improve the recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency. The Company is committed to an - 33 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) ongoing process of upgrading, enhancing, and testing its technology systems. This effort is focused on meeting client needs, meeting market and regulatory changes, and deploying standardized technology platforms. Technology and operating risk also includes the risk of human error, employee misconduct, external fraud, computer viruses, terrorist attack, and natural disaster. Employee misconduct could include fraud and misappropriation of client or Company assets, improper use or disclosure of confidential client or Company information, and unauthorized activities, such as transactions exceeding acceptable risks or authorized limits. External fraud includes misappropriation of client or Company assets by third parties, including through unauthorized access to Company systems and data and client accounts. The frequency and sophistication of such fraud attempts continue to increase. The Company has specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and uses periodic risk self-assessments and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The Company maintains backup and recovery functions, including facilities for backup and communications, and conducts periodic testing of disaster recovery plans. The Company also maintains policies and procedures and technology to protect against fraud and unauthorized access to systems and data. Despite the Company’s risk management efforts, it is not always possible to deter or prevent technological or operational failure, or fraud or other misconduct, and the precautions taken by the Company may not be effective in all cases. The Company may be subject to litigation, losses, and regulatory actions in such cases, and may be required to expend significant additional resources to remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures. The Company also faces technology and operating risk when it employs the services of various external vendors, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, and support functions. The Company manages its exposure to such outsourcing risks through contractual provisions, control standards, and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance. The Company maintains policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with Company data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-public client information. The Company clearly defines for employees, contractors, and vendors the Company’s expected standards of care for confidential data. Regular training is provided by the Company in regard to data security. The Company is actively engaged in the research and development of new technologies, services, and products. The Company endeavors to protect its research and development efforts, and its brands, through the use of copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and contracts. Credit Risk Credit risk is the potential for loss due to a client or counterparty failing to perform its contractual obligations, or the value of collateral held to secure obligations proving to be inadequate. The Company’s direct exposure to credit risk mainly results from margin lending activities, securities lending activities, mortgage lending activities, its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities, and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds that the Company sponsors. To manage the risks of such losses, the Company has established policies and procedures which include: establishing and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin requirements for certain securities. In addition, most of the Company’s credit extensions, such as margin loans to clients, securities lending agreements, and resale agreements, are supported by collateral arrangements. These arrangements are subject to requirements to provide additional collateral in the event that market fluctuations result in declines in the value of collateral received. Additionally, the Company has exposure to credit risk associated with the Company’s banking loan portfolios held at Schwab Bank. This client credit exposure is actively managed through individual and portfolio reviews performed by management. Management regularly reviews asset quality including concentrations, delinquencies, - 34 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) non-performing loans to banking clients, losses, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses, which is reviewed quarterly by senior management. The Company’s loans to banking client portfolios primarily include first lien 3-, 5- and 7- year adjustable rate mortgage loans (First Mortgage portfolio) of $2.1 billion and home equity lines of credit (HELOC portfolio) of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2007. The Company does not offer loans that allow for negative amortization. The Company maintains credit underwriting standards that have limited the exposure to the types of loans that experienced high foreclosures and loss rates elsewhere in 2007. The Company does not originate or purchase sub prime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a Fair Isaac & Company (FICO) credit score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. At December 31, 2007, approximately 1% of both the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios consisted of loans to borrowers with FICO credit scores of less than 620. The Company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale portfolio. This portfolio includes U.S. agency and non-agency CMOs, corporate debt securities, long term certificates of deposit and U.S. agency notes. The securities available for sale portfolio totaled $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2007. U.S. agency CMOs do not have explicit credit ratings, however management considers these to be rated “AAA” (defined as a rating equivalent to a Moody’s rating of “Aaa” or a Standard and Poor’s rating of “AAA”) based on the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. agencies. At December 31, 2007, the corporate debt securities were not rated lower than investment grade (defined as a rating equivalent to a Moody’s rating of “Baa” or higher, or a Standard and Poor’s rating of “BBB” or higher). Schwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab’s client or a counterparty fails to meet its obligations to Schwab. Concentration Risk The Company is subject to concentration risk when holding large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry. The Company’s investments in mortgage-backed securities including CMOs totaled $6.4 billion at December 31, 2007. Of these, $2.9 billion were U.S. agency securities. The mortgage-backed securities portfolio also includes $768 million of CMOs in which the underlying loans are considered “Alt-A” (defined as loans with reduced documentation at origination) and were rated “AAA”. The Company’s investments in corporate debt securities totaled $784 million at December 31, 2007, with the majority issued by institutions in the financial services industry. The Company’s balance of loans to banking clients, net, totaled $3.4 billion at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, approximately 80% of the First Mortgage portfolio consisted of loans with interest-only payment terms. At December 31, 2007, the interest rates on approximately 80% of these interest-only loans are not scheduled to reset for 3 or more years. At December 31, 2007, 31% of the residential real estate mortgages and 45% of the home equity lines of credit balances were secured by properties which are located in California. The Company is also subject to concentration risk from its margin and securities lending activities collateralized by securities of a single issuer or industry. The Company is subject to indirect exposure to U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral to secure its resale agreements. The Company’s primary credit exposure on these resale transactions is with its counterparty. The Company would have exposure to the U.S. Government and agency securities only in the event of the counterparty’s default on the resale agreements. U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral for resale agreements at December 31, 2007 totaled $2.8 billion. - 35 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Fiduciary Risk Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. The Company attempts to manage this risk by establishing procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various fiduciary risk committees. Legal and Regulatory Risk The Company faces significant legal and compliance risk in its business, and the volume of litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services firms and the amount of damages claimed have been increasing. Among other things, these risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for Company products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of the Company’s controls. Claims against the Company may increase due to a variety of factors, such as if clients suffer losses during a period of deteriorating equity market conditions, as the Company increases the level of advice it provides to clients, and as the Company enhances the services it provides to IAs. In addition, the Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, and SROs, and such regulation is becoming increasingly extensive and complex. The Company attempts to manage legal and compliance risk through policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid litigation claims and prevent or detect violations of applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, client privacy, employment policies, and contracts management. Despite the Company’s efforts to maintain an effective compliance program and internal controls, legal breaches and rule violations could result in reputational harm, significant losses and disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on the Company’s business activities. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. While the majority of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position and reported financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy. Other than Temporary Impairment of Securities Available for Sale: The Company evaluates the determination of other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. The determination of whether or not other-than-temporary impairment exists is a matter of judgment. The evaluation includes the assessment of several factors including: 1) whether the unrealized loss is solely due to changes in interest rates or changes in the credit standing of the issuer, 2) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost, 3) the financial condition of the issuer, 4) the credit ratings of the issuer or security, 5) the collateral underlying the security, and 6) the Company’s intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. If the Company determines other-than-temporary impairment exists, the cost basis of the security is adjusted to the then-current fair value, with a corresponding loss recognized in current earnings. If future evaluations conclude that an impairment now considered to be temporary is other-than temporary, the Company would recognize a realized loss through earnings at that time. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the - 36 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Company’s gross unrealized losses on securities available for sale were $60 million and $28 million, respectively. The Company’s total securities available for sale at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $7.5 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively. Income Tax Benefit Related to the Sale of U.S. Trust: In 2006, the Company recorded a $205 million income tax benefit related to the estimated difference between the tax and book bases of the Company’s U.S. Trust stock. This amount was included in income from discontinued operations, net of tax, on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. This initial estimate of the tax benefit was based on publicly available information, including information on the composition of U.S. Trust’s stockholders at the acquisition date and the market price of U.S. Trust stock during relevant periods, and was subject to adjustment following a survey of former U.S. Trust stockholders. Based upon results of this survey, the Company recorded an additional $72 million income tax benefit in 2007. This tax benefit estimate is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. Valuation of Goodwill: Under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually, or whenever indications of impairment exist. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, resulting in an impairment charge for this excess. The Company has elected April 1 as its annual goodwill impairment testing date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on April 1, 2007, management estimated the fair value of each of the Company’s reporting units (generally defined as the Company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) and compared this value to the carrying value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit was greater than its carrying value, and therefore management concluded that no amount of goodwill was impaired. The estimated fair value of the reporting units was established using a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit. Adverse changes in the Company’s planned business operations such as unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit, or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the Company’s recorded goodwill. The Company’s goodwill balance was $525 million and $419 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Allowance for Credit Losses: The Company regularly evaluates its portfolio of loans to banking clients and provides allowances for the portion management believes may be uncollectible. Several factors are taken into consideration in this evaluation including current economic conditions, the composition of the loan portfolio, past loss experience, and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. For Schwab Bank’s portfolio, which primarily consists of mortgage loans, a risk-based methodology is used to determine the allowance for credit losses. Mortgage loans are categorized into portfolios by loan type and risk characteristics. A probable loss rate, based on company and industry experience, is used to determine the credit allowance. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company’s allowance for credit losses was $7 million and $4 million on loan portfolios of $3.5 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. Legal Reserve: Reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, insurance coverage and indemnification, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved. The Company’s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee. Additionally, management has reviewed with the Audit Committee the Company’s - 37 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) significant estimates discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential for loss due to a change in the value of a financial instrument held by the Company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates or equity prices. For the Company’s market risk related to interest rate fluctuations, it has disclosed below a sensitivity analysis, referred to as a net interest revenue simulation model. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interest-earning assets (mainly margin loans to clients, investments, loans to banking clients, mortgage-backed securities, and other fixed-rate investments) and its funding sources (including brokerage client cash balances, banking deposits, proceeds from stock-lending activities, and long-term debt) which finance these assets. To mitigate the risk of loss, the Company has established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk, and by monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interest-earning assets and funding sources. To remain within these guidelines, the Company manages the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios. The Company also has the ability to adjust the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and certain banking deposits and the rates charged on margin loans. The Company has market risk as a result of fluctuations in equity prices. However, the Company’s exposure to equity prices is not material. Additionally, the Company’s market risk related to financial instruments held for trading, financial instruments held for purposes other than trading, interest rate swaps related to a portion of its fixed interest rate medium-term notes, and forward sale and interest rate lock commitments related to its loans held for sale portfolio is not material. Net Interest Revenue Simulation The Company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulation model (the model) includes all interest-sensitive assets and liabilities, as well as interest rate swap agreements utilized by the Company to hedge its interest rate risk. Key variables in the model include the repricing of financial instruments, prepayment and reinvestment assumptions, and product pricing assumptions. Historically, the Company included additional variables (e.g., changes in the balances of client loans, deposits, brokerage client cash, and changes in the level and term structure of interest rates) in the model assumptions. Effective in 2007 for all periods presented, the Company uses constant balances and market rates in the model assumptions in order to minimize the number of variables and to better isolate risks. The simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline, the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies, including changes in asset and liability mix. As represented by the simulations presented below, the Company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall (i.e., interest-earning assets generally reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities). The simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As the Company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood the Company would take steps to manage any additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment. The following table shows the results of a graduated 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates relative to the Company’s current market rates forecast on simulated net interest revenue over the next twelve months at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Management of the Company focuses on several key financial and non-financial metrics in evaluating the Company’s financial position and operating performance. All information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is presented on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted. Results for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 are shown in the following table: Growth Rate1-year2007-2008 2008 2007 2006 Client Activity Metrics: Net new client assets (in billions) (1, 2) (29 %) $ 113.4 $ 160.2 $ 83.3 Client assets (in billions, at year end) (21 %) $ 1,137.0 $ 1,445.5 $ 1,239.2 Clients’ daily average trades (in thousands) 22 % 346.6 284.9 270.0 Company Financial Metrics: Net revenues 3 % $ 5,150 $ 4,994 $ 4,309 Expenses excluding interest (1 %) 3,122 3,141 2,833 Income from continuing operations before taxes on income 9 % 2,028 1,853 1,476 Taxes on income 9 % (798 ) (733 ) (585 ) Income from continuing operations 10 % 1,230 1,120 891 (Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of tax N/M (18 ) 1,287 336 Net income N/M $ 1,212 $ 2,407 $ 1,227 Earnings per share from continuing operations – diluted 15 % $ 1.06 $ .92 $ .69 Earnings per share – diluted N/M $ 1.05 $ 1.97 $ .95 Net revenue growth from prior year 3 % 16 % 19 % Pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations 39.4 % 37.1 % 34.3 % Return on stockholders’ equity 31 % 55 % 26 % Net revenue per average full-time equivalent employee (in thousands) (1 %) $ 383 $ 387 $ 362 (1) Net new client assets in 2007 includes $23.0 billion related to the acquisition of The 401(k) Company and $3.3 billion related to a mutual fund clearing services client. (2) Effective in 2007, amounts include the Company’s mutual fund clearing services business’ daily net settlements. All prior period amounts have been recast to reflect this change. N/M Not meaningful. • Net new client assets is defined as the total inflows of client cash and securities to the firm less client outflows. Management believes that this metric depicts how well the Company’s products and services appeal to new and existing clients. • Client assets is the market value of all client assets housed at the Company. Management considers client assets to be indicative of the Company’s appeal in the marketplace. Additionally, fluctuations in certain components of client assets (e.g., Mutual Fund OneSource funds) directly impacts asset management and administration fee revenues. • Clients’ daily average trades is an indicator of client engagement with securities markets and the most prominent driver of trading revenues. • Management believes that net revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations, and return on stockholders’ equity provide broad indicators of the Company’s overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns. - 15 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) • Net revenue per average full-time equivalent employee is considered by management to be the Company’s broadest measure of productivity. The Company’s major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue. The Company generates asset management and administration fees through its proprietary and third-party mutual fund offerings, as well as fee-based investment management and advisory services. Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue are impacted by securities valuations, interest rates, the Company’s ability to attract new clients, and client activity levels. The Company generates trading revenues through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenues from trading activity in fixed income securities. Trading revenues are impacted by trading volumes, the volatility of equity prices in the securities markets and commission rates. 2008 Compared to 2007 2008 was marked by extraordinary market conditions, including continued downward pressure on home prices, tighter credit markets, liquidity concerns, significant volatility and sharp declines in the equity markets, and continued slowing of general economic activity. The Nasdaq Composite Index, Standard and Poor’s 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased during the year by 41%, 38%, and 34%, respectively, with a significant portion of these decreases occurring in the fourth quarter. In addition, the federal funds rate decreased during the year by 4.25% to a range of zero to 0.25% at December 31, 2008. Even with this unprecedented market environment, clients remained actively engaged with the Company in managing their investments and made heavy use of all of the Company’s service channels – branch, phone, and internet. Net new client assets totaled $113.4 billion for the year, down 29% from a year ago, reflecting continued deterioration in the equity markets and lower asset valuations. Total client assets were $1.137 trillion at December 31, 2008, down 21% from December 31, 2007. Additionally, clients’ daily average trades increased 22% to 346,600 in 2008 from 2007. Net revenues grew by 3% in 2008 from the prior year primarily due to an increase in trading revenue partially offset by a decrease in other revenue. Trading revenue increased in 2008 primarily due to higher trading volume as a result of significant volatility in the equity markets during the year. The decrease in other revenue in 2008 related to losses of $75 million on investments in the Company’s securities available for sale portfolio. Asset management and administration fees remained relatively flat in 2008 reflecting the Company’s ability to attract and retain clients. Net interest revenue increased by 1% in 2008 due to higher levels of interest-earning assets offset by the impact of a decrease in the average net yield earned on these assets. Although expenses excluding interest remained relatively flat in 2008, compensation and benefits expense decreased reflecting lower incentive compensation, while other expense and occupancy and equipment expense increased. The loss from discontinued operations of $18 million in 2008 relates to the adjustment to finalize the income tax gain related to the sale of U.S. Trust. As a result of the Company’s sustained expense discipline in 2008, the Company achieved a pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations of 39.4% and return on stockholders’ equity of 31% in 2008. Return on stockholders’ equity in 2007 included a $1.2 billion after-tax gain on the sale of U.S. Trust, as well as incremental interest revenue generated from temporarily investing the proceeds from the sale. Net revenue per average full-time equivalent employee was $383,000 in 2008, down 1% from 2007 as net revenue growth was lower than the increase in average full-time equivalent employees. 2007 Compared to 2006 Overall equity market returns for 2007 showed gains for the three major indices – the Nasdaq Composite Index increased by 10%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 6%, and the Standard and Poor’s 500 Index increased 4%. Net new client assets totaled $160.2 billion for 2007, up 92% from 2006, which included $23.0 billion related to the acquisition of The 401(k) Company in 2007. Total client assets were $1.446 trillion at December 31, 2007, up 17% from December 31, 2006. Clients’ daily average trades increased 6% to 284,900 in 2007 from 2006. - 16 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Net revenues grew by 16% in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to an increase in asset management and administration fees driven by growth in client assets, as well as an increase in net interest revenue due to higher interest rate spreads. Expenses excluding interest increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense, advertising and market development expense, and professional services expense. The Company’s pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations was 37.1% in 2007 as compared to 34.3% in 2006 due to revenue growth and disciplined expense management during the year. Return on stockholders’ equity increased to 55% in 2007 as compared to 26% in 2006, reflecting the sale of U.S. Trust, earnings growth, and the Company’s active management of its capital base. Net revenue per average full-time equivalent employee was $387,000 in 2007, up 7% from 2006 due to revenue growth partially offset by the increase in average full-time equivalent employees as a result of the acquisition of The 401(k) Company. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current presentation. All references to EPS information in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reflect diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. CURRENT MARKET ENVIRONMENT The adverse market conditions in 2008 discussed above continue to negatively impact the Company’s revenues. The Company earns mutual fund service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets. Fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue earned by the Company. Continued depressed equity valuations in 2009 will negatively impact asset management and administration fees on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, mutual fund service fees may be further reduced if the current interest rate environment persists. To the extent certain money market mutual funds replace maturing securities with lower yielding securities and the overall yield on such funds falls to a level at or below the management fees on those funds, the Company may waive a portion of its fee in order to continue providing some return to clients. With the recent decline in interest rates, the Company’s revenue from interest-earning assets such as securities held and loans to clients has been declining more than the rates that the Company pays on funding sources such as customer deposits. The Company’s ability to reduce those rates has been limited as short term rates have approached zero. If the current interest rate environment persists through 2009, it will negatively impact net interest revenue on a year-over-year basis. The level at which clients utilize margin loans will also impact net interest revenue. While the average balance of margin loans was $10.3 billion for all of 2008, by month-end December the balance had declined to $6.2 billion. The Company recorded pre-tax losses of $75 million related to two corporate debt securities in its securities available for sale portfolio in 2008. Certain securities available for sale experienced deteriorating credit characteristics in 2008. Further deterioration in the performance of these securities, including non-agency mortgage-backed securities, could result in the recognition of future impairment charges. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion presents an analysis of the Company’s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006. - 17 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Net Revenues The Company’s major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue. Asset management and administration fees were relatively flat, while net interest revenue and trading revenue increased in 2008 as compared to 2007. Asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue increased in 2007 as compared to 2006.

Asset Management and Administration Fees Asset management and administration fees include mutual fund service fees and fees for other asset-based financial services provided to individual and institutional clients. The Company earns mutual fund service fees for transfer agent services, shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. These fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in third-party funds and the Company’s proprietary funds. The Company also earns asset management fees for advisory and managed account services, which are based on the daily balances of client assets subject to the specific fee for service. The fair values of client assets, which include proprietary and third-party mutual funds, are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data. Asset management and administration fees may vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and levels of net new client assets. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees, see “Current Market Environment”. Asset management and administration fees remained relatively flat in 2008 from 2007, primarily due to lower third-party mutual fund and advisory service fees, partially offset by higher proprietary fund fees. Mutual Fund OneSource service fees decreased by $77 million, or 12%, in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to a 39% decline in Schwab’s Mutual Fund OneSource asset balances. The Company’s proprietary mutual fund service fees increased $98 million, or 8%, in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to a 15% increase in money market mutual fund asset balances. Investment management and trust fees decreased by $38 million, or 10%, in 2008 from 2007 due to lower balances of client assets participating in advisory and managed account services programs. Asset management and administration fees increased by $413 million, or 21%, in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to higher mutual fund, advisory, and managed account asset balances. Mutual fund service fees increased $329 million, or 21% in 2007 - 18 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) from 2006 primarily due to a 26% rise in the Company’s proprietary mutual fund asset balances and an 11% increase in asset balances in Schwab’s Mutual Fund OneSource service. Investment management and trust fees increased by $68 million, or 22%, in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to higher balances of client assets participating in advisory and managed account services programs. Net Interest Revenue Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies. The Company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall (i.e., interest-earning assets generally reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities). In the event of falling interest rates, the Company might attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending the maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lock-in asset yields as well as by lowering rates paid to clients on interest-bearing liabilities. Since the Company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients, as well as the rates charged on receivables from brokerage clients, and also controls the composition of its investment securities, it has some ability to manage its net interest spread. However, the spread is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on net interest revenue, see “Current Market Environment”. In clearing its clients’ trades, Schwab holds cash balances payable to clients. In most cases, Schwab pays its clients interest on cash balances awaiting investment, and may invest these funds and earn interest revenue. Receivables from brokerage clients consist primarily of margin loans to brokerage clients. Margin loans are loans made by Schwab to clients on a secured basis to purchase securities. Pursuant to SEC regulations, client cash balances that are not used for margin lending are generally segregated into investment accounts that are maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients. When investing segregated client cash balances, Schwab must adhere to SEC regulations that restrict investments to securities guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, participation certificates, mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association, certificates of deposit issued by U.S. banks and thrifts, and resale agreements collateralized by qualified securities. Additionally, Schwab has established policies for the minimum credit quality and maximum maturity of these investments. Schwab Bank also maintains investment portfolios for liquidity as well as to invest funding from deposits raised in excess of loans to banking clients. Schwab Bank’s securities available for sale include mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, asset-backed securities, and U.S. agency notes. Schwab Bank’s securities held to maturity include asset-backed securities. Schwab Bank lends funds to banking clients primarily in the form of mortgage loans. These loans are largely funded by interest-bearing deposits from banking clients. The Company’s interest-earning assets are financed primarily by brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients. Other funding sources include noninterest-bearing brokerage client cash balances and proceeds from stock-lending activities, as well as stockholders’ equity. The amount of excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts that is swept into money market deposit accounts at Schwab Bank and (through May 2007) at U.S. Trust has increased significantly since the program’s inception in 2003. Average interest-bearing banking deposits increased $7.2 billion, or 59%, to $19.2 billion in 2008 from 2007, and $2.9 billion, or 32%, to $12.0 billion in 2007 from 2006. As a result, the average securities available for sale balances increased $4.4 billion, or 60%, to $11.8 billion in 2008 from 2007, and $1.2 billion, or 20%, to $7.3 billion in 2007 from 2006, while the average balance of loans to banking clients increased $2.0 billion, or 73%, to $4.8 billion in 2008 from 2007, and $629 million, or 29%, to $2.8 billion in 2007 from 2006. - 19 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The following table presents net interest revenue information corresponding to interest-earning assets and funding sources on the consolidated balance sheet: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense AverageYield/Rate AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense AverageYield/Rate AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense AverageYield/Rate Interest-earning assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 5,217 $ 129 2.47 % $ 4,290 $ 223 5.20 % $ 2,450 $ 125 5.10 % Cash and investments segregated 11,223 280 2.49 % 9,991 511 5.11 % 12,758 602 4.72 % Broker-related receivables (1) 428 8 1.87 % 595 27 4.54 % 533 25 4.69 % Receivables from brokerage clients 10,278 612 5.95 % 10,736 859 8.00 % 10,252 837 8.16 % Securities available for sale (2) 11,772 517 4.39 % 7,335 399 5.44 % 6,125 319 5.21 % Securities held to maturity 22 1 5.86 % — — — — — — Loans to banking clients 4,831 227 4.70 % 2,786 169 6.07 % 2,157 128 5.93 % Total interest-earning assets 43,771 1,774 4.05 % 35,733 2,188 6.12 % 34,275 2,036 5.94 % Other interest revenue 134 82 77 Total interest-earning assets $ 43,771 $ 1,908 4.36 % $ 35,733 $ 2,270 6.35 % $ 34,275 $ 2,113 6.16 % Funding sources: Deposits from banking clients $ 19,203 $ 104 0.54 % $ 12,046 $ 238 1.98 % $ 9,135 $ 200 2.19 % Payables to brokerage clients 15,220 55 0.36 % 14,768 329 2.23 % 17,865 426 2.38 % Short-term borrowings 40 1 2.54 % — — — — — — Long-term debt 890 59 6.63 % 531 38 7.16 % 419 29 6.92 % Total interest-bearing liabilities 35,353 219 0.62 % 27,345 605 2.21 % 27,419 655 2.39 % Non-interest bearing funding sources 8,418 8,388 6,856 Other interest expense 24 18 24 Total funding sources $ 43,771 $ 243 0.56 % $ 35,733 $ 623 1.74 % $ 34,275 $ 679 1.98 % Net interest revenue $ 1,665 3.80 % $ 1,647 4.61 % $ 1,434 4.18 % (1) Includes receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations. (2) Amounts have been calculated based on amortized cost. The increases in net interest revenue in the last two years were primarily due to higher average interest-earning assets, including increases in securities available for sale, and loans to banking clients, partially offset by higher average balances on deposits from banking clients. In addition, the increase in net interest revenue in 2008 was also partially offset by a decrease in receivables from brokerage clients, as well as generally lower yields on interest-earning assets. Net interest revenue in 2007 included incremental interest revenue generated from temporarily investing the proceeds from the sale of U.S. Trust. Consistent with declines in general market interest rates prevalent in 2008, the Company experienced declines in the yields of all interest-earning assets during 2008 as compared to 2007 and 2006. Accordingly, the average interest rates on deposits from banking clients and payables to brokerage clients also decreased during 2008 compared to 2007 and 2006. The decline in the average interest rate on long-term debt was due to the additional debt issued at lower interest rates as part of the Company’s capital restructuring in 2007. Certain interest-bearing assets and liabilities of U.S. Trust retained by the Company in 2007 and 2006: The excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts was previously swept into a money market deposit account at U.S. Trust. In May 2007, Schwab terminated this arrangement and moved all of these balances to a similar existing arrangement with Schwab Bank. The interest expense related to these client deposit balances maintained at U.S. Trust is included in interest expense from continuing operations on the Company’s consolidated statements of income for 2007 and 2006. The interest expense was $4 million and $11 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The corresponding interest revenue on the invested cash balances related to these deposits is included in interest revenue from continuing operations on the Company’s consolidated statements of income for 2007 and 2006. The interest revenue was $14 million and $38 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The interest revenue amount was calculated using the Company’s funds transfer pricing methodology. Trading Revenue Trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenues are affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. Principal transaction revenues are primarily - 20 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) comprised of revenues from client fixed income securities trading activity. Factors that influence principal transaction revenues include the volume of client trades, market price volatility, and competitive pressures. Trading revenue increased by $220 million, or 26%, in 2008 from 2007 and $75 million, or 10%, in 2007 from 2006 due to higher daily average revenue trades and higher average revenue earned per revenue trade. As shown in the following table, daily average revenue trades executed by the Company increased 19% in 2008. The increase in daily average revenue trades was due to higher volumes of equity, mutual fund, option, and principal transaction trades. Average revenue earned per revenue trade increased 4% in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to higher average revenue earned per revenue trade for fixed income securities, partially offset by lower average revenue earned per revenue trade for option securities. Average revenue earned per revenue trade increased 4% in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to a higher proportion of equity trading volume outside the Company’s active investor programs.

Other Revenue Other revenue includes realized gains and losses on sales of securities available for sale, service fees, and software maintenance fees. Other revenue decreased by $79 million, or 61%, in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to losses of $75 million related to two corporate debt securities in the Company’s securities available for sale portfolio in 2008. On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (Lehman) filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition and on September 25, 2008, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) seized Washington Mutual Bank. As a result of these events, the Company sold these debt securities in 2008. Expenses Excluding Interest As shown in the table below, expenses excluding interest were relatively flat in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to a decrease in compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by increases in other expense and occupancy and equipment expense. Expenses excluding interest increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense, advertising and market development expense, and professional services expense. Growth Rate2007-2008 2008 2007 2006 Compensation and benefits (6 %) $ 1,667 $ 1,781 $ 1,619 Professional services 3 % 334 324 285 Occupancy and equipment 6 % 299 282 260 Advertising and market development 6 % 243 230 189 Communications 6 % 211 200 180 Depreciation and amortization (3 %) 152 156 157 Other 29 % 216 168 143 Total expenses excluding interest (1 %) $ 3,122 $ 3,141 $ 2,833 Expenses as a percentage of total net revenues: Total expenses excluding interest 61 % 63 % 66 % Advertising and market development 5 % 5 % 4 % - 21 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits expense includes salaries and wages, incentive compensation, and related employee benefits and taxes. Incentive compensation is based on the achievement of specified performance objectives, including revenue growth, profit margin, and EPS, and therefore will fluctuate with these measures. Compensation and benefits expense decreased by $114 million, or 6%, in 2008 from 2007 due to decreases in incentive compensation and employee benefits and other expense, offset by an increase in salaries and wages. Compensation and benefits expense increased by $162 million, or 10%, in 2007 from 2006 due to increases in salaries and wages, incentive compensation, and employee benefits and other expense. The following table shows a comparison of certain compensation and benefits components and employee data: Growth Rate2007-2008 2008 2007 2006 Salaries and wages 7 % $ 1,020 $ 955 $ 872 Incentive compensation (1) (27 %) 402 552 504 Employee benefits and other (11 %) 245 274 243 Total compensation and benefits expense (6 %) $ 1,667 $ 1,781 $ 1,619 Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total net revenues: Salaries and wages 20 % 19 % 20 % Incentive compensation 8 % 11 % 12 % Employee benefits and other 4 % 6 % 6 % Total compensation and benefits expense 32 % 36 % 38 % Full-time equivalent employees (in thousands) (2) At year end 1 % 13.4 13.3 12.4 Average 5 % 13.5 12.9 11.9 (1) Includes incentives, discretionary bonus costs, long-term incentive plan, stock-based compensation, and employee stock purchase plan expense. (2) Includes full-time, part-time and temporary employees, and persons employed on a contract basis, and excludes employees of outsourced service providers. Salaries and wages increased in 2008 from 2007 due to higher severance expense. Incentive compensation decreased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to lower long-term incentive plan compensation, discretionary bonus costs, and variable compensation. Discretionary bonus costs and variable compensation decreased in 2008 from 2007 based on actual performance in 2008. Long-term incentive plan compensation decreased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to the maturity of certain plan units that matured in 2007. Employee benefits and other expense decreased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to a decrease in deferred compensation. Salaries and wages and employee benefit and other expense increased in 2007 from 2006 due to an increase in full-time employees. Incentive compensation increased in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to the increased cost of performance-based incentive plans as a result of the Company’s improved financial results in 2007 and stock-based compensation. Expenses Excluding Compensation and Benefits Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to increases in data processing equipment and maintenance expense of $12 million and occupancy expense of $5 million. Advertising and market development expense increased in 2008 from 2007 due to an increase in media spending related to the Company’s “Talk to Chuck™” national advertising campaign. Communications expense increased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to higher levels of postage and printing costs of $8 million. Other expense increased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to charges of $29 million for individual client complaints and arbitration claims relating to Schwab YieldPlus Fund® investments. - 22 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Professional services expense increased in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to higher levels of fees paid to outsourced service providers and consultants. Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2007 from 2006 due to increases in data processing equipment and maintenance expense of $17 million and occupancy expense of $5 million. Advertising and market development expense increased in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to the Company’s media and marketing spending related to its “Talk to Chuck™” national advertising campaign. Communications expense increased in 2007 from 2006 due to higher levels of postage and printing costs of $15 million and news and quotes services of $5 million. Other expense increased in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to increases in regulatory fees of $7 million, bank service charges of $7 million, and charitable contributions of $4 million. Taxes on Income The Company’s effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was 39.3% in 2008 and 39.6% in both 2007 and 2006. Segment Information The Company provides financial services to individuals, and institutional and corporate clients through three segments – Investor Services (formerly called Schwab Investor Services), Advisor Services (formerly called Schwab Institutional®), and Corporate and Retirement Services (formerly called Schwab Corporate and Retirement Services). The Investor Services segment includes the Company’s retail brokerage and banking operations. The Advisor Services segment provides custodial, trading, and support services to independent investment advisors. The Corporate and Retirement Services segment provides retirement plan services, plan administrator services, stock plan services, and mutual fund clearing services and supports the availability of Schwab proprietary mutual funds on third-party platforms. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments on a pre-tax basis excluding items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges on non-financial assets, discontinued operations, and extraordinary items. Segment assets are not disclosed because the balances are not used for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments. - 23 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Financial information for the Company’s reportable segments is presented in the following table: For the year ended December 31, Growth Rate2007-2008 2008 2007 2006 Investor Services: Net revenues 1 % $ 3,385 $ 3,352 $ 2,940 Expenses excluding interest — (2,107 ) (2,115 ) (1,982 ) Contribution margin 3 % $ 1,278 $ 1,237 $ 958 Advisor Services: Net revenues 12 % $ 1,250 $ 1,121 $ 966 Expenses excluding interest (4 %) (612 ) (639 ) (562 ) Contribution margin 32 % $ 638 $ 482 $ 404 Corporate and Retirement Services: Net revenues — $ 504 $ 506 $ 373 Expenses excluding interest 6 % (389 ) (367 ) (268 ) Contribution margin (17 %) $ 115 $ 139 $ 105 Unallocated and other: Net revenues N/M $ 11 $ 15 $ 30 Expenses excluding interest N/M (14 ) (20 ) (21 ) Contribution margin N/M $ (3 ) $ (5 ) $ 9 Total: Net revenues 3 % $ 5,150 $ 4,994 $ 4,309 Expenses excluding interest (1 %) (3,122 ) (3,141 ) (2,833 ) Contribution margin 9 % $ 2,028 $ 1,853 $ 1,476 N/M Not meaningful. Investor Services Net revenues increased in 2008 by $33 million, or 1%, from 2007 primarily due to increases in trading revenue and net interest revenue, partially offset by the decrease in other revenue. Trading revenue increased due to higher daily average revenue trades. Net interest revenue increased due to higher levels of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the impact of a decrease in the average net yield earned on these assets. The decrease in other revenue was primarily due to losses on investments in the Company’s securities available for sale portfolio. Expenses excluding interest were relatively flat in 2008 as compared to 2007 as a result of lower incentive compensation expense, offset by a charge for individual client complaints and arbitration claims related to Schwab YieldPlus Fund investments in 2008. Net revenues increased in 2007 by $412 million, or 14%, from 2006 due to increases in net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees. Net interest revenue increased due to higher levels of market interest rates and changes in the composition of interest-earning assets, including increases in securities available for sale and loans to banking clients. Asset management and administration fees increased as a result of higher balances of client assets in the Company’s proprietary mutual funds and Mutual Fund OneSource® service, as well as balances participating in advisory and managed account service programs. Expenses excluding interest increased in 2007 by $133 million, or 7%, from 2006 primarily due to higher client servicing and other related expenses, as well as higher market development expense. Advisor Services Net revenues increased in 2008 by $129 million, or 12%, from 2007 due to increases in trading revenue and asset management and administration fees, offset by the decrease in net interest revenue. Trading revenue increased due to higher daily average revenue trades. Asset management and administration fees increased as a result of higher balances of client assets in the Company’s proprietary funds. Net interest revenue decreased due to the impact of a decrease in the average net yield earned on interest-earning assets. Expenses excluding interest decreased in 2008 by $27 million, or 4%, from 2007 primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense. - 24 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Net revenues increased in 2007 by $155 million, or 16%, from 2006 due to increases in asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue. Asset management and administration fees increased as a result of higher balances of client assets in the Company’s proprietary mutual funds and Mutual Fund OneSource® service, as well as balances participating in managed account service programs. Net interest revenue increased due to higher levels of market interest rates and changes in the composition of interest-earning assets, including increases in securities available for sale. Expenses excluding interest increased in 2007 by $77 million, or 14%, from 2006 primarily due to higher business development, marketing and account servicing related expenses, as well as increased infrastructure investment. Corporate and Retirement Services Net revenues were flat in 2008 as compared to 2007 as a result of an increase in trading revenue offset by a decrease in net interest revenue. Trading revenue increased due to higher daily average revenue trades. Net interest revenue decreased due to the impact of a decrease in the average net yield earned on interest-earning assets. Expenses excluding interest increased in 2008 by $22 million, or 6%, from 2007 due to increased costs to service additional corporate retirement plan participants resulting from the acquisition of the 401(k) Company, offset by lower incentive compensation expense. Net revenues increased in 2007 by $133 million, or 36%, from 2006 due to increases in asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue, as well as the acquisition of the 401(k) Company in March 2007. Asset management and administration fees increased as a result of higher balances of client assets in the Company’s mutual funds and advisory and managed account service programs. Net interest revenue increased due to higher levels of market interest rates and changes in the composition of interest-earning assets. Expenses excluding interest increased in 2007 by $99 million, or 37%, from 2006 primarily due to costs to service additional corporate retirement plan participants as a result of the acquisition of the 401(k) Company. Capital Restructuring In 2007, CSC completed a capital restructuring that returned approximately $3.3 billion in capital to stockholders to create a more efficient and cost-effective capital structure. The capital restructuring included the following components: • CSC paid a special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share, which returned $1.2 billion to stockholders. The special dividend was paid on August 24, 2007, to stockholders of record on July 24, 2007. • CSC repurchased 84 million shares of its common stock through a modified “Dutch Auction” tender offer in August 2007. The tender offer period closed on July 31, 2007, and CSC accepted for purchase 84 million shares of its common stock, at a purchase price of $20.50 per share, for a total purchase price of $1.7 billion. • CSC executed a separate Stock Purchase Agreement with Chairman and former CEO Charles R. Schwab, CSC’s largest stockholder, and with certain additional stockholders whose shares Mr. Schwab was deemed to beneficially own. Under the Stock Purchase Agreement, Mr. Schwab and the other stockholders who are parties to the agreement did not participate in the tender offer, but instead, sold, and CSC purchased, 18 million shares, at a purchase price ($20.50 per share), which is the same as was determined and paid in the tender offer, for a total purchase price of $369 million. The number of shares repurchased resulted in Mr. Schwab maintaining the same beneficial percentage interest in CSC’s outstanding common stock that he had prior to the tender offer and sale of shares pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement (approximately 18 percent, which does not take into consideration Mr. Schwab’s outstanding options to acquire stock). The shares under this agreement were repurchased on August 15, 2007. • CSC issued $250 million of 6.375% Senior Medium-Term Notes due in 2017 in September 2007 and $300 million of junior subordinated notes in October 2007. For further discussion of the issuance of the junior subordinated notes, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 12. Borrowings.” Discontinued Operations On July 1, 2007, the Company completed the sale of all of the outstanding common stock of U.S. Trust for $3.3 billion in cash. CSC recognized a gain on the sale of $1.9 billion, or $1.2 billion after tax, in third quarter of 2007. In connection with the determination of the final income tax gain on the sale of U.S. Trust, the Company recorded additional tax expense of - 25 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) $18 million in the second quarter of 2008. U.S. Trust is presented as a discontinued operation for all periods prior to the completion of the sale. Business Acquisition On March 31, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of The 401(k) Company, which offers retirement plan services, for $115 million in cash. As a result of a purchase price allocation, the Company recorded goodwill of $106 million and intangible assets of $8 million. The intangible assets are being amortized over 16 years. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CSC conducts substantially all of its business through its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The capital structure among CSC and its subsidiaries is designed to provide each entity with capital and liquidity to meet its operational needs and regulatory requirements. CSC is a savings and loan holding company and Schwab Bank, CSC’s depository institution, is a federal savings bank. CSC and Schwab Bank are both subject to supervision and regulation by the Office of Thrift Supervision. Liquidity CSC As a savings and loan holding company, CSC is not subject to specific statutory capital requirements. However, CSC is required to maintain capital that is sufficient to support the holding company and its subsidiaries’ business activities, and the risks inherent in those activities. To manage capital adequacy, CSC currently utilizes a target Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board, of at least 6%. At December 31, 2008, CSC’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 8.6%. CSC’s liquidity needs are generally met through cash generated by its subsidiaries, as well as cash provided by external financing. CSC maintains excess liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits to cover daily funding needs and to support growth in the Company’s business. Generally, CSC does not hold liquidity at its subsidiaries in excess of amounts deemed sufficient to support the subsidiaries’ operations, including any regulatory capital requirements. Schwab and Schwab Bank are subject to regulatory requirements that may restrict them from certain transactions with CSC. Management believes that funds generated by the operations of CSC’s subsidiaries will continue to be the primary funding source in meeting CSC’s liquidity needs, providing adequate liquidity to meet Schwab Bank’s capital guidelines, and maintaining Schwab’s net capital. CSC has liquidity needs that arise from its Senior Medium-Term Notes, Series A (Medium-Term Notes), and junior subordinated notes, as well as from the funding of cash dividends, acquisitions, and other investments. The Medium-Term Notes, of which $458 million was outstanding at December 31, 2008, have maturities ranging from 2009 to 2017 and fixed interest rates ranging from 6.375% to 8.05% with interest payable semiannually. The Medium-Term Notes are rated A2 by Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), A by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group (S&P), and A by Fitch IBCA, Inc. (Fitch). At December 31, 2008, $300 million of junior subordinated notes were outstanding and have a fixed interest rate of 7.50% until 2017 and a floating rate thereafter. The junior subordinated notes are not rated, however the trust preferred securities related to these notes are rated A3 by Moody’s, BBB+ by S&P, and A- by Fitch. For further discussion of the issuance of the junior subordinated notes, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 12. Borrowings.” CSC has a universal automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC which enables CSC to issue debt, equity and other securities. This registration statement was filed in December 2008. CSC’s prior shelf registration statement/prospectus supplement for issuing Medium-Term Notes and universal shelf registration statement both expired in November 2008. - 26 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) CSC has authorization from its Board of Directors to issue unsecured commercial paper notes (Commercial Paper Notes) not to exceed $1.5 billion. Management has set a current limit for the commercial paper program of $800 million. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes may vary, but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper is not redeemable prior to maturity and is not subject to voluntary prepayment. The proceeds of the commercial paper program are to be used for general corporate purposes. CSC commenced issuing Commercial Paper Notes in April 2008. Average borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $40 million. There were no Commercial Paper Notes outstanding at December 31, 2008. CSC’s ratings for these short-term borrowings are P-1 by Moody’s, A-1 by S&P, and F1 by Fitch. CSC maintains an $800 million committed, unsecured credit facility with a group of fourteen banks which is scheduled to expire in June 2009. CSC plans to establish a similar facility to replace this one when it expires. This facility was unused in 2008. Any issuances under CSC’s commercial paper program will reduce the amount available under this facility. The funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes, including repayment of the Commercial Paper Notes discussed above. The financial covenants under this facility require Schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, as defined, Schwab Bank to be well capitalized, as defined, and CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity. At December 31, 2008, the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was $2.6 billion. Management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on its ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements. CSC also has direct access to $1.0 billion of the $1.1 billion uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines discussed below, that are primarily utilized by Schwab to manage short-term liquidity. The amount available to CSC under these lines is lower than the amount available to Schwab because the credit line provided by one of these banks is only available to Schwab. These lines were not used by CSC in 2008. In addition, Schwab provides CSC with a $1.0 billion credit facility maturing in 2009. No funds were drawn under this facility at December 31, 2008. Schwab Schwab is subject to regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit Schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings to CSC, paying cash dividends, or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent or employees if such payment would result in net capital of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000. At December 31, 2008, Schwab’s net capital was $1.2 billion (16% of aggregate debit balances), which was $1.1 billion in excess of its minimum required net capital and $840 million in excess of 5% of aggregate debit balances. Most of Schwab’s assets are readily convertible to cash, consisting primarily of short-term (i.e., less than 150 days) investment-grade, interest-earning investments (the majority of which are segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients pursuant to regulatory requirements), receivables from brokerage clients, and receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations. Client margin loans are demand loan obligations secured by readily marketable securities. Receivables from and payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations primarily represent current open transactions, which usually settle, or can be closed out, within a few business days. Liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts, which were $19.2 billion, $19.5 billion, and $19.9 billion at December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for Schwab in the future. The Company has a finance lease obligation related to an office building and land under a 20-year lease. The remaining finance lease obligation of $116 million at December 31, 2008 is being reduced by a portion of the lease payments over the remaining lease term of approximately 16 years. To manage short-term liquidity, Schwab maintains uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines with a group of six banks totaling $1.1 billion at December 31, 2008. The need for short-term borrowings arises primarily from timing differences - 27 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest-bearing investments, and movements of cash to meet segregation requirements. Schwab used such borrowings for eighteen days in 2008, with daily amounts borrowed averaging $117 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2008. To satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), Schwab has unsecured standby letter of credit (LOCs) agreements with seven banks in favor of the OCC aggregating $550 million at December 31, 2008. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. Schwab satisfies the collateral requirements by arranging LOCs, in favor of these brokerage clients, which are issued by multiple banks. At December 31, 2008, the aggregate face amount of these LOCs totaled $100 million. No funds were drawn under any of these LOCs during 2008. To manage Schwab’s regulatory capital requirement, CSC provides Schwab with a $1.4 billion subordinated revolving credit facility which is scheduled to expire in March 2010. The amount outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2008 was $220 million. Borrowings under this subordinated lending arrangement qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab. In addition, CSC provides Schwab with a $1.5 billion credit facility which is scheduled to expire in 2011. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab. At December 31, 2008, $153 million was outstanding under this facility, which was subsequently repaid on January 2, 2009. Schwab Bank Schwab Bank is required to maintain a capital level that at least equals minimum capital levels specified in federal banking laws and regulations. Failure to meet the minimum levels will result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct effect on Schwab Bank. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2008, Schwab Bank is considered well capitalized. Schwab Bank’s regulatory capital and ratios are as follows: Actual Minimum CapitalRequirement Minimum to beWell Capitalized December 31, 2008 Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Tier 1 Capital $ 1,650 15.3 % $ 432 4.0 % $ 647 6.0 % Total Capital $ 1,671 15.5 % $ 863 8.0 % $ 1,079 10.0 % Leverage $ 1,650 6.4 % $ 1,037 4.0 % $ 1,296 5.0 % Tangible Equity $ 1,650 6.4 % $ 518 2.0 % N/A N/A Not applicable. Schwab Bank’s current liquidity needs are generally met through deposits from banking clients and equity capital. The excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts is swept into a money market deposit account at Schwab Bank. At December 31, 2008, these balances totaled $18.4 billion. Additionally, Schwab Bank has access to traditional funding sources such as deposits, federal funds purchased, and repurchase agreements. Schwab Bank has access to short-term funding through the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) discount window. Amounts available under the FRB discount window are dependent on the amount of Schwab Bank’s mortgage-backed securities available for sale that are pledged as collateral. At December 31, 2008, $187 million was available under this arrangement. There were no funds drawn under this arrangement during 2008. Schwab Bank maintains a credit facility with the Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLB). Amounts available under this facility are dependent on the amount of Schwab Bank’s home equity lines of credit that are pledged as collateral. At December 31, 2008, $415 million was available under this facility. There were no funds drawn under this facility during 2008. - 28 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) CSC provides Schwab Bank with a $100 million short-term credit facility which is scheduled to expire in December 2009. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab Bank. No funds were drawn under this facility during 2008. Capital Resources The Company monitors both the relative composition and absolute level of its capital structure. Management is focused on limiting the Company’s use of capital and currently targets a long-term debt to total financial capital ratio of less than 30%. The Company’s total financial capital (long-term debt plus stockholders’ equity) at December 31, 2008 was $4.9 billion, up $313 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008, the Company had long-term debt of $883 million, or 18% of total financial capital, that bears interest at a weighted-average rate of 7.03%. At December 31, 2007, the Company had long-term debt of $899 million, or 19% of total financial capital. The Company repaid $20 million and $43 million of long-term debt in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company’s cash position (reported as cash and cash equivalents on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet) and cash flows are affected by changes in brokerage client cash balances and the associated amounts required to be segregated under regulatory guidelines. Timing differences between cash and investments actually segregated on a given date and the amount required to be segregated for that date may arise in the ordinary course of business and are addressed by the Company in accordance with applicable regulations. Other factors which affect the Company’s cash position and cash flows include investment activity in securities, levels of capital expenditures, acquisition and divestiture activity, banking client deposit activity, brokerage and banking client loan activity, financing activity in long-term debt, payments of dividends, and repurchases of CSC’s common stock. The combination of these factors can cause significant fluctuations in the levels of cash and cash equivalents during specific time periods. Capital Expenditures The Company’s capital expenditures were $196 million in 2008 and $168 million in 2007. Capital expenditures as a percentage of net revenues were 4% and 3% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2008 included software and equipment relating to the Company’s information technology systems, buildings, and leasehold improvements. Capital expenditures in 2007 were primarily for software and equipment relating to the Company’s information technology systems. Capital expenditures include capitalized costs for developing internal-use software of $46 million in 2008 and $57 million in 2007. Management currently anticipates that 2009 capital expenditures will be approximately 25% lower than 2008 spending, primarily due to decreased spending on software relating to the Company’s information technology systems, as well as decreased spending on buildings. As has been the case in recent years, the Company may adjust its capital expenditures from period to period as business conditions change. Management believes that funds generated by its operations will continue to be the primary funding source of its capital expenditures. Dividends CSC paid common stock cash dividends of $253 million in 2008. CSC paid common stock cash dividends of $1.5 billion in 2007, which included a special cash dividend of $1.2 billion. Since the initial dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 79 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend 19 times, including a 20% increase in the third quarter of 2008. Since 1989, dividends have increased by a 28% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. CSC paid common stock dividends of $.220, $1.200, and $.135 per share in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, the Company currently targets its cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income. - 29 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Share Repurchases CSC repurchased 17 million shares of its common stock for $350 million in 2008. CSC repurchased 135 million shares of its common stock, including shares repurchased under the tender offer and the Stock Purchase Agreement described below for $2.7 billion in 2007.

RISK MANAGEMENT Overview The Company’s business activities expose it to a variety of risks including technology and operations risk, credit, market and liquidity risks, and legal and reputational risk. Identification and management of these risks are essential to the success and financial soundness of the Company. Senior management takes an active role in the Company’s risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling various risks. Oversight of risk management has been delegated to the Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior managers of major business and control functions. The Global Risk Committee is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the Company’s risk exposures, and leading the continued development of the Company’s risk management policies and practices. Functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report into the Global Risk Committee. These sub-committees include: • Corporate Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee, which focuses on the Company’s liquidity, capital resources, interest rate risk, and investments; • Credit and Market Risk Oversight Committee, which focuses on the credit exposures resulting from client activity (e.g., margin lending activities and loans to banking clients), the investing activities of certain of the Company’s proprietary funds, corporate credit activities (e.g., counterparty and corporate investing activities), and market risk resulting from the Company taking positions in certain securities to facilitate client trading activity; - 31 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) • Technology and Operations Risk Committee, which focuses on the integrity of controls and operating capacity of the Company’s systems and operations processes; • Fiduciary Risk Committee, which oversees activities of the Company with a fiduciary component; • New Products Committee, which addresses risks associated with new products and services; and • Information Security and Privacy Steering Committee, which oversees information security and privacy programs and policies. The Global Risk Committee reports regularly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Audit Committee), which reviews major risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The Company’s Disclosure Committee is responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s (a) disclosure controls and procedures and (b) internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Additionally, the Company’s compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and risk and credit management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring the Company’s risk management. Risk is inherent in the Company’s business. Consequently, despite the Company’s efforts to identify areas of risk, oversee operational areas involving risk, and implement policies and procedures designed to manage risk, there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer unexpected losses due to operating or other risks. The following discussion highlights the Company’s policies and procedures for identification, assessment, and management of the principal areas of risk in its operations. Technology and Operating Risk Technology and operating risk is the potential for loss due to deficiencies in control processes or technology systems that constrain the Company’s ability to gather, process and communicate information and process client transactions efficiently and securely, without interruptions. The Company’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and the Company’s success depends, in part, on its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its technology in anticipation of evolving client needs. To the extent the Company experiences system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to its systems, linkages with third-party systems, and power failures), the Company’s business and operations could be significantly negatively impacted. Additionally, rapid increases in client demand may strain the Company’s ability to enhance its technology and expand its operating capacity. To minimize business interruptions, Schwab has two data centers intended, in part, to further improve the recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency. The Company is committed to an ongoing process of upgrading, enhancing, and testing its technology systems. This effort is focused on meeting client needs, meeting market and regulatory changes, and deploying standardized technology platforms. Technology and operating risk also includes the risk of human error, employee misconduct, external fraud, computer viruses, terrorist attack, and natural disaster. Employee misconduct could include fraud and misappropriation of client or Company assets, improper use or disclosure of confidential client or Company information, and unauthorized activities, such as transactions exceeding acceptable risks or authorized limits. External fraud includes misappropriation of client or Company assets by third parties, including through unauthorized access to Company systems and data and client accounts. The frequency and sophistication of such fraud attempts continue to increase. The Company has specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and uses periodic risk self-assessments and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The Company maintains backup and recovery functions, including facilities for backup and communications, and conducts periodic testing of disaster recovery plans. The Company also maintains policies and procedures and technology to protect against fraud and unauthorized access to systems and data. - 32 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Despite the Company’s risk management efforts, it is not always possible to deter or prevent technological or operational failure, or fraud or other misconduct, and the precautions taken by the Company may not be effective in all cases. The Company may be subject to litigation, losses, and regulatory actions in such cases, and may be required to expend significant additional resources to remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures. The Company also faces technology and operating risk when it employs the services of various external vendors, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, and support functions. The Company manages its exposure to such outsourcing risks through contractual provisions, control standards, and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance. The Company maintains policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with Company data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-public client information. The Company clearly defines for employees, contractors, and vendors the Company’s expected standards of care for confidential data. Regular training is provided by the Company in regard to data security. The Company is actively engaged in the research and development of new technologies, services, and products. The Company endeavors to protect its research and development efforts, and its brands, through the use of copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and contracts. Credit Risk Credit risk is the potential for loss due to a client or counterparty failing to perform its contractual obligations, or the value of collateral held to secure obligations proving to be inadequate. The Company’s direct exposure to credit risk mainly results from margin lending activities, securities lending activities, mortgage lending activities, its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities, and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds that the Company sponsors. To manage the risks of such losses, the Company has established policies and procedures which include: establishing and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin requirements for certain securities. In addition, most of the Company’s credit extensions, such as margin loans to clients, securities lending agreements, and resale agreements, are supported by collateral arrangements. These arrangements are subject to requirements to provide additional collateral in the event that market fluctuations result in declines in the value of collateral received. The Company’s credit exposure related to loans to banking clients is actively managed through individual and portfolio reviews performed by management. Management regularly reviews asset quality including concentrations, delinquencies, non-performing loans, losses, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses, which is reviewed quarterly by senior management. The Company’s loan portfolios primarily include first lien 3-, 5- and 7-year adjustable rate mortgage loans (First Mortgage portfolio) of $3.2 billion and home equity lines of credit (HELOC portfolio) of $2.7 billion at December 31, 2008. The Company does not offer loans that allow for negative amortization. The Company maintains credit underwriting standards that have limited the exposure to the types of loans that experienced high foreclosures and loss rates elsewhere in the industry during 2008. The Company does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a Fair Isaac & Company (FICO) credit score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. At December 31, 2008, approximately 1% of both the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios consisted of loans to borrowers with FICO credit scores of less than 620. - 33 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The following table presents certain of the Company’s loan quality metrics as a percentage of total outstanding loans: December 31, 2008 2007 Loan delinquencies (1) 0.54 % 0.80 % Nonaccrual loans 0.13 % 0.12 % Allowance for credit losses 0.33 % 0.20 % (1) Loan delinquencies are defined as loans that are 30 days or more past due. The Company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale portfolio, which totaled $14.4 billion at December 31, 2008. This portfolio includes U.S. agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt securities, long term certificates of deposit, asset-backed securities and U.S. agency notes. U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings, however management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. agencies. Included in non-agency mortgage-backed securities are securities collateralized by loans that are considered to be “Prime” (defined by the Company as loans to borrowers with a FICO credit score of 620 or higher at origination), and “Alt-A” (defined by the Company as Prime loans with reduced documentation at origination). The table below presents the credit ratings for U.S. agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, including prime and Alt-A mortgage-backed securities by year of origination. In some instances securities have divergent ratings from Moody’s, Fitch Ratings or Standard and Poor’s. In these instances the Company has used the lowest rating as of December 31, 2008 for purposes of presenting the table below. Mortgage-backed securities, particularly Alt-A securities, experienced deteriorating credit characteristics, including increased delinquencies, and valuation pressure in 2008.

Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab’s client or a counterparty fails to meet its obligations to Schwab. Concentration Risk The Company is subject to concentration risk when holding large positions of financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry. The Company’s investments in mortgage-backed securities totaled $10.4 billion at December 31, 2008. Of these, $8.2 billion were U.S. agency securities and $2.2 billion were non-agency securities. Included in non-agency mortgage-backed securities are securities collateralized by Alt-A loans. At December 31, 2008, the amortized cost and fair value of Alt-A mortgage-backed securities were $798 million and $429 million, respectively. The Company’s investments in corporate debt securities and commercial paper totaled $3.5 billion at December 31, 2008, with the majority issued by institutions in the financial services industry. Included in corporate debt securities and commercial paper at December 31, 2008, were $2.6 billion of securities issued by financial institutions and guaranteed under the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. These corporate debt securities and commercial paper are included in securities available for sale and cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s loans to banking clients includes $3.2 billion of first lien residential real estate mortgage loans at December 31, 2008. Approximately 80% of these mortgages consisted of loans with interest-only payment terms. The interest rates on approximately 80% of these interest-only loans are not scheduled to reset for three or more years. All interest-only loans are underwritten based on underwriting standards that do not include interest terms described as temporary introductory rates below current market rates. At December 31, 2008, 33% of the residential real estate mortgages and 46% of the home equity lines of credit balances were secured by properties which are located in California. The Company is also subject to concentration risk from its margin and securities lending activities collateralized by securities of a single issuer or industry. The Company is subject to indirect exposure to U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral to secure its resale agreements. The Company’s primary credit exposure on these resale transactions is with its counterparty. The Company would have exposure to the U.S. Government and agency securities only in the event of the counterparty’s default on the resale agreements. U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral for resale agreements, at December 31, 2008, totaled $6.8 billion. Market Risk Market risk is the potential for changes in revenue or the value of financial instruments held by the Company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices or market conditions. For discussion of the Company’s market risk, see “Item 7A – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” Fiduciary Risk Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. The Company attempts to manage this risk by establishing procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various fiduciary risk committees. - 35 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Legal and Regulatory Risk The Company faces significant legal and compliance risk in its business, and the volume of litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services firms and the amount of damages claimed have been increasing. Among other things, these risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for Company products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of the Company’s controls. Claims against the Company may increase due to a variety of factors, such as if clients suffer losses during a period of deteriorating equity market conditions, as the Company increases the level of advice it provides to clients, and as the Company enhances the services it provides to IAs. In addition, the Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, and SROs, and such regulation is becoming increasingly extensive and complex. The Company attempts to manage legal and compliance risk through policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid litigation claims and prevent or detect violations of applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, client privacy, employment policies, and contracts management. Despite the Company’s efforts to maintain an effective compliance program and internal controls, legal breaches and rule violations could result in reputational harm, significant losses and disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on the Company’s business activities. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company uses fair value measurements to record certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 157 – Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157), and to determine fair value disclosures. At December 31, 2008, 42% of total assets ($21.9 billion) were recorded at fair value. All of these assets were measured at fair value using quoted prices or market-based information and accordingly were classified as Level 1 or Level 2 measurements in accordance with SFAS No. 157. Liabilities recorded at fair value were not material at December 31, 2008. See note “15 – Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities” for more information on the Company’s assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value. The Company uses prices obtained from an independent third-party pricing service to measure the fair value of certain investment securities. The Company validates prices received from the pricing service using various methods including, comparison to prices received from additional pricing services, comparison to available quoted market prices, internal valuation models, and review of other relevant market data including implied yields of major categories of securities. The Company does not adjust the prices received from the independent third-party pricing service unless such prices are inconsistent with SFAS No. 157 and result in a material difference in the recorded amounts. At December 31, 2008, the Company did not adjust prices received from the independent third-party pricing service. For certificates of deposits and treasury securities included in investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes, the Company uses discounted cash-flow models to measure the fair value that utilize market-based inputs including observable market interest rates that correspond to the remaining maturities or next interest reset dates. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. While the majority of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position and reported financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy. - 36 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Other- than-Temporary Impairment of Securities Available for Sale and Securities Held to Maturity: Management evaluates securities available for sale and securities held to maturity for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. For debt securities, other-than-temporary impairment exists if management determines it is probable that the Company will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the security. Other-than-temporary impairment also exists if management no longer has the ability or intent to hold a security with an unrealized loss for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. If management determines other-than temporary impairment exists, the cost basis of the security is adjusted to the then-current fair value, with a corresponding loss recognized in current earnings. If future evaluations conclude that an impairment now considered to be temporary is other-than-temporary, the Company would recognize a realized loss through earnings at that time. The evaluation of whether other-than-temporary impairment exists is a matter of judgment. The evaluation includes the assessment of several factors including: 1) whether the unrealized loss is solely due to changes in interest rates, 2) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost, 3) the financial condition of the issuer, if applicable, 4) the credit ratings of the issuer or security, 5) the credit characteristics of the collateral underlying the security, including the credit default experience, delinquency rates, cumulative losses to date and the ratio of credit enhancement available under the terms of the security to expected losses for non-agency mortgage-backed securities, and 6) the Company’s intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. Additionally, management utilizes cash flow models for securities that exhibit deteriorating credit characteristics to estimate the expected cash flow from the securities in order to assess whether it is probable that the Company will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the security. These cash flow models require management to estimate future principal prepayments, default rates, and default loss severities based on underlying collateral, and future housing price changes. Further deterioration of these characteristics could result in the recognition of other-than-temporary impairment. Valuation of Goodwill: Under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually, or whenever indications of impairment exist. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, resulting in an impairment charge for this excess. The Company has elected April 1 st as its annual goodwill impairment testing date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on April 1, 2008, management estimated the fair value of each of the Company’s reporting units (generally defined as the Company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) and compared this value to the carrying value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit was greater than its carrying value, and therefore management concluded that no amount of goodwill was impaired. The estimated fair value of the reporting units was established using a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit. Adverse changes in the Company’s planned business operations such as unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit, or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the Company’s recorded goodwill. Allowance for Credit Losses: The Company regularly evaluates its portfolio of loans to banking clients and provides allowances for the portion management believes may be uncollectible. Several factors are taken into consideration in this evaluation including current economic conditions, the composition of the loan portfolio, past loss experience, and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. For Schwab Bank’s portfolio, which primarily consists of mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit, a risk-based methodology is used to determine the allowance for credit losses. Loans are categorized into portfolios by loan type and risk characteristics. A probable loss rate, based on company and industry experience, is used to determine the credit allowance. Legal Reserve: Reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, insurance coverage and indemnification, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are - 37 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved. The Company’s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee. Additionally, management has reviewed with the Audit Committee the Company’s significant estimates discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Certain of these factors, as well as general risk factors affecting the Company, are discussed in greater detail in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Item 1A – Risk Factors.” - 39 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential for changes in revenue or the value of financial instruments held by the Company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices or market conditions. For the Company’s market risk related to interest rates, a sensitivity analysis, referred to as a net interest revenue simulation model, is shown below. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources which finance these assets. Net interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may re-price at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short and long term interest rates. Interest earning-assets include residential real estate loans and mortgage backed securities. These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and to changes to prepayment levels, which tend to increase in a declining rate environment. To mitigate the risk of loss, the Company has established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk, and monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interest-earning assets and funding sources. To remain within these guidelines, the Company manages the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of its investment portfolios. Because the Company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients, the rates charged on margin loans, and controls the composition of its investment securities, it has some ability to manage its net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions. The Company is also subject to market risk as a result of fluctuations in equity prices. The Company’s direct holdings of equity securities and its associated exposure to equity prices are not material. The Company is indirectly exposed to equity market fluctuations in connection with securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers, and customer securities loaned out as part of the Company’s securities lending activities. Equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity, margin borrowing, and overall client engagement with the Company. Additionally, the Company earns mutual fund service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets. Fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue earned by the Company. Financial instruments held by the Company are also subject to liquidity risk – that is, the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument. Recent conditions in the credit markets have significantly reduced market liquidity in a wide range of financial instruments, including the types of instruments held by the Company, and fair value can differ significantly from the value implied by the credit quality and actual performance of the instrument’s underlying cash flows. Financial instruments held by the Company are also subject to valuation risk as a result of changes in valuations of the underlying collateral, such as housing prices in the case of residential real estate loans and mortgage-backed securities. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees, net interest, and securities available for sale, see “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Current Market Environment”. The Company’s market risk related to financial instruments held for trading, interest rate swaps related to a portion of its fixed interest rate medium-term notes, and forward sale and interest rate lock commitments related to its loans held for sale portfolio is not material. Net Interest Revenue Simulation The Company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulation model (the model) includes all interest-sensitive assets and liabilities, as well as interest rate swap agreements utilized by the Company to hedge its interest rate risk. Key variables in the model include the repricing of financial instruments, prepayment and reinvestment assumptions, and product pricing assumptions. The Company uses - 40 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION constant balances and market rates in the model assumptions in order to minimize the number of variables and to better isolate risks. The simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies, including changes in asset and liability mix. As represented by the simulations presented below, the Company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall (i.e., interest-earning assets generally reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities). The simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As the Company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood the Company would take steps to manage any additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment. The following table shows the results of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to the Company’s current market rates forecast on simulated net interest revenue over the next 12 months at December 31, 2008 and 2007. While the Company typically uses a gradual 200 basis point change, it revised the methodology at March 31, 2008 due to the current low levels of interest rates. The Company will use a gradual 100 basis point change until such time as the level of interest rates justifies a return to the previous methodology. December 31, 2008 2007 Increase of 100 basis points 6.4 % 4.4 % Decrease of 100 basis points (6.8 %) (3.1 %) The sensitivity shown in the 100 basis point decrease scenario reflects the fact that the rates paid on brokerage client cash balances and banking deposits had reached minimal levels by year-end 2008. With liability costs essentially fixed, lower rates earned on interest-bearing assets would have a direct impact on net interest income. The Company remains positioned to experience increases in net interest revenue as rates rise and decreases as rates fall. - 41 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION",2023-12-30 18:56:13.948677

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Management of the Company focuses on several key financial and non-financial metrics in evaluating the Company’s financial position and operating performance. All information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is presented on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted. Summarized results for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 are shown in the following table: Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate1-Year2008-2009 2009 2008 2007 Client Activity Metrics: Net new client assets (in billions) (1) (23 %) $ 87.3 $ 113.4 $ 160.2 Client assets (in billions, at year end) 25 % $ 1,422.6 $ 1,137.0 $ 1,445.5 Clients’ daily average trades (in thousands) (4 %) 333.6 346.6 284.9 Company Financial Metrics: Net revenues (19 %) $ 4,193 $ 5,150 $ 4,994 Expenses excluding interest (7 %) 2,917 3,122 3,141 Income from continuing operations before taxes on income (37 %) 1,276 2,028 1,853 Taxes on income (39 %) (489 ) (798 ) (733 ) Income from continuing operations (36 %) 787 1,230 1,120 (Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of tax N/M — (18 ) 1,287 Net income (35 %) $ 787 $ 1,212 $ 2,407 Earnings per share from continuing operations – diluted (36 %) $ .68 $ 1.06 $ .92 Earnings per share – diluted (35 %) $ .68 $ 1.05 $ 1.96 Net revenue (decline) growth from prior year (19 %) 3 % 16 % Pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations 30.4 % 39.4 % 37.1 % Return on stockholders’ equity 17 % 31 % 55 % Net revenue per average full-time equivalent employee (in thousands) (12 %) $ 338 $ 383 $ 387 (1) Net new client assets in 2007 includes $23.0 billion related to the acquisition of The 401(k) Company and $3.3 billion related to a mutual fund clearing services client. N/M Not meaningful. • Net new client assets is defined as the total inflows of client cash and securities to the firm less client outflows. Management believes that this metric depicts how well the Company’s products and services appeal to new and existing clients. • Client assets is the market value of all client assets housed at the Company. Management considers client assets to be indicative of the Company’s appeal in the marketplace. Additionally, fluctuations in certain components of client assets (e.g., Mutual Fund OneSource funds) directly impacts asset management and administration fee revenues. • Clients’ daily average trades is an indicator of client engagement with securities markets and the most prominent driver of trading revenues. • Management believes that earnings per share, net revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations, and return on stockholders’ equity provide broad indicators of the Company’s overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns within the context of a given operating environment. • Net revenue per average full-time equivalent employee is considered by management to be the Company’s broadest measure of productivity. - 15 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The Company’s major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue. The Company generates asset management and administration fees through its proprietary and third-party mutual fund offerings, as well as fee-based investment management and advisory services. Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue are impacted by securities valuations, interest rates, the Company’s ability to attract new clients, and client activity levels. The Company generates trading revenues through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenues from trading activity in fixed income securities. Trading revenues are impacted by trading volumes, the volatility of prices in the equity and fixed income markets, and commission rates. 2009 Compared to 2008 Economic and market conditions remained challenging throughout 2009, marked by unprecedented market dynamics including further declines in short-term interest rates and home valuations, increases in home foreclosures and delinquencies, and tight credit markets. While the federal funds target rate remained unchanged at a range of zero to 0.25%, the three-month LIBOR decreased by 158 basis points to 0.25%. At the same time, although the equity markets showed sustained improvement from their March 2009 lows – the Nasdaq Composite Index, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased during the year by 44%, 24%, and 19%, respectively – average equity market valuations declined in 2009 from 2008. In this shifting market environment, clients continued to actively utilize the Company’s products and services. The Company attracted $87.3 billion in net new client assets during the year. Total client assets were $1.42 trillion at December 31, 2009, up 25% from the prior year, reflecting the Company’s success in continuing to attract and retain clients. Client trading activity slowed modestly during the year as clients’ daily average trades decreased 4% to 333,600 in 2009 from 2008. Net revenues decreased by 19% in 2009 from 2008, primarily due to the decreases in asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue. Asset management and administration fees decreased in 2009 primarily due to money market mutual fund fee waivers and lower average equity market valuations. Given the low interest rate environment, the overall yields on certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds have fallen to levels at or below the management fees on those funds. As a result, the Company waived a portion of its fees which totaled $224 million in order to provide a positive return to clients. There were no money market mutual fund fee waivers in 2008 or 2007. Net interest revenue decreased as a result of the low interest rate environment, partially offset by higher average balances of interest-earning assets. These decreases were offset by the increase in other revenue. Other revenue in 2009 included a $31 million gain on the repurchase of a portion of the Company’s long-term debt. In addition, other revenue in 2008 included a loss of $29 million on the sale of a corporate debt security held in the Company’s available for sale portfolio. Net revenues were also negatively impacted by net impairment charges of $60 million in 2009 relating to certain residential mortgage-backed securities in the Company’s available for sale portfolio. Net impairment losses on securities in 2008 included an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $44 million related to a corporate debt security held in the Company’s available for sale portfolio. Expenses excluding interest decreased by 7% in 2009 from 2008, primarily due to the decreases in compensation and benefits, professional services, and advertising and market development expenses. The decrease in expenses was partially offset by severance and facilities charges of $101 million relating to the Company’s cost reduction measures and a $16 million Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) special industry assessment. As a result of the Company’s cost reduction measures and ongoing expense discipline, the Company achieved a pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations of 30.4% and return on stockholders’ equity of 17% in 2009. Net revenue per average full-time equivalent employee was $338,000 in 2009, down 12% from 2008 due to lower net revenues, partially offset by the decrease in average full-time equivalent employees. 2008 Compared to 2007 2008 was also marked by extraordinary market conditions, including downward pressure on home prices, tight credit markets, liquidity concerns, significant volatility and sharp declines in the equity markets, and slow general economic activity. The - 16 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Nasdaq Composite Index, Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased in 2008 by 41%, 38%, and 34%, respectively, with a significant portion of these decreases occurring in the fourth quarter. In addition, the federal funds target rate decreased during 2008 by 4.25% to a range of zero to 0.25% at December 31, 2008. Net new client assets totaled $113.4 billion for 2008, down 29% from 2007, reflecting deterioration in the equity markets and lower asset valuations. Total client assets were $1.14 trillion at December 31, 2008, down 21% from December 31, 2007. Additionally, clients’ daily average trades increased 22% to 346,600 in 2008 from 2007. Net revenues grew by 3% in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to an increase in trading revenue, partially offset by a decrease in other revenue, as well as net impairment losses on securities incurred in 2008. Trading revenue increased in 2008 primarily due to higher trading volume as a result of significant volatility in the equity markets during the year. The decrease in other revenue related to a loss of $29 million on the sale of a corporate debt security and net impairment losses on securities included an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $44 million related to another corporate debt security, which were held in the Company’s available for sale portfolio. Asset management and administration fees remained relatively flat in 2008, reflecting the Company’s ability to attract and retain clients. Net interest revenue increased slightly in 2008 due to higher levels of interest-earning assets offset by the impact of a decrease in the average net yield earned on these assets. Although expenses excluding interest remained relatively flat in 2008, compensation and benefits expense decreased reflecting lower incentive compensation, while other expense and occupancy and equipment expense increased. The loss from discontinued operations of $18 million in 2008 relates to the adjustment to finalize the income tax gain related to the sale of U.S. Trust. The Company’s pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations was 39.4% and return on stockholders’ equity was 31% in 2008, which reflected the Company’s sustained expense discipline during the year. Return on stockholders’ equity in 2007 included a $1.2 billion after-tax gain on the sale of U.S. Trust, as well as incremental interest revenue generated from temporarily investing the proceeds from the sale. Net revenue per average full-time equivalent employee was $383,000 in 2008, down 1% from 2007 as net revenue growth was lower than the increase in average full-time equivalent employees. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. All references to EPS information in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reflect diluted EPS unless otherwise noted. Subsequent Event On January 26, 2010, the Company completed the sale of 29,670,300 shares of its common stock, $.01 par value, at a public offering price of $19.00 per share. Net proceeds received from the offering were $543 million and will be used to support the Company’s balance sheet growth, including expansion of its deposit base and potential migration of certain client balances from money market funds into Schwab Bank. CURRENT MARKET ENVIRONMENT The difficult market conditions in 2009 continue to adversely affect the Company’s net revenues. While the Company generally earns asset management and administration fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets, these fees are currently being affected by the low interest rate environment as well. The overall yields on certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds have fallen to levels at or below the management fees on those funds. The Company continues to waive a portion of its management fees, which it began to do in the first quarter of 2009, so that the funds may continue providing a positive return to clients. These and other money market mutual funds may continue to find it necessary to replace maturing securities with lower yielding securities as a result of the current interest rate environment and the overall yield on such funds may fall below or further below the management fees on those funds. To the extent this occurs, the amount of fees waived may increase from fourth quarter 2009 levels, which would adversely affect asset management and administration fees. - 17 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Given the low interest rate environment, the Company’s revenue from interest-earning assets, such as securities held and loans to clients, was declining more than the interest that the Company pays on funding sources, such as client deposits. The Company’s ability to reduce the interest expense paid on funding sources has been limited as the rates paid on funding sources, which are largely tied to shorter-term interest rates, approached zero. Concurrently, interest-earning asset yields, which are often tied to longer-term interest rates, continued to decline. By the end of 2009, however, the pace of further declines in interest-earning asset yields had slowed significantly. The Company recorded net impairment charges of $60 million related to certain non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities in 2009 due to credit deterioration of the securities’ underlying collateral. Further deterioration in the performance of the underlying loans in the Company’s residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio could result in the recognition of additional future impairment charges. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion presents an analysis of the Company’s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007. Net Revenues The Company’s major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue. Asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue decreased in 2009 as compared to 2008. Asset management and administration fees were relatively flat, while net interest revenue and trading revenue increased in 2008 as compared to 2007.

The Company earns mutual fund service fees for shareholder services, administration, investment management, and transfer agent services (through July 2009) provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. These fees are based upon the daily balances of client - 18 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) assets invested in the Company’s proprietary funds and third-party funds. The Company also earns asset management fees for advisory and managed account services, which are based on the daily balances of client assets subject to the specific fee for service. The fair values of client assets included in proprietary and third-party mutual funds are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data. Asset management and administration fees may vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees, see “Current Market Environment.” As shown in the following table, asset management and administration fees decreased by $480 million, or 20%, in 2009 from 2008. This decrease was due to decreases in mutual fund service fees and investment management and trust fees. Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate2008-2009 2009 2008 2007 Asset management and administration fees before money market mutual fund fee waivers (11 %) $ 2,099 $ 2,355 $ 2,358 Money market mutual fund fee waivers N/M (224 ) — — Asset management and administration fees (20 %) $ 1,875 $ 2,355 $ 2,358 N/M Not meaningful. Mutual fund service fees decreased by $414 million, or 22%, in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to money market mutual fund fee waivers. Given the low interest rate environment in 2009, the overall yields on certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds have fallen to levels at or below the management fees on those funds. As a result, the Company waived a portion of its fees which totaled $224 million in 2009 in order to provide a positive return to clients. There were no money market mutual fund fee waivers in 2008 or 2007. In addition, mutual fund service fees decreased during the year due to lower average balances of client assets invested in the Company’s Mutual Fund OneSource funds and mutual fund clearing services as a result of lower average equity market valuations. Investment management and trust fees decreased by $67 million, or 20%, in 2009 from 2008 due to temporary fee rebates offered to qualifying clients for choosing to participate in advisory or managed account services programs. Asset management and administration fees remained relatively flat in 2008 from 2007, primarily due to lower third-party mutual fund and advisory service fees, partially offset by higher proprietary fund fees. Mutual Fund OneSource service fees decreased by $77 million, or 12%, in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to lower average balances of client assets invested in the Company’s Mutual Fund OneSource funds. The Company’s proprietary mutual fund service fees increased $98 million, or 8%, in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to higher average balances of client assets invested in the Company’s money market mutual funds. Investment management and trust fees decreased by $38 million, or 10%, in 2008 from 2007 due to lower average balances of client assets participating in advisory and managed account services programs. Net Interest Revenue Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies. The Company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall (i.e., interest-earning assets generally reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities). When interest rates fall, the Company attempts to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending the maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lock-in asset yields as well as by lowering rates paid to clients on interest-bearing liabilities. Since the Company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients, as well as the rates charged on receivables from brokerage clients, and also controls the composition of its investment securities, it has some ability to manage its net interest spread. However, the spread is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on net interest revenue, see “Current Market Environment.” - 19 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) In clearing its clients’ trades, Schwab holds cash balances payable to clients. In most cases, Schwab pays its clients interest on cash balances awaiting investment, and may invest these funds and earn interest revenue. Receivables from brokerage clients consist primarily of margin loans to brokerage clients. Margin loans are loans made by Schwab to clients on a secured basis to purchase securities. Pursuant to SEC regulations, client cash balances that are not used for margin lending are generally segregated into investment accounts that are maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients, which are recorded in cash and investments segregated on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. When investing segregated client cash balances, Schwab must adhere to SEC regulations that restrict investments to securities guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, participation certificates, mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association, certificates of deposit issued by U.S. banks and thrifts, and resale agreements collateralized by qualified securities. Additionally, Schwab has established policies for the minimum credit quality and maximum maturity of these investments. Schwab Bank also maintains investment portfolios for liquidity as well as to invest funding from deposits raised in excess of loans to banking clients. Schwab Bank’s securities available for sale include residential mortgage-backed securities, U.S. agency notes, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, and asset-backed securities. Schwab Bank’s securities held to maturity include residential mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, and corporate debt securities. Schwab Bank lends funds to banking clients primarily in the form of mortgage loans. These loans are largely funded by interest-bearing deposits from banking clients. The Company’s interest-earning assets are financed primarily by brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients. Non-interest bearing funding sources include noninterest-bearing brokerage client cash balances and proceeds from stock-lending activities, as well as stockholders’ equity. The following table presents net interest revenue information corresponding to interest-earning assets and funding sources on the consolidated balance sheet: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense AverageYield/Rate AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense AverageYield/Rate AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense AverageYield/Rate Interest-earning assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 7,848 $ 33 0.42 % $ 5,217 $ 129 2.47 % $ 4,290 $ 223 5.20 % Cash and investments segregated 16,291 80 0.49 % 11,223 280 2.49 % 9,991 511 5.11 % Broker-related receivables (1) 363 1 0.28 % 428 8 1.87 % 595 27 4.54 % Receivables from brokerage clients 6,749 351 5.20 % 10,278 612 5.95 % 10,736 859 8.00 % Other securities owned 126 1 0.79 % — — — — — — Securities available for sale (2) 18,558 521 2.81 % 11,772 517 4.39 % 7,335 399 5.44 % Securities held to maturity 1,915 74 3.86 % 22 1 5.86 % — — — Loans to banking clients 6,671 241 3.61 % 4,831 227 4.70 % 2,786 169 6.07 % Loans held for sale 110 5 4.55 % 66 4 6.06 % 37 2 5.41 % Total interest-earning assets 58,631 1,307 2.23 % 43,837 1,778 4.06 % 35,770 2,190 6.12 % Other interest revenue 121 130 80 Total interest-earning assets $ 58,631 $ 1,428 2.44 % $ 43,837 $ 1,908 4.35 % $ 35,770 $ 2,270 6.35 % Funding sources: Deposits from banking clients $ 31,249 $ 107 0.34 % $ 19,203 $ 104 0.54 % $ 12,046 $ 238 1.98 % Payables to brokerage clients 18,002 3 0.02 % 15,220 55 0.36 % 14,768 329 2.23 % Short-term borrowings — — — 40 1 2.54 % — — — Long-term debt 1,231 71 5.77 % 890 59 6.63 % 531 38 7.16 % Total interest-bearing liabilities 50,482 181 0.36 % 35,353 219 0.62 % 27,345 605 2.21 % Non-interest bearing funding sources 8,149 8,484 8,425 Provision for credit losses 38 17 3 Other interest expense 2 7 15 Total funding sources $ 58,631 $ 221 0.38 % $ 43,837 $ 243 0.55 % $ 35,770 $ 623 1.74 % Net interest revenue $ 1,207 2.06 % $ 1,665 3.80 % $ 1,647 4.61 % (1) Includes receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations.

As a result, the Company experienced declines in the yields and rates of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing - 20 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) liabilities compared to 2008, with yields on interest-earning assets declining more than the cost of funding sources as short-term interest rates approached zero. The mix of interest-earning assets also negatively affected net interest revenue – most notably the decrease in average margin loans resulted in higher average balances of cash and investments segregated, a lower yielding asset category. The effect of the low interest rate environment and asset mix was partially offset by the growth in average balances. The Company experienced significant growth in deposits from banking clients, which in turn funded increases in the average balances of securities available for sale, loans to banking clients, and cash and cash equivalents. Net interest revenue slightly increased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets, including increases in securities available for sale and loans to banking clients, offset by lower yields on interest-earning assets. Net interest revenue in 2007 included incremental interest revenue generated from temporarily investing the proceeds from the sale of U.S. Trust. Consistent with declines in general market interest rates prevalent in 2008, the Company experienced declines in the yields of all interest-earning assets during 2008 as compared to 2007. Accordingly, the average interest rates on deposits from banking clients and payables to brokerage clients also decreased during 2008. The decline in the average interest rate on long-term debt was due to the additional debt issued at lower interest rates as part of the Company’s capital restructuring in 2007. Trading Revenue Trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenues are affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. Principal transaction revenues are primarily comprised of revenues from client fixed income securities trading activity. Factors that influence principal transaction revenues include the volume of client trades, market price volatility, and competitive pressures. Trading revenue decreased by $84 million, or 8%, in 2009 from 2008 due to lower daily average revenue trades and lower average revenue earned per revenue trade, as trading volume and market volatility eased from 2008 levels. Trading revenue increased by $220 million, or 26%, in 2008 from 2007 due to higher daily average revenue trades and higher average revenue earned per revenue trade. As shown in the following table, daily average revenue trades decreased 2% in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to lower volumes of principal transaction and mutual fund trades. Average revenue earned per revenue trade decreased 5% in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to lower average revenue earned per revenue trade for principal transactions and mutual funds, partially offset by higher average revenue earned per revenue trade for option securities. Daily average revenue trades increased 19% in 2008 from 2007 due to higher volumes of equity, mutual fund, option, and principal transaction trades. Average revenue earned per revenue trade increased 4% in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to higher average revenue earned per revenue trade for principal transactions, partially offset by lower average revenue earned per revenue trade for option securities.

Other Revenue Other revenue includes gains on the repurchases of long-term debt, realized gains and losses on sales of securities available for sale, gains and losses on sales of loans held for sale, service fees, and software maintenance fees. Other revenue increased by $81 million, or 86%, in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to the recognition of a gain on the repurchase of a portion of the Company’s long-term debt. The Company repurchased $98 million of trust preferred securities related to its Junior Subordinated Notes for a cash payment of $67 million in 2009. The repurchase of the trust preferred securities is considered - 21 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) an extinguishment of a portion of the Junior Subordinated Notes and resulted in a gain of $31 million. Other revenue decreased by $35 million, or 27%, in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to a realized loss of $29 million on the sale of a corporate debt security issued by Washington Mutual Bank as a result of its seizure by the FDIC in September 2008. This security was held in the Company’s available for sale portfolio. Net Impairment Losses on Securities The Company recorded net impairment charges of $60 million related to certain non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities in the Company’s available for sale portfolio in 2009 due to credit deterioration of the securities’ underlying collateral. In 2008, the Company recognized an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $44 million on a corporate debt security issued by Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (Lehman) as a result of Lehman’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition filing in September 2008. The Company sold this security in October 2008. This security was held in the Company’s available for sale portfolio. For further discussion, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 5. Securities Available for Sale and Securities Held to Maturity.” Expenses Excluding Interest As shown in the table below, expenses excluding interest decreased in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to decreases in compensation and benefits expense, professional services expense, and advertising and market development expense. Expenses excluding interest were relatively flat in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to a decrease in compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by increases in other expense and occupancy and equipment expense. Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate2008-2009 2009 2008 2007 Compensation and benefits (7 %) $ 1,544 $ 1,667 $ 1,781 Professional services (18 %) 275 334 324 Occupancy and equipment 6 % 318 299 282 Advertising and market development (21 %) 191 243 230 Communications (2 %) 206 211 200 Depreciation and amortization 5 % 159 152 156 Other 4 % 224 216 168 Total expenses excluding interest (7 %) $ 2,917 $ 3,122 $ 3,141 Expenses as a percentage of total net revenues: Total expenses excluding interest 70 % 61 % 63 % Advertising and market development 5 % 5 % 5 % Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits expense includes salaries and wages, incentive compensation, and related employee benefits and taxes. Incentive compensation is based on the achievement of specified performance objectives, including revenue growth and pre-tax profit margin, and therefore will fluctuate with these measures. - 22 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Compensation and benefits expense decreased by $123 million, or 7%, in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to decreases in salaries and wages expense and incentive compensation. Compensation and benefits expense decreased by $114 million, or 6%, in 2008 from 2007 due to decreases in incentive compensation and employee benefits and other expense, offset by an increase in salaries and wages expense. The following table shows a comparison of certain compensation and benefits components and employee data: Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate2008-2009 2009 2008 2007 Salaries and wages (9 %) $ 930 $ 1,020 $ 955 Incentive compensation (1) (12 %) 355 402 552 Employee benefits and other 6 % 259 245 274 Total compensation and benefits expense (7 %) $ 1,544 $ 1,667 $ 1,781 Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total net revenues: Salaries and wages 22 % 20 % 19 % Incentive compensation 8 % 8 % 11 % Employee benefits and other 7 % 4 % 6 % Total compensation and benefits expense 37 % 32 % 36 % Full-time equivalent employees (in thousands) (2) At year end (7 %) 12.4 13.4 13.3 Average (8 %) 12.4 13.5 12.9 (1) Includes variable compensation, discretionary bonus costs, stock-based compensation, and employee stock purchase plan expense. (2) Includes full-time, part-time and temporary employees, and persons employed on a contract basis, and excludes employees of outsourced service providers. Salaries and wages decreased in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to lower expense as a result of decreases in full-time employees and persons employed on a contract basis, offset by severance expense of $58 million relating to the Company’s cost reduction measures. Incentive compensation decreased in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to lower variable compensation based on actual performance in 2009. In addition, incentive compensation in 2008 included long-term incentive plan compensation. The last performance period under the Company’s long-term incentive program ended on December 31, 2008. Salaries and wages increased in 2008 from 2007 due to higher severance expense. Incentive compensation decreased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to lower long-term incentive plan compensation, discretionary bonus costs, and variable compensation. Discretionary bonus costs and variable compensation decreased in 2008 from 2007 based on actual performance in 2008. Long-term incentive plan compensation decreased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to the maturity of certain plan units that matured in 2007. Employee benefits and other expense decreased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to a decrease in deferred compensation. Expenses Excluding Compensation and Benefits Professional services expense decreased in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to a decrease in fees paid to outsourced service providers and consultants. Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to facilities charges of $43 million relating to the Company’s cost reduction measures, partially offset by lower purchases of equipment. Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to increases in data processing equipment and maintenance expense of $12 million and occupancy expense of $5 million. Advertising and market development expense decreased in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to lower media spending relating to the Company’s “Talk to Chuck™” national advertising campaign. Media spending and marketing expense decreased by $39 million and $13 million, respectively. Advertising and market development expense increased in 2008 from 2007 due to higher media spending related to the “Talk to Chuck™” national advertising campaign. - 23 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Other expense increased in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to a $16 million FDIC special industry assessment and higher FDIC insurance premiums caused by higher deposits from banking clients, partially offset by a decrease in employee travel expenses and insurance recovery of certain costs incurred in 2008. Other expense increased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to charges of $29 million for individual client complaints and arbitration claims relating to Schwab YieldPlus Fund® investments. Taxes on Income The Company’s effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations before taxes was 38.3% in 2009, 39.3% in 2008, and 39.6% in 2007. The decrease in the Company’s effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations from 2008 was primarily due to lower effective state income tax rates. Segment Information The Company provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments – Investor Services and Institutional Services. The Investor Services segment includes the Company’s retail brokerage and banking operations. The Institutional Services segment provides custodial, trading, and support services to independent investment advisors, as well as retirement plan services, plan administrator services, equity compensation plan services, and mutual fund clearing services. In addition, the Institutional Services segment supports the availability of Schwab proprietary mutual funds and collective trust funds on third-party platforms. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments on a pre-tax basis, excluding items such as impairment charges on non-financial assets, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and other significant restructuring charges. Segment assets and liabilities are not disclosed because the balances are not used for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments. Financial information for the Company’s reportable segments is presented in the following table: Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate2008-2009 2009 2008 2007 Investor Services: Net revenues (20 %) $ 2,710 $ 3,385 $ 3,352 Expenses excluding interest (10 %) 1,906 2,107 2,115 Contribution margin (37 %) $ 804 $ 1,278 $ 1,237 Institutional Services: Net revenues (15 %) $ 1,483 $ 1,754 $ 1,627 Expenses excluding interest (7 %) 929 1,001 1,006 Contribution margin (26 %) $ 554 $ 753 $ 621 Unallocated: Net revenues N/M $ — $ 11 $ 15 Expenses excluding interest N/M 82 14 20 Contribution margin N/M $ (82 ) $ (3 ) $ (5 ) Total: Net revenues (19 %) $ 4,193 $ 5,150 $ 4,994 Expenses excluding interest (7 %) 2,917 3,122 3,141 Contribution margin (37 %) $ 1,276 $ 2,028 $ 1,853 N/M Not meaningful. Investor Services Net revenues decreased by $675 million, or 20%, in 2009 from 2008 due to decreases in asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue, partially offset by an increase in other revenue. Asset management and administration fees decreased primarily due to lower average asset valuations and money market mutual fund fee waivers. Net interest revenue decreased as a result of the low interest rate environment, partially offset by higher average balances of interest-earning - 24 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) assets. The increase in other revenue was primarily due to the recognition of a gain on the repurchase of a portion of the Company’s long-term debt. In addition, other revenue in 2008 included a loss on the sale of a corporate debt security held in the Company’s available for sale portfolio. Net revenues were also negatively impacted by net impairment charges relating to certain residential mortgage-backed securities in the Company’s available for sale portfolio. Expenses excluding interest decreased by $201 million, or 10%, in 2009 from 2008, primarily due to lower compensation and benefits, professional services, and advertising and market development expenses. Net revenues increased by $33 million, or 1%, in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to increases in trading revenue and net interest revenue, partially offset by a decrease in other revenue. Trading revenue increased due to higher daily average revenue trades. Net interest revenue increased due to higher levels of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the impact of a decrease in the average net yield earned on these assets. The decrease in other revenue was primarily due to a loss on the sale of a corporate debt security. The increase in net revenues was also offset by an other-than-temporary impairment charge related to another corporate debt security. These securities were held in the Company’s available for sale portfolio. Expenses excluding interest were relatively flat in 2008 as compared to 2007 as a result of lower incentive compensation expense, offset by a charge for individual client complaints and arbitration claims related to Schwab YieldPlus Fund investments in 2008. Institutional Services Net revenues decreased by $271 million, or 15%, in 2009 from 2008 due to decreases in asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue, partially offset by an increase in other revenue. Asset management and administration fees decreased primarily due to lower average asset valuations and money market mutual fund fee waivers. Net interest revenue decreased as a result of the low interest rate environment, partially offset by higher average balances of interest-earning assets. Trading revenue decreased due to lower daily average revenue trades and lower average revenue earned per revenue trade. Net impairment losses on securities increased due to credit deterioration of certain mortgage-backed securities’ underlying collateral. The increase in other revenue was primarily due to the recognition of a gain on the repurchase of a portion of the Company’s long-term debt. Expenses excluding interest decreased by $72 million, or 7%, in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to lower compensation and benefits and professional services expenses, partially offset by an increase in other expense. Net revenues increased by $127 million, or 8%, in 2008 from 2007 due to increases in trading revenue and asset management and administration fees, offset by a decrease in net interest revenue. Trading revenue increased due to higher daily average revenue trades. Asset management and administration fees increased as a result of higher average balances of client assets invested in the Company’s proprietary funds. Net interest revenue decreased due to the impact of a decrease in the average net yield earned on interest-earning assets. Expenses excluding interest were relatively flat in 2008 as compared to 2007 as a result of lower incentive compensation expense, offset by increased costs to service additional corporate retirement plan participants resulting from the acquisition of the 401(k) Company in 2007. Unallocated Expenses excluding interest in 2009 include facilities and severance charges relating to the Company’s cost reduction measures. Discontinued Operations In July 2007, the Company sold all of the outstanding common stock of U.S. Trust for $3.3 billion in cash and recognized a gain on the sale of $1.9 billion, or $1.2 billion after tax. In connection with the determination of the final income tax gain on the sale of U.S. Trust, the Company recorded additional tax expense of $18 million in the second quarter of 2008. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CSC conducts substantially all of its business through its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The capital structure among CSC and its subsidiaries is designed to provide each entity with capital and liquidity to meet its operational needs and regulatory requirements. - 25 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) CSC is a savings and loan holding company and Schwab Bank, CSC’s depository institution, is a federal savings bank. CSC and Schwab Bank are both subject to supervision and regulation by the Office of Thrift Supervision. Liquidity CSC As a savings and loan holding company, CSC is not subject to specific statutory capital requirements. However, CSC is required to maintain capital that is sufficient to support the holding company and its subsidiaries’ business activities, and the risks inherent in those activities. To manage capital adequacy, CSC currently utilizes a target Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, of at least 6%. At December 31, 2009, CSC’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 7.1%. CSC’s liquidity needs are generally met through cash generated by its subsidiaries, as well as cash provided by external financing. CSC maintains excess liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments to cover daily funding needs and to support growth in the Company’s business. Generally, CSC does not hold liquidity at its subsidiaries in excess of amounts deemed sufficient to support the subsidiaries’ operations, including any regulatory capital requirements. Schwab and Schwab Bank are subject to regulatory requirements that may restrict them from certain transactions with CSC. Management believes that funds generated by the operations of CSC’s subsidiaries will continue to be the primary funding source in meeting CSC’s liquidity needs, providing adequate liquidity to meet Schwab Bank’s capital guidelines, and maintaining Schwab’s net capital. CSC has liquidity needs that arise from its Senior Medium-Term Notes, Series A (Medium-Term Notes), Junior Subordinated Notes, and Senior Notes, as well as from the funding of cash dividends, acquisitions, and other investments. The Medium-Term Notes, of which $450 million were outstanding at December 31, 2009, have maturities ranging from 2010 to 2017 and fixed interest rates ranging from 6.375% to 8.05% with interest payable semiannually. The Medium-Term Notes are rated A2 by Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), A by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group (Standard & Poor’s), and A by Fitch Ratings, Ltd. (Fitch). At December 31, 2009, $202 million of Junior Subordinated Notes were outstanding and have a fixed interest rate of 7.50% until 2017 and a floating rate thereafter. The Junior Subordinated Notes are not rated, however the trust preferred securities related to these notes are rated Baa1 by Moody’s, BBB+ by Standard & Poor’s, and BBB+ by Fitch. In 2009, CSC repurchased $98 million of trust preferred securities related to its Junior Subordinated Notes for a cash payment of $67 million. The repurchase of the trust preferred securities is considered an extinguishment of a portion of the Junior Subordinated Notes and resulted in a gain of $31 million. CSC has a universal automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC which enables CSC to issue debt, equity and other securities. In June 2009, the Company issued $750 million of Senior Notes that mature in 2014 under this registration statement. The Senior Notes have a fixed interest rate of 4.950% with interest payable semiannually. The Senior Notes are rated A2 by Moody’s, A by Standard & Poor’s, and A by Fitch. In January 2010, the Company completed an equity offering of 29,670,300 shares of its common stock under this registration statement. For further discussion of the equity offering, see “Subsequent Event.” CSC has authorization from its Board of Directors to issue unsecured commercial paper notes (Commercial Paper Notes) not to exceed $1.5 billion. Management has set a current limit for the commercial paper program of $800 million. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes may vary, but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper is not redeemable prior to maturity and cannot be voluntarily prepaid. The proceeds of the commercial paper program are to be used for general corporate purposes. There were no Commercial Paper Notes outstanding at December 31, 2009. CSC’s ratings for these short-term borrowings are P-1 by Moody’s, A-1 by Standard & Poor’s, and F1 by Fitch. CSC maintains an $800 million committed, unsecured credit facility with a group of 12 banks, which is scheduled to expire in June 2010. This facility replaced a similar facility that expired in June 2009. These facilities were unused in 2009. The funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes, including repayment of the Commercial Paper Notes discussed above. The amount of this facility that CSC can use for other general corporate purposes is reduced by the amount of any - 26 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Commercial Paper Notes outstanding. The financial covenants under this facility require Schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, as defined, Schwab Bank to be well capitalized, as defined, and CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity. At December 31, 2009, the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was $3.3 billion. Management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on CSC’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements. CSC also has direct access to $744 million of the $824 million uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines discussed below, that are primarily utilized by Schwab to manage short-term liquidity. These lines were not used by CSC in 2009. In addition, Schwab provides CSC with a $1.0 billion credit facility maturing in December 2011. No funds were drawn under this facility at December 31, 2009. Schwab Schwab is subject to regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit Schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings from CSC, paying cash dividends, or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees if such payment would result in net capital of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000. At December 31, 2009, Schwab’s net capital was $1.1 billion (11% of aggregate debit balances), which was $868 million in excess of its minimum required net capital and $580 million in excess of 5% of aggregate debit balances. Most of Schwab’s assets are readily convertible to cash, consisting primarily of short-term (i.e., less than 150 days) investment-grade, interest-earning investments (the majority of which are segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients pursuant to regulatory requirements), receivables from brokerage clients, and receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations. Client margin loans are demand loan obligations secured by readily marketable securities. Receivables from and payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations primarily represent current open transactions, which usually settle, or can be closed out, within a few business days. Liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts, which were $25.3 billion and $19.2 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for Schwab in the future. Schwab has a finance lease obligation related to an office building and land under a 20-year lease. The remaining finance lease obligation of $111 million at December 31, 2009, is being reduced by a portion of the lease payments over the remaining lease term of approximately 15 years. To manage short-term liquidity, Schwab maintains uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines with a group of seven banks totaling $824 million at December 31, 2009. The need for short-term borrowings arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest-bearing investments, and movements of cash to meet segregation requirements. Schwab used such borrowings for ten days in 2009, with daily amounts borrowed averaging $18 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2009. To satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), Schwab has unsecured standby letter of credit agreements (LOCs) with seven banks in favor of the OCC aggregating $445 million at December 31, 2009. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. Schwab satisfies the collateral requirements by arranging LOCs, in favor of these brokerage clients, which are issued by multiple banks. At December 31, 2009, the aggregate face amount of these LOCs totaled $37 million. There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs during 2009. - 27 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) To manage Schwab’s regulatory capital requirement, CSC provides Schwab with a $1.4 billion subordinated revolving credit facility which is scheduled to expire in March 2010. The amount outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2009, was $220 million. Borrowings under this subordinated lending arrangement qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab. In addition, CSC provides Schwab with a $1.5 billion credit facility which is scheduled to expire in 2011. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab. There were no funds drawn under this facility at December 31, 2009. Schwab Bank Schwab Bank is required to maintain a capital level that at least equals minimum capital levels specified in federal banking laws and regulations. Failure to meet the minimum levels will result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on Schwab Bank. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2009, Schwab Bank is considered well capitalized. Schwab Bank’s regulatory capital and ratios at December 31, 2009, are as follows: Actual Minimum CapitalRequirement Minimum to beWell Capitalized Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Tier 1 Capital $ 2,724 18.3 % $ 595 4.0 % $ 893 6.0 % Total Capital $ 2,770 18.6 % $ 1,191 8.0 % $ 1,488 10.0 % Tier 1 Leverage $ 2,724 6.3 % $ 1,737 4.0 % $ 2,171 5.0 % Tangible Equity $ 2,724 6.3 % $ 868 2.0 % N/A N/A Not applicable. In light of the evolving regulatory environment and capitalization trends observed across the banking industry, management has established a target Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for Schwab Bank of at least 7.5% beginning in the first quarter of 2010. Schwab Bank’s current liquidity needs are generally met through deposits from banking clients and equity capital. The excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts is swept into deposit accounts at Schwab Bank. At December 31, 2009, these balances totaled $23.0 billion. Schwab Bank has access to traditional funding sources such as deposits, federal funds purchased, and repurchase agreements. Additionally, Schwab Bank has access to short-term funding through the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) discount window. Amounts available under the FRB discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain of Schwab Bank’s securities available for sale and securities held to maturity that are pledged as collateral. At December 31, 2009, $974 million was available under this arrangement. There were no funds drawn under this arrangement during 2009. Schwab Bank maintains a credit facility with the Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLB). Amounts available under this facility are dependent on the amount of Schwab Bank’s residential real estate mortgages and home equity lines of credit that are pledged as collateral. At December 31, 2009, $2.9 billion was available under this facility. There were no funds drawn under this facility during 2009. CSC provides Schwab Bank with a $100 million short-term credit facility which is scheduled to expire in December 2011. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab Bank. There were no funds drawn under this facility during 2009. Capital Resources The Company monitors both the relative composition and absolute level of its capital structure. Management is focused on limiting the Company’s use of capital and currently targets a long-term debt to total financial capital ratio not to exceed 30%. - 28 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The Company’s total financial capital (long-term debt plus stockholders’ equity) at December 31, 2009, was $6.6 billion, up $1.6 billion, or 33%, from December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009, the Company had long-term debt of $1.5 billion, or 23% of total financial capital, that bears interest at a weighted-average rate of 5.97%. At December 31, 2008, the Company had long-term debt of $883 million, or 18% of total financial capital. In June 2009, the Company issued $750 million of Senior Notes that mature in 2014 and have a fixed interest rate of 4.950%. The Company repaid $13 million and $20 million of long-term debt in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, the Company repurchased $98 million of trust preferred securities related to its Junior Subordinated Notes for a cash payment of $67 million in 2009, resulting in a gain of $31 million. The Company’s cash position (reported as cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated balance sheet) and cash flows are affected by changes in brokerage client cash balances and the associated amounts required to be segregated under regulatory guidelines. Timing differences between cash and investments actually segregated on a given date and the amount required to be segregated for that date may arise in the ordinary course of business and are addressed by the Company in accordance with applicable regulations. Other factors which affect the Company’s cash position and cash flows include investment activity in securities, levels of capital expenditures, acquisition and divestiture activity, banking client deposit activity, brokerage and banking client loan activity, financing activity in long-term debt, payments of dividends, and repurchases of CSC’s common stock. The combination of these factors can cause significant fluctuations in the levels of cash and cash equivalents during specific time periods. Capital Expenditures The Company’s capital expenditures were $139 million in 2009 and $196 million in 2008. Capital expenditures as a percentage of net revenues were 3% and 4% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2009 were primarily for leasehold improvements, software and equipment relating to the Company’s information technology systems, and building improvements. Capital expenditures in 2008 were primarily for software and equipment relating to the Company’s information technology systems, buildings, and leasehold improvements. Capital expenditures include capitalized costs for developing internal-use software of $16 million in 2009 and $46 million in 2008. Management currently anticipates that 2010 capital expenditures will be approximately 5% lower than 2009 spending primarily due to decreased spending on leasehold improvements, partially offset by increased costs for developing internal-use software. As has been the case in recent years, the Company may adjust its capital expenditures from period to period as business conditions change. Management believes that funds generated by its operations will continue to be the primary funding source of its capital expenditures. Dividends CSC paid common stock cash dividends of $279 million and $253 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Since the initial dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 83 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend 19 times, including a 20% increase in the third quarter of 2008. Since 1989, dividends have increased by a 27% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. CSC paid common stock dividends of $.24, $.22, and $1.20 per share in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, the Company currently targets its cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income. Share Repurchases There were no repurchases of CSC’s common stock in 2009. CSC repurchased 17 million shares of its common stock for $350 million in 2008. As of December 31, 2009, CSC had remaining authority from the Board of Directors to repurchase up to $596 million of its common stock. - 29 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements The Company enters into various off-balance-sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of its clients. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, the Company enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For information on each of these arrangements, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 13. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.” Contractual Obligations A summary of the Company’s principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009, is shown in the following table. Excluded from this table are liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet that are generally short-term in nature (e.g., payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations) or without contractual payment terms (e.g., deposits from banking clients, payables to brokerage clients, and deferred compensation). Management believes that funds generated by its continuing operations, as well as cash provided by external financing, will continue to be the primary funding sources in meeting these obligations.

Includes purchase obligations which can be canceled by the Company without penalty. RISK MANAGEMENT Overview The Company’s business activities expose it to a variety of risks including technology, operations, credit, market, liquidity, legal, and reputational risk. Identification and management of these risks are essential to the success and financial soundness of the Company. Senior management takes an active role in the Company’s risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling various risks. Oversight of risk management has been delegated to the Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior managers of major business and control functions. The Global Risk Committee is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the Company’s risk exposures and leading the continued development of the Company’s risk management policies and practices. - 30 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report into the Global Risk Committee. These sub-committees include the: • Corporate Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee, which focuses on the Company’s liquidity, capital resources, interest rate risk, and investments; • Credit and Market Risk Oversight Committee, which focuses on the credit exposures resulting from client activity (e.g., margin lending activities and loans to banking clients), the investing activities of certain of the Company’s proprietary funds, corporate credit activities (e.g., counterparty and corporate investing activities), and market risk resulting from the Company taking positions in certain securities to facilitate client trading activity; • Information Security and Privacy Steering Committee, which oversees information security and privacy programs and policies; • Investment Management and ERISA Risk Committee, which oversees activities in which the Company and its principals operate in an investment advisory capacity or as an ERISA fiduciary; and • Investment Products Review Board, which provides senior level oversight of investment products and services made available to clients. The Global Risk Committee reports regularly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Audit Committee), which reviews major risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The Company’s Disclosure Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s (a) disclosure controls and procedures and (b) internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The Company’s compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and risk and credit management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring the Company’s risk management. Risk is inherent in the Company’s business. Consequently, despite the Company’s efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer unexpected losses due to operating or other risks. The following discussion highlights the Company’s policies and procedures for identification, assessment, and management of the principal areas of risk in its operations. Technology and Operating Risk Technology and operating risk is the potential for loss due to deficiencies in control processes or technology systems that constrain the Company’s ability to gather, process and communicate information and process client transactions efficiently and securely, without interruptions. The Company’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and the Company’s success depends, in part, on its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its technology in anticipation of evolving client needs. To the extent the Company experiences system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to its systems, linkages with third-party systems, and power failures), the Company’s business and operations could be significantly negatively impacted. Additionally, rapid increases in client demand may strain the Company’s ability to enhance its technology and expand its operating capacity. To minimize business interruptions, Schwab has two data centers intended, in part, to further improve the recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency. The Company is committed to an ongoing process of upgrading, enhancing, and testing its technology systems. This effort is focused on meeting client needs, meeting market and regulatory changes, and deploying standardized technology platforms. Technology and operating risk also includes the risk of human error, employee misconduct, external fraud, computer viruses, terrorist attack, and natural disaster. Employee misconduct could include fraud and misappropriation of client or Company assets, improper use or disclosure of confidential client or Company information, and unauthorized activities, such as transactions exceeding acceptable risks or authorized limits. External fraud includes misappropriation of client or Company assets by third parties, including through unauthorized access to Company systems and data and client accounts. The frequency and sophistication of such fraud attempts continue to increase. - 31 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The Company has specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and uses periodic risk self-assessments and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The Company maintains backup and recovery functions, including facilities for backup and communications, and conducts periodic testing of disaster recovery plans. The Company also maintains policies and procedures and technology to protect against fraud and unauthorized access to systems and data. Despite the Company’s risk management efforts, it is not always possible to deter or prevent technological or operational failure, or fraud or other misconduct, and the precautions taken by the Company may not be effective in all cases. The Company may be subject to litigation, losses, and regulatory actions in such cases, and may be required to expend significant additional resources to remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures. The Company also faces technology and operating risk when it employs the services of various external vendors, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, and support functions. The Company manages its exposure to external vendor risk through contractual provisions, control standards, and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance. The Company maintains policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with Company data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-public client information. The Company clearly defines for employees, contractors, and vendors the Company’s expected standards of care for confidential data. Regular training is provided by the Company in regard to data security. The Company is actively engaged in the research and development of new technologies, services, and products. The Company endeavors to protect its research and development efforts, and its brands, through the use of copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and contracts. Credit Risk Credit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations. The Company’s direct exposure to credit risk mainly results from margin lending activities, securities lending activities, mortgage lending activities, its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities, and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds that the Company sponsors. To manage the risks of such losses, the Company has established policies and procedures which include: establishing and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin requirements for certain securities. Most of the Company’s credit extensions are supported by collateral arrangements. Collateral arrangements relating to margin loans, securities lending agreements, and resale agreements are subject to requirements that provide additional collateral in the event that market fluctuations result in declines in the value of collateral received. The Company’s credit risk exposure related to loans to banking clients is actively managed through individual and portfolio reviews performed by management. Management regularly reviews asset quality including concentrations, delinquencies, non-performing loans, losses, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses, which is reviewed quarterly by senior management. The Company’s mortgage loan portfolios primarily include first lien 3-, 5- and 7-year adjustable rate residential mortgage loans (First Mortgage portfolio) of $3.7 billion and home equity lines of credit (HELOC portfolio) of $3.3 billion at December 31, 2009. The Company’s First Mortgage portfolio underwriting requirements are generally consistent with the underwriting requirements in the secondary market for loan portfolios. The Company’s guidelines include maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Issac & Company (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan is conforming or jumbo). These credit underwriting standards have limited the exposure to the types of loans that experienced high foreclosures and loss rates elsewhere in the industry during 2009 and 2008. There have been no - 32 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) significant changes to the LTV ratio or FICO credit score guidelines related to the Company’s First Mortgage or HELOC portfolios during 2009. At December 31, 2009, the weighted-average originated LTV ratios were 62% and 59% for the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, respectively, and the weighted-average originated FICO credit scores were 760 and 767 for the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, respectively. The Company does not offer loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO credit score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. At December 31, 2009, approximately 2% of both the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios consisted of loans to borrowers with FICO credit scores of less than 620. The following table presents certain of the Company’s loan quality metrics as a percentage of total outstanding loans: December 31, 2009 2008 Loan delinquencies (1) 0.87 % 0.54 % Nonaccrual loans 0.46 % 0.13 % Allowance for credit losses 0.61 % 0.33 % (1) Loan delinquencies are defined as loans that are 30 days or more past due. The Company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale and securities held to maturity portfolios, whose fair values totaled $22.1 billion and $6.9 billion at December 31, 2009, respectively. These portfolios include U.S. agency and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, U.S. agency notes, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, and asset-backed securities. U.S. agency residential mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings, however management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. agencies. Included in non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities are securities collateralized by loans that are considered to be “Prime” (defined by the Company as loans to borrowers with a FICO credit score of 620 or higher at origination), and “Alt-A” (defined by the Company as Prime loans with reduced documentation at origination). The table below presents the credit ratings for U.S. agency and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities available for sale and securities held to maturity, including Prime and Alt-A residential mortgage-backed securities, by year of origination. In some instances securities have divergent ratings from Moody’s, Fitch, or Standard & Poor’s. In these instances, the Company has used the lowest rating as of December 31, 2009, for purposes of presenting the table below. Residential mortgage-backed securities, particularly Alt-A securities, experienced deteriorating credit characteristics, including increased delinquencies and valuation pressure, in 2009. For a discussion of the impact of current market conditions on residential mortgage-backed securities, see “Current Market Environment.” - 33 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) AAA AA to A BBB BB or Lower Total AmortizedCost NetUnrealizedGain (Loss) AmortizedCost NetUnrealizedLoss AmortizedCost NetUnrealizedLoss AmortizedCost NetUnrealizedLoss AmortizedCost NetUnrealizedGain (Loss) U.S. agency residential mortgage-backed securities: 2005 $ 584 $ 6 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 584 $ 6 2006 390 1 — — — — — — 390 1 2007 709 25 — — — — — — 709 25 2008 4,360 129 — — — — — — 4,360 129 2009 10,663 26 — — — — — — 10,663 26 Total 16,706 187 — — — — — — 16,706 187 Non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities: 2003 80 (7 ) 8 (1 ) — — — — 88 (8 ) 2004 134 (9 ) 84 (13 ) 9 (5 ) — — 227 (27 ) 2005 64 (6 ) 303 (37 ) 236 (50 ) 366 (91 ) 969 (184 ) 2006 13 — 37 (5 ) — — 644 (201 ) 694 (206 ) 2007 93 (4 ) — — 34 (5 ) 355 (85 ) 482 (94 ) Total 384 (26 ) 432 (56 ) 279 (60 ) 1,365 (377 ) 2,460 (519 ) Total residential mortgage-backed securities $ 17,090 $ 161 $ 432 $ (56 ) $ 279 $ (60 ) $ 1,365 $ (377 ) $ 19,166 $ (332 ) % of Total residential mortgage-backed securities 89 % 2 % 2 % 7 % 100 % At December 31, 2009, all of the corporate debt securities and non-mortgage asset-backed securities were rated investment grade (defined as a rating equivalent to a Moody’s rating of “Baa” or higher, or a Standard & Poor’s rating of “BBB-” or higher). Schwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab’s client or a counterparty fails to meet its obligations to Schwab. Concentration Risk The Company has exposure to concentration risk when holding large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry. The fair value of the Company’s investments in residential mortgage-backed securities totaled $18.8 billion at December 31, 2009. Of these, $16.9 billion were U.S. agency securities and $1.9 billion were non-agency securities. The U.S. agency securities are included in securities available for sale and securities held to maturity and the non-agency securities are included in securities available for sale. Included in non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities are securities collateralized by Alt-A loans. At December 31, 2009, the amortized cost and fair value of Alt-A mortgage-backed securities were $628 million and $387 million, respectively. The Company’s investments in corporate debt securities and commercial paper totaled $5.6 billion at December 31, 2009, with the majority issued by institutions in the financial services industry. These securities are included in securities available for sale, securities held to maturity, cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes, cash and cash equivalents, and other securities owned in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Included in corporate debt securities and commercial paper at December 31, 2009, were $3.2 billion of securities issued by financial institutions and guaranteed under the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. The Company’s loans to banking clients include $3.7 billion of first lien residential real estate mortgage loans at December 31, 2009. Approximately 75% of these mortgages consisted of loans with interest-only payment terms. The interest - 34 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) rates on approximately 75% of these interest-only loans are not scheduled to reset for three or more years. The Company’s interest-only loans do not include interest terms described as temporary introductory rates below current market rates. At December 31, 2009, 39% of the residential real estate mortgages and 48% of the home equity lines of credit balances were secured by properties which are located in California. The Company also has exposure to concentration risk from its margin and securities lending activities collateralized by securities of a single issuer or industry. The Company has indirect exposure to U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral to secure its resale agreements. The Company’s primary credit exposure on these resale transactions is with its counterparty. The Company would have exposure to the U.S. Government and agency securities only in the event of the counterparty’s default on the resale agreements. U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral for resale agreements totaled $8.5 billion at December 31, 2009. Market Risk Market risk is the potential for changes in revenue or the value of financial instruments held by the Company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices or market conditions. For discussion of the Company’s market risk, see “Item 7A – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” Fiduciary Risk Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. The Company attempts to manage this risk by establishing procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees. Legal and Regulatory Risk The Company faces significant legal and compliance risk in its business, and the volume of litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services firms and the amount of damages claimed have been increasing. Among other things, these risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for Company products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of the Company’s controls. Claims against the Company may increase due to a variety of factors, such as if clients suffer losses during a period of deteriorating equity market conditions, as the Company increases the level of advice it provides to clients, and as the Company enhances the services it provides to IAs. In addition, the Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, and SROs, and such regulation is becoming increasingly extensive and complex. The Company attempts to manage legal and compliance risk through policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid litigation claims and prevent or detect violations of applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, client privacy, employment policies, and contracts management. Despite the Company’s efforts to maintain an effective compliance program and internal controls, legal breaches and rule violations could result in reputational harm, significant losses and disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on the Company’s business activities. - 35 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company uses fair value measurements to record certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value, and to determine fair value disclosures. At December 31, 2009, $30.1 billion, or 40% of total assets, were recorded at fair value. At December 31, 2008, $21.9 billion, or 42% of total assets, were recorded at fair value. All of these assets were measured at fair value using quoted prices or market-based information and accordingly were classified as Level 1 or Level 2 measurements in accordance with the fair value hierarchy described in fair value measurement accounting guidance. Liabilities recorded at fair value were not material at December 31, 2009 or 2008. See note “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 15. Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities” for more information on the Company’s assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value. The Company uses prices obtained from an independent third-party pricing service to measure the fair value of certain investment securities. The Company validates prices received from the pricing service using various methods including, comparison to prices received from additional pricing services, comparison to available quoted market prices, internal valuation models, and review of other relevant market data. The Company does not adjust the prices received from the independent third-party pricing service unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in a material difference in the recorded amounts. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company did not adjust prices received from the independent third-party pricing service. For certificates of deposits and treasury securities included in investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes, the Company uses discounted cash-flow models to measure the fair value that utilize market-based inputs including observable market interest rates that correspond to the remaining maturities or next interest reset dates. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. While the majority of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position and reported financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy. Other-than-Temporary Impairment of Securities Available for Sale and Securities Held to Maturity: Management evaluates whether securities available for sale and securities held to maturity are other-than-temporarily impaired (OTTI) on a quarterly basis. Debt securities with unrealized losses are considered OTTI if the Company intends to sell the security or if the Company will be required to sell such security prior to any anticipated recovery. If management determines that a security is OTTI under these circumstances, the impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the entire difference between the amortized cost and then-current fair value. A security is also OTTI if management does not expect to recover the amortized cost of the security. In this circumstance, management utilizes cash flow models to estimate the expected future cash flow from the securities and to estimate the credit loss. The impairment recognized in earnings is measured by the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost of the security. Expected cash flows are discounted using the security’s effective interest rate. The evaluation of whether the Company expects to recover the amortized cost of a security is inherently judgmental. The evaluation includes the assessment of several bond performance indicators including: the portion of the underlying loans that are delinquent (30 days, 60 days, 90+ days), in bankruptcy, in foreclosure or converted to real estate owned; the actual amount of loss incurred on the underlying loans in which the property has been foreclosed and sold; the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security available to absorb credit losses on the underlying loans; the current credit ratings issued by either Standard & Poor’s, Fitch Ratings, or Moody’s; the current price and magnitude of the unrealized loss; and whether the Company has received all scheduled principal and interest payments. Management uses cash flow models to further assess the likelihood of other-than-temporary impairment for the Company’s non-agency residential mortgage-backed - 36 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) securities. To develop the cash flow models, the Company uses forecasted loss severity, prepayment speeds (i.e. the rate at which the principal on underlying loans are paid down), and default rates over the securities’ remaining maturities. Forecasted home price fluctuations are an important variable in forecasting the expected loss severity and default rates. Based on these cash flow projections, management determines if the Company expects to recover all of the amortized cost of the securities and therefore if the securities are OTTI. Valuation of Goodwill: The Company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually, or whenever indications of impairment exist. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, resulting in an impairment charge for this excess. The Company has elected April 1st as its annual goodwill impairment testing date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on April 1, 2009, management estimated the fair value of each of the Company’s reporting units (generally defined as the Company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) and compared this value to the carrying value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value, and therefore management concluded that no amount of goodwill was impaired. The estimated fair value of the reporting units was established using a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit. Adverse changes in the Company’s planned business operations such as unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit, or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the Company’s recorded goodwill. Allowance for Credit Losses: The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed regularly by management, taking into consideration current economic conditions, the existing loan portfolio composition, past loss experience, and risks inherent in the portfolio, as more fully described below. The Company performs a quarterly analysis to estimate the allowance for credit losses. This process utilizes loan-level statistical models that estimate prepayments, defaults, and expected life of loan losses for our loan portfolios based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the portfolios. The models consider effects of borrower behavior and a variety of factors including, but not limited to, interest rate fluctuations, housing price movements, current economic conditions, estimated defaults and foreclosures, delinquencies, the loan portfolio composition (including concentrations of credit risk), past loss experience, estimates of loss severity, and credit scores. The more significant variables within the models include a measure of delinquency roll rates, the amount of loss in the event of default, housing prices, and interest rates. Delinquency roll rates (i.e., the rates at which loans transition through delinquency stages and ultimately result in a loss) are estimated from the Company’s historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information. Loss in the event of default is based on the Company’s historical loss experience and market trends. Housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and statistical forecasts of future home values. Factors affecting the home price index include: housing inventory, unemployment, interest rates, and inflation expectations. Interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths. This quarterly analysis results in a loss factor that is applied to the outstanding balances to determine the allowance for credit loss for each loan category. Legal Reserve: Reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, insurance coverage and indemnification, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved. The Company’s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee. Additionally, management has reviewed with the Audit Committee the Company’s significant estimates discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. - 37 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS In addition to historical information, this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential for changes in revenue or the value of financial instruments held by the Company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices or market conditions. For the Company’s market risk related to interest rates, a sensitivity analysis, referred to as a net interest revenue simulation model, is shown below. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources that finance these assets. Net interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may re-price at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short and long-term interest rates. Interest-earning assets include residential real estate loans and residential mortgage-backed securities. These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and to changes to prepayment levels, which tend to increase in a declining rate environment. To mitigate the risk of loss, the Company has established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk, and monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interest-earning assets and funding sources. To remain within these guidelines, the Company manages the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios. Because the Company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients, the rates charged on margin loans, and controls the composition of its investment securities, it has some ability to manage its net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions. The Company is also subject to market risk as a result of fluctuations in equity prices. The Company’s direct holdings of equity securities and its associated exposure to equity prices are not material. The Company is indirectly exposed to equity market fluctuations in connection with securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers, and customer securities loaned out as part of the Company’s securities lending activities. Equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity, margin borrowing, and overall client engagement with the Company. Additionally, the Company earns mutual fund service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets. Fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue earned by the Company. Financial instruments held by the Company are also subject to liquidity risk – that is, the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument. Recent conditions in the credit markets have significantly reduced market liquidity in a wide range of financial instruments, including the types of instruments held by the Company, and fair value can differ significantly from the value implied by the credit quality and actual performance of the instrument’s underlying cash flows. Financial instruments held by the Company are also subject to valuation risk as a result of changes in valuations of the underlying collateral, such as housing prices in the case of residential real estate loans and mortgage-backed securities. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and securities available for sale, see “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Current Market Environment”. The Company’s market risk related to financial instruments held for trading, interest rate swaps related to a portion of its fixed interest rate Medium-Term Notes, and forward sale and interest rate lock commitments related to its loans held for sale portfolio is not material. Net Interest Revenue Simulation The Company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulation model (the model) includes all interest-sensitive assets and liabilities, as well as interest rate swap agreements utilized by the Company to hedge its interest rate risk. Key variables in the model include the repricing of - 39 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION financial instruments, prepayment and reinvestment assumptions, and product pricing assumptions. The Company uses constant balances and market rates in the model assumptions in order to minimize the number of variables and to better isolate risks. The simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies, including changes in asset and liability mix. As represented by the simulations presented below, the Company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall (i.e., interest-earning assets generally reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities). The simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As the Company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood the Company would take steps to manage any additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment. The following table shows the results of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to the Company’s current market rates forecast on simulated net interest revenue over the next 12 months at December 31, 2009 and 2008. While the Company typically uses a gradual 200 basis point change, it revised the methodology at March 31, 2008 due to the current low levels of interest rates. The Company will use a gradual 100 basis point change until such time as the level of interest rates justifies a return to the previous methodology. December 31, 2009 2008 Increase of 100 basis points 16.8 % 6.4 % Decrease of 100 basis points (2.9 %) (6.8 %) The sensitivities shown in the simulation reflect the fact that short-term interest rates in 2009 continued to decline even though the Fed Funds target rate remained at a range of zero to 0.25%. During 2009, the Company’s yield on interest-earning assets fell faster than its already low cost of funding sources. Since current short-term interest rates are so low, further declines have a lesser impact on net interest revenue, while increases in short-term interest rates result in a greater impact as yields on interest-earning assets rise faster than the cost of funding sources. - 40 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION",2023-12-30 18:56:18.227593

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Management of the Company focuses on several key financial and non-financial metrics in evaluating the Company’s financial position and operating performance. All information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is presented on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted. Summarized results for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 are shown in the following table: Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate1-Year2009-2010 2010 2009 2008 Client Activity Metrics: Net new client assets (1) (in billions) (70 %) $ 26.6 $ 87.3 $ 113.4 Client assets (in billions, at year end) 11 % $ 1,574.5 $ 1,422.6 $ 1,137.0 Clients’ daily average trades (2) (in thousands) (4 %) 399.7 414.8 432.1 Company Financial Metrics: Net revenues 1 % $ 4,248 $ 4,193 $ 5,150 Expenses excluding interest 19 % 3,469 2,917 3,122 Income from continuing operations before taxes on income (39 %) 779 1,276 2,028 Taxes on income (34 %) (325 ) (489 ) (798 ) Income from continuing operations (42 %) 454 787 1,230 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax — — — (18 ) Net income (42 %) $ 454 $ 787 $ 1,212 Earnings per share from continuing operations – diluted (44 %) $ .38 $ .68 $ 1.06 Earnings per share – diluted (44 %) $ .38 $ .68 $ 1.05 Net revenue growth (decline) from prior year 1 % (19 %) 3 % Pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations 18.3 % 30.4 % 39.4 % Return on stockholders’ equity 8 % 17 % 31 % Net revenue per average full-time equivalent employee (in thousands) — $ 337 $ 338 $ 383 (1) Includes net outflows of $51.5 billion in 2010 related to the planned deconversion of a mutual fund clearing services client. (2) Beginning in 2010, amounts include all commission-free trades, including the Company’s Mutual Fund OneSource® funds and ETFs, and other proprietary products. Prior period amounts have been recast to reflect this change. • Net new client assets is defined as the total inflows of client cash and securities to the firm less client outflows. Management believes that this metric depicts how well the Company’s products and services appeal to new and existing clients in a given operating environment. • Client assets is the market value of all client assets housed at the Company. Management considers client assets to be indicative of the Company’s appeal in the marketplace. Additionally, fluctuations in certain components of client assets (e.g., Mutual Fund OneSource funds) directly impact asset management and administration fees. • Clients’ daily average trades is an indicator of client engagement with securities markets and the most prominent driver of trading revenue. • Management believes that earnings per share, net revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations, and return on stockholders’ equity provide broad indicators of the Company’s overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns within the context of a given operating environment. • Net revenue per average full-time equivalent employee is considered by management to be the Company’s broadest measure of productivity. - 16 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The Company’s major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue. The Company generates asset management and administration fees through its proprietary and third-party mutual fund offerings, as well as fee-based investment management and advisory services. Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue are impacted by securities valuations, interest rates, the Company’s ability to attract new clients, and client activity levels. The Company generates trading revenue through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenue from trading activity in fixed income securities. Trading revenue is impacted by trading volumes, the volatility of prices in the equity and fixed income markets, and commission rates. 2010 Compared to 2009 The equity markets improved during 2010 and remained well above their prior year lows. The Nasdaq Composite Index, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 17%, 13%, and 11%, respectively. The three-month LIBOR increased by 5 basis points to .30% in 2010, however the low interest rate environment continued throughout the year as the federal funds target rate remained unchanged during the year at a range of zero to 0.25%. The Company’s sustained investment in expanding and improving product and service capabilities for its clients was reflected in the strength of its key client activity metrics in 2010 – net new client assets totaled $78.1 billion, excluding outflows related to a single Mutual Fund Clearing client who completed a planned transfer to an internal platform during the year, and total client assets ended 2010 at a record $1.57 trillion, up 11% from 2009. Client trading activity slowed during the year as clients’ daily average trades decreased 4% from 2009 to 399,700. Net revenues were relatively flat in 2010 from 2009. However, the Company experienced a change in the mix of its revenue sources as the increase in net interest revenue was offset by decreases in trading revenue, asset management and administration fees, and other revenue. Net interest revenue increased due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in the average yield earned. Trading revenue decreased due to lower average revenue per revenue trade resulting from improved online trade pricing for clients, which was implemented in January 2010, and slightly lower daily average revenue trades in 2010. While the low interest rate environment caused over $200 million of additional money market mutual fund fee waivers from the prior year, the decrease in asset management and administration fees was limited to 3% due to higher average asset valuations and continued asset inflows. Other revenue was lower in comparison to 2009 due to a gain of $31 million on the repurchase of a portion of the Company’s long-term debt in 2009. Expenses excluding interest increased by 19% in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to the recognition of certain significant charges in 2010. The Company recognized class action litigation and regulatory reserves and other costs totaling $320 million relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund®. Additionally, the Company decided to cover the net remaining losses recognized by Schwab money market mutual funds as a result of their investments in a single structured investment vehicle that defaulted in 2008 and recorded a charge of $132 million in 2010. Also, as a result of challenging credit card industry economics, the Company ended its sponsorship in its Invest First® and WorldPoints(a) Visa(b) credit cards and recorded a charge of $30 million. The Company’s ongoing expense discipline helped limit the growth in all other expense categories in the aggregate to 3% over the prior year. 2009 Compared to 2008 Economic and market conditions were challenging throughout 2009, marked by unprecedented market dynamics including declines in short-term interest rates and home valuations, increases in home foreclosures and delinquencies, and tight credit markets. While the federal funds target rate was unchanged at a range of zero to 0.25%, the three-month LIBOR decreased by 158 basis points to 0.25%. At the same time, although the equity markets showed sustained improvement from their March (a) WorldPoints is a registered trademark of FIA Card Services, N.A.

The Company attracted $87.3 billion in net new client assets during 2009 and total client assets were $1.42 trillion at December 31, 2009, up 25% from the prior year, reflecting the Company’s success in attracting and retaining clients. Client trading activity slowed modestly during 2009 as clients’ daily average trades decreased 4% to 414,800 from 2008. Net revenues decreased by 19% in 2009 from 2008, primarily due to the decreases in asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue. Asset management and administration fees decreased in 2009 primarily due to money market mutual fund fee waivers of $224 million and lower average equity market valuations. There were no money market mutual fund fee waivers in 2008. Net interest revenue decreased as a result of the low interest rate environment, partially offset by higher average balances of interest-earning assets. These decreases were offset by the increase in other revenue. Other revenue in 2009 included a $31 million gain on the repurchase of a portion of the Company’s long-term debt. In addition, other revenue in 2008 included a loss of $29 million on the sale of a corporate debt security held in the Company’s available for sale portfolio. Net revenues were also negatively impacted by net impairment charges of $60 million in 2009 relating to certain residential mortgage-backed securities in the Company’s available for sale portfolio. Net impairment losses on securities in 2008 included an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $44 million related to a corporate debt security held in the Company’s available for sale portfolio. Expenses excluding interest decreased by 7% in 2009 from 2008, primarily due to the decreases in compensation and benefits, professional services, and advertising and market development expenses. The decrease in expenses was partially offset by severance and facilities charges of $101 million relating to the Company’s cost reduction measures and a $16 million FDIC special industry assessment. As a result of the Company’s cost reduction measures and expense discipline, the Company achieved a pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations of 30.4% and return on stockholders’ equity of 17% in 2009. Net revenue per average full-time equivalent employee was $338,000 in 2009, down 12% from 2008 due to lower net revenues, partially offset by the decrease in average full-time equivalent employees. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. All references to EPS information in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reflect diluted EPS unless otherwise noted. Business Acquisition On November 9, 2010, the Company completed its acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Windward for $106 million in common stock and $44 million in cash. Windward was an investment advisory firm that managed diversified investment portfolios comprised primarily of ETFs. CURRENT MARKET AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT While the equity markets improved from their March 2009 lows, which helped to strengthen the Company’s net revenues in 2010, the interest rate environment remains challenging and may continue to constrain the Company’s net revenues. Short-term interest rates remained at historically low levels in 2010, as the federal funds target rate was unchanged at a range of zero to 0.25%, and the three-month and six-month LIBOR were below year-earlier levels for the majority of the year. To the extent rates remain at these low levels, the Company’s net interest revenue will continue to be constrained. The low rate environment also affects asset management and administration fees. The overall yields on certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds have fallen to levels at or below the management fees the Company earns on those funds. The Company continues to waive a portion of its management fees, which it began to do in the first quarter of 2009, so that the funds may continue providing a positive return to clients. These and other money market mutual funds may continue to find it necessary - 18 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) to replace maturing securities with low yielding securities and the overall yield on such funds may remain below the management fees on those funds. To the extent this occurs, fees may continue to be waived and could increase from the fourth quarter 2010 level, which would negatively affect asset management and administration fees. The Company recorded net impairment charges of $36 million and $60 million related to certain non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities in 2010 and 2009, respectively, due to credit deterioration of the securities’ underlying collateral. Further deterioration in the performance of the underlying loans in the Company’s residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges. The “Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act” was signed into law in July 2010. Among other things, the legislation authorizes various assessments and fees and requires the establishment of minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for insured depository institutions. CSC is continuing to review the impact the legislation, studies and related rule-making will have on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion presents an analysis of the Company’s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008. Net Revenues The Company’s major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue. Asset management and administration fees and trading revenue decreased, while net interest revenue increased in 2010 as compared to 2009. Asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue decreased in 2009 as compared to 2008.

The Company earns mutual fund service fees for shareholder services, administration, investment management, and transfer agent services (through July 2009) provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. These fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in the Company’s proprietary funds and third-party funds. The Company also earns asset management fees for advisory and managed account services, which are based on the daily balances of client assets subject to the specific fee for service. The fair values of client assets included in proprietary and third-party mutual funds are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data. Asset management and administration fees may vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees, see “Current Market and Regulatory Environment.” Asset management and administration fees decreased by $53 million, or 3%, in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to the decrease in mutual fund service fees, partially offset by an increase in investment management and trust fees. Asset management and administration fees decreased by $480 million, or 20%, in 2009 from 2008 due to decreases in mutual fund service fees and investment management and trust fees. Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate2009-2010 2010 2009 2008 Asset management and administration fees before money market mutual fund fee waivers 7 % $ 2,255 $ 2,099 $ 2,355 Money market mutual fund fee waivers 93 % (433 ) (224 ) — Asset management and administration fees (3 %) $ 1,822 $ 1,875 $ 2,355 Mutual fund service fees decreased by $169 million, or 11%, in 2010 from 2009 and by $414 million, or 22%, in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to money market mutual fund fee waivers. Given the low interest rate environment in 2010 and 2009, the overall yields on certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds have fallen to levels at or below the management fees on those funds. As a result, the Company waived a portion of its fees in 2010 and 2009, in order to provide a positive return to clients. There were no money market mutual fund fee waivers in 2008. The decrease in mutual fund service fees in 2010 was partially offset by the effect of higher average balances of client assets invested in the Company’s Mutual Fund OneSource funds as a result of higher average asset valuations and continued asset inflows. The decrease in mutual fund service fees in 2009 was also due to lower average balances of client assets invested in the Company’s Mutual Fund OneSource funds and mutual fund clearing services as a result of lower average equity market valuations. Investment management and trust fees increased by $104 million, or 38%, in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to higher average balances of client assets participating in advisory and managed account services programs. This increase was partially offset by temporary fees rebates of $63 million offered to qualifying clients that participated in those programs. Investment management and trust fees decreased by $67 million, or 20%, in 2009 from 2008 due to temporary fee rebates relating to the same programs discussed previously. Net Interest Revenue Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies. The Company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall (i.e., interest-earning assets generally reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities). When interest rates fall, the Company may attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending the maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lock-in asset yields as well as by lowering rates paid to clients on interest-bearing liabilities. Since the Company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients, as well as the rates charged on receivables from brokerage clients, and also controls the composition of its investment securities, it has - 20 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) some ability to manage its net interest spread. However, the spread is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on net interest revenue, see “Current Market and Regulatory Environment.” In clearing its clients’ trades, Schwab holds cash balances payable to clients. In most cases, Schwab pays its clients interest on cash balances awaiting investment, and may invest these funds and earn interest revenue. Receivables from brokerage clients consist primarily of margin loans to brokerage clients. Margin loans are loans made by Schwab to clients on a secured basis to purchase securities. Pursuant to SEC regulations, client cash balances that are not used for margin lending are generally segregated into investment accounts that are maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients, which are recorded in cash and investments segregated on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. When investing segregated client cash balances, Schwab must adhere to SEC regulations that restrict investments to securities guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, participation certificates, mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association, certificates of deposit issued by U.S. banks and thrifts, and resale agreements collateralized by qualified securities. Additionally, Schwab has established policies for the minimum credit quality and maximum maturity of these investments. Schwab Bank also maintains investment portfolios for liquidity as well as to invest funding from deposits raised in excess of loans to banking clients. Schwab Bank’s securities available for sale include residential mortgage-backed securities, U.S. agency notes, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, and certificates of deposit. Schwab Bank’s securities held to maturity include residential mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, and corporate debt securities. Schwab Bank lends funds to banking clients primarily in the form of mortgage loans and HELOCs. These loans are largely funded by interest-bearing deposits from banking clients. The Company’s interest-earning assets are financed primarily by brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients. Noninterest-bearing funding sources include noninterest-bearing brokerage client cash balances and proceeds from stock-lending activities, as well as stockholders’ equity. - 21 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The following table presents net interest revenue information corresponding to interest-earning assets and funding sources on the consolidated balance sheet: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense AverageYield/Rate AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense AverageYield/Rate AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense AverageYield/Rate Interest-earning assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 7,269 $ 19 0.26 % $ 7,848 $ 33 0.42 % $ 5,217 $ 129 2.47 % Cash and investments segregated 19,543 57 0.29 % 16,291 80 0.49 % 11,223 280 2.49 % Broker-related receivables (1) 317 — 0.08 % 363 1 0.28 % 428 8 1.87 % Receivables from brokerage clients 8,981 437 4.87 % 6,749 351 5.20 % 10,278 612 5.95 % Other securities owned (2) 74 — 0.45 % 126 1 0.79 % — — — Securities available for sale (3) 24,209 486 2.01 % 18,558 521 2.81 % 11,772 517 4.39 % Securities held to maturity 10,440 361 3.46 % 1,915 74 3.86 % 22 1 5.86 % Loans to banking clients 7,987 275 3.44 % 6,671 241 3.61 % 4,831 227 4.70 % Loans held for sale 80 4 5.00 % 110 5 4.55 % 66 4 6.06 % Total interest-earning assets 78,900 1,639 2.08 % 58,631 1,307 2.23 % 43,837 1,778 4.06 % Other interest revenue 84 121 130 Total interest-earning assets $ 78,900 $ 1,723 2.18 % $ 58,631 $ 1,428 2.44 % $ 43,837 $ 1,908 4.35 % Funding sources: Deposits from banking clients $ 44,858 $ 105 0.23 % $ 31,249 $ 107 0.34 % $ 19,203 $ 104 0.54 % Payables to brokerage clients 22,715 2 0.01 % 18,002 3 0.02 % 15,220 55 0.36 % Short-term borrowings — — — — — — 40 1 2.54 % Long-term debt 1,648 92 5.58 % 1,231 71 5.77 % 890 59 6.63 % Total interest-bearing liabilities 69,221 199 0.29 % 50,482 181 0.36 % 35,353 219 0.62 % Noninterest-bearing funding sources 9,679 8,149 8,484 Other interest expense — 2 7 Total funding sources $ 78,900 $ 199 0.25 % $ 58,631 $ 183 0.32 % $ 43,837 $ 226 0.51 % Net interest revenue $ 1,524 1.93 % $ 1,245 2.12 % $ 1,682 3.84 % (1) Includes receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations. Interest revenue on broker-related receivables was less than $500,000 in 2010. (2) Interest revenue on other securities owned was less than $500,000 in 2010. (3) Amounts have been calculated based on amortized cost. Net interest revenue increased in 2010 from 2009 due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets. This resulted from significant growth in the average balance of deposits from banking clients, which in turn funded increases in the average balances of securities held to maturity, securities available for sale, and loans to banking clients. These interest-earning assets are invested at rates above the cost of supporting funding sources. The increase in net interest revenue was partially offset by the low interest rate environment that persisted in 2010, which resulted in the decline in the yields of almost all interest-earning assets compared to 2009. Net interest revenue decreased in 2009 from 2008 due to the low interest rate environment in 2009. As a result, the Company experienced declines in the yields and rates of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities compared to 2008, with yields on interest-earning assets declining more than the cost of funding sources as short-term interest rates approached zero. The mix of interest-earning assets also negatively affected net interest revenue – most notably the decrease in the average balance of margin loans resulted in a higher average balance of cash and investments segregated, a lower yielding asset category. The effect of the low interest rate environment and asset mix was partially offset by the growth in average balances. The Company experienced significant growth in deposits from banking clients, which in turn funded increases in the average balances of securities available for sale, loans to banking clients, and cash and cash equivalents. Trading Revenue Trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenue is affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. Principal transaction revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from client fixed income securities trading activity. Factors that influence principal transaction revenue include the volume of client trades and market price volatility. - 22 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Trading revenue decreased by $166 million, or 17%, in 2010 from 2009 and by $84 million, or 8%, in 2009 from 2008 due to lower average revenue per revenue trade resulting from improved online trade pricing for clients and lower daily average revenue trades, as trading volume and market volatility eased from 2008 levels. As shown in the following table, daily average revenue trades decreased 5% in 2010. The decrease was primarily due to lower volumes of equity and principal transaction trades, partially offset by a higher volume of option trades. Average revenue per revenue trade decreased 11% in 2010, primarily due to lower online equity trade commissions, which were implemented in January 2010. Daily average revenue trades decreased 2% in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to lower volumes of principal transaction and mutual fund trades. Average revenue per revenue trade decreased 5% in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to lower average revenue per revenue trade for principal transactions and mutual funds, partially offset by higher average revenue per revenue trade for option securities. Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate2009-2010 2010 2009 2008 Daily average revenue trades (1) (in thousands) (5 %) 270.7 285.8 292.6 Number of trading days — 251.5 251.0 251.5 Average revenue per revenue trade (11 %) $ 12.28 $ 13.86 $ 14.53 (1) Includes all client trades that generate trading revenue (i.e., commission revenue or revenue from fixed income securities trading). Other Revenue Other revenue includes gains on the repurchases of long-term debt, realized gains and losses on sales of securities available for sale, gains and losses on sales of loans held for sale, service fees, and software maintenance fees. Other revenue decreased by $40 million, or 23%, in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a gain of $31 million on the repurchase of a portion of the Company’s long-term debt in 2009. Other revenue increased by $81 million, or 86%, in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the gain on the repurchase of long-term debt in 2009 previously discussed and a realized loss of $29 million on the sale of a corporate debt security in 2008. Provision for Loan Losses The provision for loan losses decreased by $11 million, or 29%, in 2010 from 2009, primarily due to stabilization in the levels of loan delinquencies and nonaccrual loans in 2010 compared to 2009, partially offset by growth in the Company’s residential real estate mortgage and HELOC portfolios. The provision for loan losses increased by $21 million, or 124%, in 2009 from 2008, primarily due to higher loan delinquencies and nonaccrual loans, as well as growth in the Company’s loan portfolio. Charge-offs were $20 million, $13 million, and $4 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. For further discussion on the Company’s credit risk and the allowance for loan losses, see “Risk Management – Credit Risk” and “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 7. Loans to Banking Clients and Related Allowance for Loan Losses.” Net Impairment Losses on Securities Net impairment losses on securities were $36 million and $60 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and related to certain non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities in the Company’s available for sale portfolio. These charges resulted from credit deterioration of the securities’ underlying collateral. In 2008, the Company recognized an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $44 million on a corporate debt security issued by Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (Lehman) as a result of Lehman’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition filing in September 2008 and subsequently sold the security in the following month. This security was held in the Company’s available for sale portfolio. For further discussion, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 6. Securities Available for Sale and Securities Held to Maturity.” - 23 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Expenses Excluding Interest As shown in the table below, expenses excluding interest increased in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to the recognition of class action litigation and regulatory reserves relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund and losses recognized by Schwab money market mutual funds. Expenses excluding interest also increased in 2010 due to increases in professional services expense and other expense, partially offset by a decrease in occupancy and equipment expense. Expenses excluding interest decreased in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to decreases in compensation and benefits expense, professional services expense, and advertising and market development expense.

Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits expense includes salaries and wages, incentive compensation, and related employee benefits and taxes. Incentive compensation primarily includes variable compensation and discretionary bonus costs. Variable compensation includes payments to certain individuals based on their sales performance. Discretionary bonus costs are based on the Company’s overall performance as measured by earnings per share, and therefore will fluctuate with this measure. In 2009 and 2008, discretionary bonus costs were based on the achievement of specified performance objectives, including revenue growth and pre-tax profit margin. - 24 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Compensation and benefits expense increased by $29 million, or 2%, in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation. Compensation and benefits expense decreased by $123 million, or 7%, in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to decreases in salaries and wages expense and incentive compensation. The following table shows a comparison of certain compensation and benefits components and employee data: Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate2009-2010 2010 2009 2008 Salaries and wages — $ 931 $ 930 $ 1,020 Incentive compensation (1) 9 % 386 355 402 Employee benefits and other (1 %) 256 259 245 Total compensation and benefits expense 2 % $ 1,573 $ 1,544 $ 1,667 Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total net revenues: Salaries and wages 22 % 22 % 20 % Incentive compensation 9 % 8 % 8 % Employee benefits and other 6 % 7 % 4 % Total compensation and benefits expense 37 % 37 % 32 % Full-time equivalent employees (in thousands) (2) At year end 3 % 12.8 12.4 13.4 Average 2 % 12.6 12.4 13.5 (1) Includes variable compensation, discretionary bonus costs, and stock-based compensation. (2) Includes full-time, part-time and temporary employees, and persons employed on a contract basis, and excludes employees of outsourced service providers. Salaries and wages were relatively flat in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to increases in persons employed on a contract basis and full-time employees, offset by severance expense of $58 million in 2009 relating to the Company’s cost reduction measures. Incentive compensation increased in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to higher variable compensation resulting from product sales performance in the Company’s branch offices and higher stock-based compensation relating to the amortization of its stock options and restricted stock units. Salaries and wages decreased in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to decreases in full-time employees and persons employed on a contract basis, offset by severance expense of $58 million relating to the Company’s cost reduction measures. Incentive compensation decreased in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to lower variable compensation as a result of lower product sales performance in the Company’s branch offices. In addition, incentive compensation in 2008 included long-term incentive plan compensation. The last performance period under the Company’s long-term incentive program ended on December 31, 2008. Expenses Excluding Compensation and Benefits Professional services expense increased in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to increases in fees relating to technology services and enhancements, and investment advisor fees relating to the Company’s managed account service programs. Professional services expense decreased in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to a curtailment of certain technology projects. Occupancy and equipment expense decreased in 2010 from 2009 and increased in 2009 from 2008, primarily due to facilities charges of $43 million in 2009 relating to the Company’s cost reduction measures. Advertising and market development expense decreased in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to lower media spending relating to the Company’s “Talk to Chuck™” national advertising campaign. Media spending and marketing expense decreased by $39 million and $13 million, respectively, in 2009 from 2008. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. - 25 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) In 2010, the Company recognized class action litigation and regulatory reserves of $320 million relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund. For further discussion of the Schwab YieldPlus Fund litigation and regulatory matters, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.” In 2010, the Company decided to cover the net remaining losses recognized by Schwab money market mutual funds as a result of their investments in a single structured investment vehicle that defaulted in 2008 and recorded a charge of $132 million. Other expense increased in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to a charge of $30 million in 2010, as the Company ended its sponsorship in its Invest First and WorldPoints Visa credit cards as a result of challenging credit card industry economics. Other expense also increased in 2010 due to an increase in employee travel expenses. Other expense increased in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to a $16 million FDIC special industry assessment and higher FDIC insurance premiums caused by higher deposits from banking clients, partially offset by a decrease in employee travel expenses and insurance recovery of certain costs incurred in 2008. Taxes on Income The Company’s effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations before taxes was 41.7% in 2010, 38.3% in 2009, and 39.3% in 2008. The increase in 2010 from 2009 reflects the impact of non-deductible penalties relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund regulatory settlements. The decrease in 2009 from 2008 was primarily due to lower effective state income tax rates. Segment Information The Company provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments – Investor Services and Institutional Services. The Investor Services segment includes the Company’s retail client offering. The Institutional Services segment provides custodial, trading, and support services to independent investment advisors, as well as retirement plan services, plan administrator services, equity compensation plan services, and mutual fund clearing services. In addition, the Institutional Services segment supports the availability of Schwab proprietary mutual funds and collective trust funds on third-party platforms. Banking revenues and expenses are allocated to the Company’s two segments based on which segment services the client. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments on a pre-tax basis, excluding items such as impairment charges on non-financial assets, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and significant restructuring and other charges. Segment assets and liabilities are not disclosed because the balances are not used for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments. - 26 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Financial information for the Company’s reportable segments is presented in the following tables: Investor Services Institutional Services Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate2010-2009 2010 2009 2008 Growth Rate2010-2009 2010 2009 2008 Net Revenues: Asset management and administration fees 1 % $ 976 $ 968 $ 1,293 (7 %) $ 846 $ 907 $ 1,062 Net interest revenue 23 % 1,297 1,058 1,398 21 % 227 187 283 Trading revenue (18 %) 557 679 725 (14 %) 273 317 355 Other (25 %) 70 93 24 (21 %) 65 82 60 Provision for loan losses (32 %) (23 ) (34 ) (15 ) — (4 ) (4 ) (2 ) Net impairment losses on securities (41 %) (32 ) (54 ) (40 ) (33 %) (4 ) (6 ) (4 ) Total net revenues 5 % 2,845 2,710 3,385 (5 %) 1,403 1,483 1,754 Expenses Excluding Interest 8 % 2,065 1,906 2,107 3 % 960 929 1,001 Income from continuing operations before taxes on income (3 %) $ 780 $ 804 $ 1,278 (20 %) $ 443 $ 554 $ 753 Unallocated Total Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate2010-2009 2010 2009 2008 Growth Rate2010-2009 2010 2009 2008 Net Revenues: Asset management and administration fees — $ — $ — $ — (3 %) $ 1,822 $ 1,875 $ 2,355 Net interest revenue — — — 1 22 % 1,524 1,245 1,682 Trading revenue — — — — (17 %) 830 996 1,080 Other — — — 10 (23 %) 135 175 94 Provision for loan losses — — — — (29 %) (27 ) (38 ) (17 ) Net impairment losses on securities — — — — (40 %) (36 ) (60 ) (44 ) Total net revenues — — — 11 1 % 4,248 4,193 5,150 Expenses Excluding Interest N/M 444 82 14 19 % 3,469 2,917 3,122 Income from continuing operations before taxes on income N/M $ (444 ) $ (82 ) (3 ) (39 %) $ 779 $ 1,276 $ 2,028 Taxes on income (34 %) (325 ) (489 ) (798 ) Income from continuing operations (42 %) 454 787 1,230 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax — — — (18 ) Net Income (42 %) $ 454 $ 787 $ 1,212 N/M Not meaningful.

While the low interest rate environment caused additional money market mutual fund fee waivers from 2009, asset management and administration fees were relatively flat due to higher average asset valuations and continued asset inflows. Expenses excluding interest increased by $159 million, or 8%, in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits, professional services, and other expenses. Other expense includes a charge relating to the Company’s termination of its sponsorship in its Invest First and WorldPoints Visa credit cards in 2010 as a result of challenging credit card economics. Net revenues decreased by $675 million, or 20%, in 2009 from 2008 due to decreases in asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue, partially offset by an increase in other revenue. Asset management and administration fees decreased primarily due to lower average asset valuations and money market mutual fund fee waivers. Net interest revenue decreased as a result of the low interest rate environment, partially offset by higher average balances of interest-earning assets. The increase in other revenue was primarily due to the recognition of a gain on the repurchase of a portion of the Company’s long-term debt. In addition, other revenue in 2008 included a loss on the sale of a corporate debt security held in the Company’s available for sale portfolio. Net revenues were also negatively impacted by net impairment charges relating to certain residential mortgage-backed securities in the Company’s available for sale portfolio. Expenses excluding interest decreased by $201 million, or 10%, in 2009 from 2008, primarily due to lower compensation and benefits, professional services, and advertising and market development expenses. Institutional Services Net revenues decreased by $80 million, or 5%, in 2010 from 2009 due to decreases in asset management and administration fees, trading revenue, and other revenue, offset by an increase in net interest revenue. Asset management and administration fees decreased primarily due to money market mutual fund fee waivers, partially offset by the effect of higher average asset valuations and continued asset inflows. Additionally, in August 2010 management transferred client assets associated with the Schwab Advisor Network to the Investor Services segment and started recording the related asset management and administration fee revenue to that segment. Trading revenue decreased due to lower average revenue per revenue trade resulting from improved online trade pricing for clients, which was implemented in January 2010, and slightly lower daily average revenue trades in 2010. Other revenue was lower in comparison to 2009 due to a gain on the repurchase of a portion of the Company’s long-term debt in 2009. Net interest revenue increased due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in the average yield earned. Expenses excluding interest increased by $31 million, or 3%, in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense. Net revenues decreased by $271 million, or 15%, in 2009 from 2008 due to decreases in asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue, partially offset by an increase in other revenue. Asset management and administration fees decreased primarily due to lower average asset valuations and money market mutual fund fee waivers. Net interest revenue decreased as a result of the low interest rate environment, partially offset by higher average balances of interest-earning assets. Trading revenue decreased due to lower daily average revenue trades and lower average revenue per revenue trade. Net impairment losses on securities increased due to credit deterioration of certain mortgage-backed securities’ underlying collateral. The increase in other revenue was primarily due to the recognition of a gain on the repurchase of a portion of the Company’s long-term debt. Expenses excluding interest decreased by $72 million, or 7%, in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to lower compensation and benefits and professional services expenses, partially offset by an increase in other expense. Unallocated Expenses excluding interest in 2010 primarily include the recognition of certain significant charges. The Company recognized class action litigation and regulatory reserves relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund and a charge relating to its decision to cover the net remaining losses recognized by Schwab money market mutual funds as a result of their investments in a single structured investment vehicle that defaulted in 2008. Expenses excluding interest in 2009 include facilities and severance charges relating to the Company’s cost reduction measures. - 28 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Discontinued Operations In July 2007, the Company sold all of the outstanding common stock of U.S. Trust. In connection with the determination of the final income tax gain on the sale of U.S. Trust, the Company recorded additional tax expense of $18 million in 2008, which is included in loss from discontinued operations in the Company’s consolidated statements of income.

The Company’s capital structure is designed to provide each subsidiary with capital and liquidity to meet its operational needs and regulatory requirements. CSC is a savings and loan holding company and Schwab Bank, CSC’s depository institution, is a federal savings bank. CSC and Schwab Bank are both currently subject to supervision and regulation by the Office of Thrift Supervision. Liquidity CSC As a savings and loan holding company, CSC is not subject to specific statutory capital requirements. However, CSC is required to maintain capital that is sufficient to support the holding company and its subsidiaries’ business activities, and the risks inherent in those activities. To manage capital adequacy, CSC currently utilizes a target Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, of at least 6%. At December 31, 2010, CSC’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 6.5%. CSC’s liquidity needs are generally met through cash generated by its subsidiaries, as well as cash provided by external financing. CSC has a universal automatic shelf registration statement (Shelf Registration Statement) on file with the SEC which enables CSC to issue debt, equity and other securities. CSC maintains excess liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments to cover daily funding needs and to support growth in the Company’s business. Generally, CSC does not hold liquidity at its subsidiaries in excess of amounts deemed sufficient to support the subsidiaries’ operations, including any regulatory capital requirements. Schwab and Schwab Bank are subject to regulatory requirements that may restrict them from certain transactions with CSC. Management believes that funds generated by the operations of CSC’s subsidiaries will continue to be the primary funding source in meeting CSC’s liquidity needs, providing adequate liquidity to meet Schwab Bank’s capital guidelines, and maintaining Schwab’s net capital. CSC has liquidity needs that arise from its Senior Medium-Term Notes, Series A (Medium-Term Notes), Junior Subordinated Notes, and Senior Notes, as well as from the funding of cash dividends, acquisitions, and other investments. The Medium-Term Notes, of which $250 million were outstanding at December 31, 2010, mature in 2017 and have a fixed interest rate of 6.375% with interest payable semi-annually. The Medium-Term Notes are rated A2 by Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), A by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group (Standard & Poor’s), and A by Fitch Ratings, Ltd. (Fitch). At December 31, 2010, $202 million of Junior Subordinated Notes, which mature in 2067, were outstanding and have a fixed interest rate of 7.50% until 2017 and a floating rate thereafter. The Junior Subordinated Notes are not rated, however the trust preferred securities related to these notes are rated Baa1 by Moody’s, BBB+ by Standard & Poor’s, and BBB+ by Fitch. In the third quarter of 2010, the Company issued $700 million of Senior Notes under the Shelf Registration Statement. At December 31, 2010, total Senior Notes outstanding were $1.5 billion, with maturities ranging from 2014 to 2020 and fixed interest rates ranging from 4.45% to 4.950% with interest payable semi-annually. The Senior Notes are rated A2 by Moody’s, A by Standard & Poor’s, and A by Fitch. In January 2010, the Company completed an equity offering of 29,670,300 shares of its common stock under the Shelf Registration Statement. Net proceeds received from the offering were $543 million and were used to support the Company’s balance sheet growth. - 29 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) CSC has authorization from its Board of Directors to issue unsecured commercial paper notes (Commercial Paper Notes) not to exceed $1.5 billion. Management has set a current limit for the commercial paper program of $800 million. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes may vary, but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper is not redeemable prior to maturity and cannot be voluntarily prepaid. The proceeds of the commercial paper program are to be used for general corporate purposes. There were no borrowings of Commercial Paper Notes during 2010. CSC’s ratings for these short-term borrowings are P1 by Moody’s, A1 by Standard & Poor’s, and F1 by Fitch. CSC maintains an $800 million committed, unsecured credit facility with a group of twelve banks, which is scheduled to expire in June 2011. This facility replaced a similar facility that expired in June 2010. These facilities were unused in 2010. The funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes, including repayment of the Commercial Paper Notes discussed above. The financial covenants under this facility require Schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, as defined, Schwab Bank to be well capitalized, as defined, and CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity. At December 31, 2010, the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was $4.4 billion. Management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on CSC’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements. CSC also has direct access to $704 million of the $829 million uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines discussed below, that are primarily utilized by Schwab to manage short-term liquidity. These lines were not used in 2010. In addition, Schwab provides CSC with a $1.0 billion credit facility maturing in December 2011. No funds were drawn under this facility at December 31, 2010. Schwab Schwab is subject to regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit Schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings from CSC, paying cash dividends, or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees if such payment would result in net capital of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000. At December 31, 2010, Schwab’s net capital was $1.2 billion (9% of aggregate debit balances), which was $930 million in excess of its minimum required net capital and $553 million in excess of 5% of aggregate debit balances. Most of Schwab’s assets are readily convertible to cash, consisting primarily of short-term (i.e., less than 150 days) investment-grade, interest-earning investments (the majority of which are segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients pursuant to regulatory requirements), receivables from brokerage clients, and receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations. Client margin loans are demand loan obligations secured by readily marketable securities. Receivables from and payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations primarily represent current open transactions, which usually settle, or can be closed out, within a few business days. Liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts, which were $29.9 billion and $25.3 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for Schwab in the future. Schwab has a finance lease obligation related to an office building and land under a 20-year lease. The remaining finance lease obligation of $106 million at December 31, 2010, is being reduced by a portion of the lease payments over the remaining lease term of 14 years. To manage short-term liquidity, Schwab maintains uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines with a group of seven banks totaling $829 million at December 31, 2010. The need for short-term borrowings arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest-earnings investments, and movements of cash to meet - 30 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) regulatory cash segregation requirements. Schwab used such borrowings for 25 days in 2010, with average daily amounts borrowed of $28 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2010. To partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), Schwab has unsecured standby letter of credit agreements (LOCs) with seven banks in favor of the OCC aggregating $445 million at December 31, 2010. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. Schwab satisfies the collateral requirements by arranging LOCs, in favor of these brokerage clients, which are issued by multiple banks. At December 31, 2010, the aggregate face amount of these LOCs totaled $37 million. There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs during 2010. To manage Schwab’s regulatory capital requirement, CSC provides Schwab with a $1.4 billion subordinated revolving credit facility which is scheduled to expire in March 2012. The amount outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2010, was $220 million. Borrowings under this subordinated lending arrangement qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab. In addition, CSC provides Schwab with a $1.5 billion credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in December 2011. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab. At December 31, 2010, $45 million was outstanding under this facility, which was subsequently repaid on January 3, 2011. Schwab Bank Schwab Bank is required to maintain minimum capital levels as specified in federal banking laws and regulations. Failure to meet the minimum levels will result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on Schwab Bank. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2010, Schwab Bank is considered well capitalized. Schwab Bank’s regulatory capital and ratios at December 31, 2010, are as follows: Actual Minimum CapitalRequirement Minimum to beWell Capitalized Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital $ 4,157 23.7 % $ 702 4.0 % $ 1,053 6.0 % Total Risk-Based Capital $ 4,209 24.0 % $ 1,404 8.0 % $ 1,755 10.0 % Tier 1 Core Capital $ 4,157 7.6 % $ 2,195 4.0 % $ 2,744 5.0 % Tangible Equity $ 4,157 7.6 % $ 1,098 2.0 % N/A N/A Not applicable. Beginning in 2010, in light of the evolving regulatory environment and capitalization trends observed across the banking industry, management established a target Tier 1 Core Capital Ratio for Schwab Bank of at least 7.5%. Schwab Bank’s current liquidity needs are generally met through deposits from banking clients and equity capital. The excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts is swept into deposit accounts at Schwab Bank. At December 31, 2010, these balances totaled $31.0 billion. Schwab Bank has access to traditional funding sources such as deposits, federal funds purchased, and repurchase agreements. Additionally, Schwab Bank has access to short-term funding through the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) discount window. Amounts available under the FRB discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain of Schwab Bank’s securities available for sale and securities held to maturity that are pledged as collateral. At December 31, 2010, $1.1 billion was available under this arrangement. There were no funds drawn under this arrangement during 2010. Schwab Bank maintains a credit facility with the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Amounts available under this facility are dependent on the amount of Schwab Bank’s residential real estate mortgages and HELOCs that are pledged as collateral. At December 31, 2010, $4.1 billion was available under this facility. There were no funds drawn under this facility during 2010. - 31 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) CSC provides Schwab Bank with a $100 million short-term credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in December 2011. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab Bank. There were no funds drawn under this facility during 2010. Capital Resources The Company monitors both the relative composition and absolute level of its capital structure. Management is focused on limiting the Company’s use of capital and currently targets a long-term debt to total financial capital ratio not to exceed 30%. The Company’s total financial capital (long-term debt plus stockholders’ equity) at December 31, 2010, was $8.2 billion, up $1.6 billion, or 25%, from December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010, the Company had long-term debt of $2.0 billion, or 24% of total financial capital, that bears interest at a weighted-average rate of 5.24%. At December 31, 2009, the Company had long-term debt of $1.5 billion, or 23% of total financial capital. In the third quarter of 2010, the Company issued $700 million of additional Senior Notes that mature in 2020 and have a fixed interest rate of 4.45%. The Company repaid $205 million of long-term debt in 2010, which included the maturity of $200 million of Medium-Term Notes. In 2009, the Company issued $750 million of Senior Notes that mature in 2014 and have a fixed interest rate of 4.950%. The Company repaid $13 million of long-term debt in 2009. In addition, the Company repurchased $98 million of trust preferred securities related to its Junior Subordinated Notes for a cash payment of $67 million in 2009, which resulted in a gain of $31 million. The Company’s cash position (reported as cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated balance sheet) and cash flows are affected by changes in brokerage client cash balances and the associated amounts required to be segregated under regulatory guidelines. Timing differences between cash and investments actually segregated on a given date and the amount required to be segregated for that date may arise in the ordinary course of business and are addressed by the Company in accordance with applicable regulations. Other factors which affect the Company’s cash position and cash flows include investment activity in securities, levels of capital expenditures, acquisition and divestiture activity, banking client deposit activity, brokerage and banking client loan activity, financing activity in long-term debt, payments of dividends, and repurchases and issuances of CSC’s common stock. The combination of these factors can cause significant fluctuations in the cash position during specific time periods. Capital Expenditures The Company’s capital expenditures were $127 million in 2010 and $139 million in 2009. Capital expenditures as a percentage of net revenues were 3% in 2010 and 2009. Capital expenditures in 2010 were primarily for software and equipment relating to the Company’s information technology systems, leasehold improvements, and capitalized costs for developing internal-use software. Capital expenditures in 2009 were primarily for leasehold improvements, software and equipment relating to the Company’s information technology systems, and building improvements. Management currently anticipates that 2011 capital expenditures will be approximately 35% higher than 2010 spending primarily due to increased spending on software and equipment relating to the Company’s information systems and furniture and equipment. As has been the case in recent years, the Company may adjust its capital expenditures periodically as business conditions change. Management believes that funds generated by its operations will continue to be the primary funding source of its capital expenditures. Equity Offering On January 26, 2010, the Company completed the sale of 29,670,300 shares of its common stock, $.01 par value, at a public offering price of $19.00 per share. Net proceeds received from the offering were $543 million and were used to support the Company’s balance sheet growth, including expansion of its deposit base and migration of certain client balances from money market funds into deposit accounts at Schwab Bank. - 32 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Dividends CSC paid common stock cash dividends of $288 million and $279 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Since the initial dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 87 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend rate 19 times, including a 20% increase in the third quarter of 2008. Since 1989, dividends have increased by a 26% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. CSC paid common stock dividends of $.24, $.24, and $.22 per share in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, the Company currently targets its cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income. Share Repurchases There were no repurchases of CSC’s common stock in 2010 or 2009. As of December 31, 2010, CSC had remaining authority from the Board of Directors to repurchase up to $596 million of its common stock. Business Acquisition On November 9, 2010, the Company completed its acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Windward for $106 million in common stock and $44 million in cash. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements The Company enters into various off-balance-sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of its clients. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, the Company enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For information on each of these arrangements, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.” - 33 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Contractual Obligations The Company’s principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010, are shown in the following table. Management believes that funds generated by its continuing operations, as well as cash provided by external financing, will continue to be the primary funding sources in meeting these obligations. Excluded from this table are liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet that are generally short-term in nature (e.g., payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations) or without contractual payment terms (e.g., deposits from banking clients, payables to brokerage clients, and deferred compensation).

RISK MANAGEMENT Overview The Company’s business activities expose it to a variety of risks including technology, operations, credit, market, liquidity, legal, and reputational risk. Identification and management of these risks are essential to the success and financial soundness of the Company. Senior management takes an active role in the Company’s risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling various risks. Oversight of risk management has been delegated to the Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior managers of major business and control functions. The Global Risk Committee is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the Company’s risk exposures and leading the continued development of the Company’s risk management policies and practices. Functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report into the Global Risk Committee. These sub-committees include the: • Corporate Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee, which focuses on the Company’s liquidity, capital resources, interest rate risk, and investments; • Credit and Market Risk Oversight Committee, which focuses on the credit exposures resulting from client activity (e.g., margin lending activities and loans to banking clients), the investing activities of certain of the Company’s proprietary funds, corporate credit activities (e.g., counterparty and corporate investing activities), and market risk resulting from the Company taking positions in certain securities to facilitate client trading activity; - 34 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) • Information Security and Privacy Steering Committee, which oversees information security and privacy programs and policies; • Investment Management and ERISA Risk Committee, which oversees activities in which the Company and its principals operate in an investment advisory capacity or as an ERISA fiduciary; • Investment Products Review Board, which provides senior level oversight of investment products and services made available to clients; and • Operations Risk Committee, which focuses on risks relating to potential inadequate or failed internal processes or systems and from external events and relationships (e.g., vendors and business partners). The Global Risk Committee reports regularly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Audit Committee), which reviews major risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The Company’s Disclosure Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s (a) disclosure controls and procedures and (b) internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The Company’s compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and risk and credit management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring the Company’s risk management. Risk is inherent in the Company’s business. Consequently, despite the Company’s efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer unexpected losses due to operating or other risks. The following discussion highlights the Company’s policies and procedures for identification, assessment, and management of the principal areas of risk in its operations. Technology and Operating Risk Technology and operating risk is the potential for loss due to deficiencies in control processes or technology systems that constrain the Company’s ability to gather, process and communicate information and process client transactions efficiently and securely, without interruptions. The Company’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and the Company’s success depends, in part, on its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its technology in anticipation of evolving client needs. To the extent the Company experiences system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to its systems, linkages with third-party systems, and power failures), the Company’s business and operations could be significantly negatively impacted. To minimize business interruptions, Schwab has two data centers intended, in part, to further improve the recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency. The Company is committed to an ongoing process of upgrading, enhancing, and testing its technology systems. This effort is focused on meeting client needs, meeting market and regulatory changes, and deploying standardized technology platforms. Technology and operating risk also includes the risk of human error, employee misconduct, external fraud, computer viruses, distributed denial of service attacks, terrorist attacks, and natural disaster. Employee misconduct could include fraud and misappropriation of client or Company assets, improper use or disclosure of confidential client or Company information, and unauthorized activities, such as transactions exceeding acceptable risks or authorized limits. External fraud includes misappropriation of client or Company assets by third parties, including through unauthorized access to Company systems and data and client accounts. The frequency and sophistication of such fraud attempts continue to increase. The Company has specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and uses periodic risk self-assessments and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The Company maintains backup and recovery functions, including facilities for backup and communications, and conducts periodic testing of disaster recovery plans. The Company also maintains policies and procedures and technology to protect against fraud and unauthorized access to systems and data. - 35 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Despite the Company’s risk management efforts, it is not always possible to deter or prevent technological or operational failure, or fraud or other misconduct, and the precautions taken by the Company may not be effective in all cases. The Company may be subject to litigation, losses, and regulatory actions in such cases, and may be required to expend significant additional resources to remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures. The Company also faces technology and operating risk when it employs the services of various external vendors, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, and support functions. The Company manages its exposure to external vendor risk through contractual provisions, control standards, and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance. The Company maintains policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with Company data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-public client information. The Company clearly defines for employees, contractors, and vendors the Company’s expected standards of care for confidential data. Regular training is provided by the Company in regard to data security. The Company is actively engaged in the research and development of new technologies, services, and products. The Company endeavors to protect its research and development efforts, and its brands, through the use of copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and contracts. Credit Risk Credit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations. The Company’s direct exposure to credit risk mainly results from margin lending activities, securities lending activities, mortgage lending activities, its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities, and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds that the Company sponsors. To manage the risks of such losses, the Company has established policies and procedures which include: establishing and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin requirements for certain securities. Most of the Company’s credit extensions are supported by collateral arrangements. Collateral arrangements relating to margin loans, securities lending agreements, and resale agreements include provisions that require additional collateral in the event that market fluctuations result in declines in the value of collateral received. The Company’s credit risk exposure related to loans to banking clients is actively managed through individual and portfolio reviews performed by management. Management regularly reviews asset quality including concentrations, delinquencies, nonperforming loans, losses, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for loan losses, which is reviewed quarterly by senior management. The Company’s mortgage loan portfolios primarily include first lien residential mortgage loans (First Mortgage portfolio) of $4.7 billion and home equity lines of credit (HELOC portfolio) of $3.5 billion at December 31, 2010. The Company’s First Mortgage portfolio underwriting requirements are generally consistent with the underwriting requirements in the secondary market for loan portfolios. The Company’s guidelines include maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Issac & Company (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan is conforming or jumbo). These credit underwriting standards have limited the exposure to the types of loans that experienced high foreclosures and loss rates elsewhere in the industry during 2010 and 2009. There have been no significant changes to the LTV ratio or FICO credit score guidelines related to the Company’s First Mortgage or HELOC portfolios during 2010. At December 31, 2010, the weighted-average originated LTV ratios were 60% and 59% for the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, respectively. The computation of the origination LTV ratio for a HELOC includes any first lien mortgage outstanding on the same property at the time of origination. At December 31, 2010, 21% of HELOCs ($742 million of the HELOC portfolio) were in a first lien position. The weighted-average originated FICO credit scores were 764 and 768 for the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, respectively, at December 31, 2010. The Company does not offer loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO credit score of less than 620 at origination), unless the - 36 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) borrower has compensating credit factors. At December 31, 2010, approximately 2% of both the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios consisted of loans to borrowers with FICO credit scores of less than 620. The following table presents certain of the Company’s loan quality metrics as a percentage of total outstanding loans: December 31, 2010 2009 Loan delinquencies (1) 0.96 % 0.87 % Nonaccrual loans 0.58 % 0.46 % Allowance for loan losses 0.60 % 0.61 % (1) Loan delinquencies are defined as loans that are 30 days or more past due. The Company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale and securities held to maturity portfolios, whose fair values totaled $24.0 billion and $17.8 billion at December 31, 2010, respectively. These portfolios include U.S. agency and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, U.S. agency notes, corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities, and certificates of deposit. U.S. agency residential mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings, however management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. agencies. Included in non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities are securities collateralized by loans that are considered to be “Prime” (defined by the Company as loans to borrowers with a FICO credit score of 620 or higher at origination), and “Alt-A” (defined by the Company as Prime loans with reduced documentation at origination). The table below presents the credit ratings for U.S. agency and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities available for sale and securities held to maturity, including Prime and Alt-A residential mortgage-backed securities, by year of origination. In some instances securities have divergent ratings from Moody’s, Fitch, or Standard & Poor’s. In these instances, the Company has used the lowest rating as of December 31, 2010, for purposes of presenting the table below. Residential mortgage-backed securities, particularly Alt-A securities, experienced continued deteriorating credit characteristics, including increased payment delinquencies, in 2010.

Schwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab’s client or a counterparty fails to meet its obligations to Schwab. Concentration Risk The Company has exposure to concentration risk when holding large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry. The fair value of the Company’s investments in residential mortgage-backed securities totaled $31.4 billion at December 31, 2010. Of these, $29.9 billion were U.S. agency securities and $1.5 billion were non-agency securities. The U.S. agency securities are included in securities available for sale and securities held to maturity and the non-agency securities are included in securities available for sale. Included in non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities are securities collateralized by Alt-A loans. At December 31, 2010, the amortized cost and fair value of Alt-A mortgage-backed securities were $489 million and $359 million, respectively. The Company’s investments in corporate debt securities and commercial paper totaled $4.6 billion at December 31, 2010, with the majority issued by institutions in the financial services industry. These securities are included in securities available for sale, securities held to maturity, cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes, cash and cash equivalents, and other securities owned in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2010, the Company held $1.9 billion of corporate debt securities issued by financial institutions and guaranteed under the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. The Company’s loans to banking clients include $4.7 billion of adjustable rate first lien residential real estate mortgage loans at December 31, 2010. The Company’s adjustable rate mortgages have initial fixed interest rates for three to ten years and interest rates that adjust annually thereafter. Approximately 65% of these mortgages consisted of loans with interest-only payment terms. The interest rates on approximately 70% of these interest-only loans are not scheduled to reset for three or more years. The Company’s interest-only loans do not include interest terms described as temporary introductory rates below current market rates. At December 31, 2010, 42% of the residential real estate mortgages and 49% of the HELOC balances were secured by properties which are located in California. The Company also has exposure to concentration risk from its margin and securities lending activities collateralized by securities of a single issuer or industry. The Company has indirect exposure to U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral to secure its resale agreements. The Company’s primary credit exposure on these resale transactions is with its counterparty. The Company would have exposure to the U.S. Government and agency securities only in the event of the counterparty’s default on the resale agreements. U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral for resale agreements totaled $13.0 billion at December 31, 2010. Market Risk Market risk is the potential for changes in revenue or the value of financial instruments held by the Company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices or market conditions. For discussion of the Company’s market risk, see “Item 7A – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” - 38 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Fiduciary Risk Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. The Company attempts to manage this risk by establishing procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees. Legal and Regulatory Risk The Company faces significant legal and compliance risk in its business, and the volume of litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services firms and the amount of damages claimed have been increasing. Among other things, these risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for Company products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of the Company’s controls. Claims against the Company may increase due to a variety of factors, such as if clients suffer losses during a period of deteriorating equity market conditions, as the Company increases the level of advice it provides to clients, and as the Company enhances the services it provides to IAs. In addition, the Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, and SROs, and such regulation is becoming increasingly extensive and complex. The Company attempts to manage legal and compliance risk through policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid litigation claims and prevent or detect violations of applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, client privacy, employment policies, and contracts management. Despite the Company’s efforts to maintain an effective compliance program and internal controls, legal breaches and rule violations could result in reputational harm, significant losses and disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on the Company’s business activities. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company uses fair value measurements to record certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value, and to determine fair value disclosures. All of these assets were measured at fair value using quoted prices or market-based information and accordingly were classified as Level 1 or Level 2 measurements in accordance with the fair value hierarchy described in fair value measurement accounting guidance. Liabilities recorded at fair value were not material at December 31, 2010 or 2009. See “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 16. Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities” for more information on the Company’s assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. When available, the Company uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets. When quoted prices do not exist, the Company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets. The Company validates prices received from pricing services using various methods, including comparison to prices received from additional pricing services, comparison to available quoted market prices, internal valuation models, and review of other relevant market data. The Company does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in a material difference in the recorded amounts. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company did not adjust prices received from independent third-party pricing services. - 39 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. While the majority of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position and reported financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy. Other-than-Temporary Impairment of Securities Available for Sale and Securities Held to Maturity: Management evaluates whether securities available for sale and securities held to maturity are other-than-temporarily impaired (OTTI) on a quarterly basis. Debt securities with unrealized losses are considered OTTI if the Company intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such security prior to any anticipated recovery. If management determines that a security is OTTI under these circumstances, the impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the entire difference between the amortized cost and the then-current fair value. A security is also OTTI if management does not expect to recover the amortized cost of the security. In this circumstance, management utilizes cash flow models to estimate the expected future cash flow from the securities and to estimate the credit loss. The impairment recognized in earnings is measured by the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost of the security. Expected cash flows are discounted using the security’s effective interest rate. The evaluation of whether the Company expects to recover the amortized cost of a security is inherently judgmental. The evaluation includes the assessment of several bond performance indicators including: the portion of the underlying loans that are delinquent (30 days, 60 days, 90+ days), in bankruptcy, in foreclosure or converted to real estate owned; the actual amount of loss incurred on the underlying loans in which the property has been foreclosed and sold; the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security available to absorb credit losses on the underlying loans; the current credit ratings issued by either Standard & Poor’s, Fitch Ratings, or Moody’s; the current price and magnitude of the unrealized loss; and whether the Company has received all scheduled principal and interest payments. Management uses cash flow models to further assess the likelihood of other-than-temporary impairment for the Company’s non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. To develop the cash flow models, the Company uses forecasted loss severity, prepayment speeds (i.e. the rate at which the principal on underlying loans are paid down), and default rates over the securities’ expected remaining maturities. Valuation of Goodwill: The Company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually, or whenever indications of impairment exist. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, resulting in an impairment charge for this excess. The Company has elected April 1st as its annual goodwill impairment testing date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on April 1, 2010, management estimated the fair value of each of the Company’s reporting units (generally defined as the Company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) and compared this value to the carrying value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and therefore management concluded that no amount of goodwill was impaired. The estimated fair value of the reporting units was established using a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit. Adverse changes in the Company’s planned business operations such as unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit, or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the Company’s recorded goodwill. Allowance for Loan Losses: The adequacy of the allowance is reviewed quarterly by management, taking into consideration current economic conditions, the existing loan portfolio composition, past loss experience, and risks inherent in the portfolio. The process to establish an allowance for loan losses utilizes loan-level statistical models that estimate prepayments, defaults, and probable losses for the loan portfolios based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the portfolios. The - 40 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) methodology considers the effects of borrower behavior and a variety of factors including, but not limited to, interest rates, housing price movements as measured by a housing price index, economic conditions, estimated defaults and foreclosures measured by historical and expected delinquencies, changes in prepayment speeds, loan-to-value ratios, past loss experience, estimates of future loss severities, borrower credit risk measured by FICO scores, and the adequacy of collateral. The methodology also evaluates concentrations in the loan portfolios including loan products, year of origination, geographical distribution of collateral, and the portion of borrowers who have other client relationships with the Company. The more significant variables considered include a measure of delinquency roll rates, loss severity, housing prices, and interest rates. Delinquency roll rates (i.e., the rates at which loans transition through delinquency stages and ultimately result in a loss) are estimated from the Company’s historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information. Loss severity estimates are based on the Company’s historical loss experience and market trends. Housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values. Factors affecting the home price index include: housing inventory, unemployment, interest rates, and inflation expectations. Interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths. This quarterly analysis results in a loss factor that is applied to the outstanding balances to determine the allowance for loan loss for each loan segment. Legal Reserve: Reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, insurance coverage and indemnification, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved. The Company’s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee. Additionally, management has reviewed with the Audit Committee the Company’s significant estimates discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential for changes in revenue or the value of financial instruments held by the Company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices or market conditions. For the Company’s market risk related to interest rates, a sensitivity analysis, referred to as a net interest revenue simulation model, is shown below. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on its interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources that finance these assets. Net interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may re-price at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short and long-term interest rates. Interest-earning assets include residential real estate loans and mortgage-backed securities. These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and to changes to prepayment levels, which tend to increase in a declining rate environment. To mitigate the risk of loss, the Company has established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk, and monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interest-earning assets and funding sources. To remain within these guidelines, the Company manages the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios. Because the Company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients, the rates charged on margin loans, and controls the composition of its investment securities, it has some ability to manage its net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions. The Company is also subject to market risk as a result of fluctuations in equity prices. The Company’s direct holdings of equity securities and its associated exposure to equity prices are not material. The Company is indirectly exposed to equity market fluctuations in connection with securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers, and customer securities loaned out as part of the Company’s securities lending activities. Equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity, margin borrowing, and overall client engagement with the Company. Additionally, the Company earns mutual fund service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets. Fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue earned by the Company. Financial instruments held by the Company are also subject to liquidity risk – that is, the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument. Recent conditions in the credit markets have significantly reduced market liquidity in a wide range of financial instruments, including the types of instruments held by the Company, and fair value can differ significantly from the value implied by the credit quality and actual performance of the instrument’s underlying cash flows. Financial instruments held by the Company are also subject to valuation risk as a result of changes in valuations of the underlying collateral, such as housing prices in the case of residential real estate loans and mortgage-backed securities. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and securities available for sale, see “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Current Market and Regulatory Environment”. The Company’s market risk related to financial instruments held for trading and forward sale and interest rate lock commitments related to its loans held for sale portfolio is not material. Net Interest Revenue Simulation The Company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulation model (the model) includes all interest-sensitive assets and liabilities. Key variables in the model include the repricing of financial instruments, prepayment and reinvestment assumptions, and product pricing assumptions. The Company uses constant balances and market rates in the model assumptions in order to minimize the number of variables and to better isolate risks. The simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely - 43 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION estimate net interest revenue or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies, including changes in asset and liability mix. As represented by the simulations presented below, the Company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall (i.e., interest-earning assets generally reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities). The simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As the Company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood the Company would take steps to manage any additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment. The following table shows the results of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to the Company’s current market rates forecast on simulated net interest revenue over the next 12 months beginning December 31, 2010 and 2009. December 31, 2010 2009 Increase of 100 basis points 13.5 % 16.8 % Decrease of 100 basis points (4.8 %) (2.9 %) The sensitivities shown in the simulation reflect the fact that short-term interest rates in 2010 remained at historically low levels, including the federal funds target rate, which was unchanged at a range of zero to 0.25%. The current low interest rate environment limits the extent to which the Company can reduce interest expense paid on funding sources in a declining interest rate scenario. A decline in interest rates could therefore negatively impact the yield on the Company’s investment portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense, further compressing net interest margin. Any increases in short-term interest rates result in a greater impact as yields on interest-earning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources. - 44 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION",2023-12-30 18:56:29.667101

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Management of the Company focuses on several key financial and client activity metrics in evaluating the Company’s financial position and operating performance. Results for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 are shown in the following table: Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate1-Year2010-2011 2011 2010 2009 Client Activity Metrics: Net new client assets (1) (in billions) N/M $ 145.9 $ 26.6 $ 87.3 Client assets (in billions, at year end) 7 % $ 1,677.7 $ 1,574.5 $ 1,422.6 Clients’ daily average trades (2) (in thousands) 13 % 451.1 399.7 414.8 Company Financial Metrics: Net revenues 10 % $ 4,691 $ 4,248 $ 4,193 Expenses excluding interest (5 %) 3,299 3,469 2,917 Income before taxes on income 79 % 1,392 779 1,276 Taxes on income 62 % (528 ) (325 ) (489 ) Net income 90 % $ 864 $ 454 $ 787 Earnings per share – diluted 84 % $ .70 $ .38 $ .68 Net revenue growth (decline) from prior year 10 % 1 % (19 %) Pre-tax profit margin 29.7 % 18.3 % 30.4 % Return on stockholders’ equity 12 % 8 % 17 % Net revenue per average full-time equivalent employee (in thousands) 4 % $ 350 $ 337 $ 338 (1) Includes inflows of $56.1 billion and $7.5 billion in 2011 from a mutual fund clearing services client and the acquisition of optionsXpress, respectively.

(2) Beginning in 2010, amounts include all commission-free trades, including the Company’s Mutual Fund OneSource® funds and ETFs, and other proprietary products. Prior period amounts have been recast to reflect this change. N/M Not meaningful. • Net new client assets is defined as the total inflows of client cash and securities to the firm less client outflows. Management believes that this metric depicts how well the Company’s products and services appeal to new and existing clients in a given operating environment. • Client assets is the market value of all client assets custodied at the Company. Management considers client assets to be indicative of the Company’s appeal in the marketplace. Additionally, fluctuations in certain components of client assets (e.g., Mutual Fund OneSource funds) directly impact asset management and administration fees. • Clients’ daily average trades is an indicator of client engagement with securities markets and the most prominent driver of trading revenue. • Management believes that earnings per share, net revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin, and return on stockholders’ equity provide broad indicators of the Company’s overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns within the context of a given operating environment. • Net revenue per average full-time equivalent employee is considered by management to be the Company’s broadest measure of productivity. The Company’s major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue. The Company generates asset management and administration fees through its proprietary and third-party - 17 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) mutual fund offerings, as well as fee-based advisory solutions. Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue are impacted by securities valuations, interest rates, the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing funding sources, the Company’s ability to attract new clients, and client activity levels. The Company generates trading revenue through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenue from trading activity in fixed income securities. Trading revenue is impacted by trading volumes, the volatility of prices in the equity and fixed income markets, and commission rates. 2011 Compared to 2010 Economic and market conditions were challenging throughout 2011, marked by volatility in the equity markets, lower market valuations, and further declines in interest rates. The Standard and Poor’s 500 Index, Nasdaq Composite Index, and Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased on average 6%, 5%, and 4%, respectively, between the first and second halves of the year. The federal funds target rate remained unchanged during the year at a range of zero to 0.25% and the three-month Treasury Bill and 10-year Treasury yields declined by 11 and 141 basis points to 0.01% and 1.88%, respectively. The Company’s key client activity metrics in 2011 were stable in the midst of a weakened economic and market environment. Net new client assets totaled $145.9 billion in 2011. Core net new client assets, which exclude significant one-time flows, totaled $82.3 billion in 2011 up from $78.1 billion in 2010. Total client assets ended the year at $1.68 trillion, up 7% from 2010. In addition, clients’ daily average trades were 451,100, up 13% from 2010. Net revenues increased by 10% in 2011 from 2010 due to increases in all of the Company’s major sources of net revenues. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to an increase in revenue from the Company’s advice solutions and continued asset inflows, partially offset by money market mutual fund fee waivers, which increased to $568 million in 2011 from $433 million in 2010. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets during the year, partially offset by the effect of lower interest rate spreads resulting from higher amortization of premiums relating to residential mortgage-backed securities caused by higher mortgage prepayments in 2011. Trading revenue increased primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades and the addition of optionsXpress, which was acquired in September 2011. While total expenses excluding interest were lower by 5% in 2011 compared to 2010, the Company experienced increases in compensation and benefits, professional services, occupancy and equipment, and advertising and market development expenses in aggregate of $266 million in 2011 compared to 2010. Significant charges in 2010 included class action litigation and regulatory reserves relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund®, losses recognized for Schwab money market mutual funds, and a charge relating to the termination of the Company’s Invest First® and WorldPoints(a) Visa(b) credit card program for a total of $482 million. As a result of the Company’s ongoing investment in clients and sustained expense discipline, the Company achieved a pre-tax profit margin of 29.7% and return on stockholders’ equity of 12% in 2011. 2010 Compared to 2009 The equity markets improved during 2010 and remained well above their prior year lows. The Nasdaq Composite Index, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 17%, 13%, and 11%, respectively. The low interest rate environment continued throughout the year as the federal funds target rate remained unchanged during the year at a range of zero to 0.25%. The Company’s sustained investment in expanding and improving product and service capabilities for its clients was reflected in the strength of its key client activity metrics in 2010 – net new client assets totaled $78.1 billion, excluding (a) WorldPoints is a registered trademark of FIA Card Services, N.A.

Client trading activity slowed during the year as clients’ daily average trades decreased 4% from 2009 to 399,700. Net revenues were relatively flat in 2010 from 2009. The Company, however, experienced a change in the mix of its revenue sources as the increase in net interest revenue was offset by decreases in trading revenue, asset management and administration fees, and other revenue. Net interest revenue increased due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in the average yield earned. Trading revenue decreased due to lower average revenue per revenue trade resulting from improved online trade pricing for clients, which was implemented in January 2010, and slightly lower daily average revenue trades in 2010. While the low interest rate environment caused over $200 million of additional money market mutual fund fee waivers from the prior year, the decrease in asset management and administration fees was limited to 3% due to higher average asset valuations and continued asset inflows. Other revenue was lower in comparison to 2009 primarily due to a gain of $31 million on the repurchase of a portion of the Company’s long-term debt in 2009. Expenses excluding interest were higher by 19% in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the recognition of certain significant charges in 2010. The Company recognized class action litigation and regulatory reserves of $320 million relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund. Additionally, the Company decided to cover the net remaining losses recognized by Schwab money market mutual funds as a result of their investments in a single structured investment vehicle that defaulted in 2008 and recorded a charge of $132 million in 2010. Also, as a result of challenging credit card industry economics, the Company ended its sponsorship in its Invest First® and WorldPoints(a) Visa(b ) credit cards and recorded a charge of $30 million. The Company’s ongoing expense discipline helped limit the growth in all other expense categories in the aggregate to 3% over the prior year. Business Acquisitions On September 1, 2011, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding common shares of optionsXpress, an online brokerage firm primarily focused on equity option securities and futures, for total consideration of $714 million. Under the terms of the merger agreement, optionsXpress® stockholders received 1.02 shares of the Company’s common stock for each share of optionsXpress stock. As a result, the Company issued 59 million shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $710 million, based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on September 1, 2011. The Company also assumed optionsXpress’ stock-based compensation awards valued at $4 million. On November 9, 2010, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Windward for $106 million in common stock and $44 million in cash. Windward was an investment advisory firm that managed diversified investment portfolios comprised primarily of ETFs. For more information on the acquisitions of optionsXpress and Windward, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 3. Business Acquisitions.” Subsequent Event On January 26, 2012, the Company issued and sold 400,000 shares of fixed-to-floating rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series A, $0.01 par value, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (Series A Preferred Stock). The Series A Preferred Stock has a fixed dividend rate of 7% until 2022 and a floating rate thereafter. Net proceeds received from the sale were $394 million and are being used for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, to support the Company’s balance sheet growth and the potential migration of certain client cash balances to deposit accounts at Schwab Bank.

Further declines in interest rates continue to constrain growth in the Company’s net revenues. While the federal funds target rate was unchanged at a range of zero to 0.25% in 2011, the Federal Reserve took action during the middle of the year to lower longer term interest rates. Further declines in interest rates in 2011 have accelerated the prepayment activity in the Company’s portfolios of residential mortgage-backed securities, which resulted in higher premium amortization. To the extent rates remain at these low levels, the Company’s net interest revenue will continue to be constrained, even as growth in average balances helps to increase such revenue. The low interest rate environment also affects asset management and administration fees. The overall yields on certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds have remained at levels at or below the management fees on those funds. The Company continues to waive a portion of its management fees, which it began in the first quarter of 2009, so that the funds can continue providing a positive return to clients. These and other money market mutual funds may not be able to replace maturing securities with securities of equal or higher yields. As a result, the yields on such funds may remain around or decline from their current levels, and therefore below the management fees on those funds. To the extent this occurs, the Company may continue to waive fees and such waivers could increase from the fourth quarter 2011 level, which would negatively affect asset management and administration fees. The Company recorded net impairment charges of $31 million and $36 million related to certain non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities in 2011 and 2010, respectively, due to credit deterioration of the securities’ underlying loans. Further deterioration in the performance of the underlying loans in the Company’s residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges. The Company is pursuing lawsuits in state court in San Francisco for rescission and damages against issuers, underwriters, and dealers of 51 individual non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities on which the Company has experienced realized and unrealized losses. The lawsuits allege that offering documents for the securities contained material untrue and misleading statements about the securities and the underwriting standards and credit quality of the underlying loans. On January 27, 2012, the court denied defendants’ motions to dismiss the claims with respect to all but 4 of the 51 securities, and allowed the cases to proceed to discovery. The “Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act” was signed into law in July 2010. Among other things, the legislation authorizes various assessments and fees and requires the establishment of minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for insured depository institutions. The legislation also eliminated the Office of Thrift Supervision effective July 21, 2011 and, as a result, the Federal Reserve became CSC’s primary regulator and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency became the primary regulator of Schwab Bank. CSC is continuing to review the impact the legislation, studies and related rule-making will have on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. - 20 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion presents an analysis of the Company’s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. Net Revenues The Company’s major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue, which all increased in 2011 as compared to 2010. Asset management and administration fees and trading revenue decreased, while net interest revenue increased in 2010 as compared to 2009. $4,691 $4,691 $4,691 $4,691 $4,691 $4,691 $4,691 Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Growth Rate2010-2011 Amount % ofTotal NetRevenues Amount % ofTotal NetRevenues Amount % ofTotal NetRevenues Asset management and administration fees Schwab money market funds before fee waivers — $ 865 $ 865 $ 1,011 Fee waivers 31 % (568 ) (433 ) (224 ) Schwab money market funds after fee waivers (31 %) 297 6 % 432 10 % 787 18 % Equity and bond funds 4 % 118 3 % 114 3 % 108 3 % Mutual Fund OneSource® 12 % 680 14 % 608 14 % 446 11 % Total mutual funds 5 % 1,095 23 % 1,154 27 % 1,341 32 % Advice solutions 36 % 522 11 % 384 9 % 278 7 % Other 10 % 311 7 % 284 7 % 256 6 % Asset management and administration fees 6 % 1,928 41 % 1,822 43 % 1,875 45 % Net interest revenue Interest revenue 10 % 1,900 41 % 1,723 41 % 1,428 34 % Interest expense (12 %) (175 ) (4 %) (199 ) (5 %) (183 ) (4 %) Net interest revenue 13 % 1,725 37 % 1,524 36 % 1,245 30 % Trading revenue Commissions 12 % 866 19 % 770 18 % 884 21 % Principal transactions 2 % 61 1 % 60 2 % 112 3 % Trading revenue 12 % 927 20 % 830 20 % 996 24 % Other 19 % 160 3 % 135 3 % 175 3 % Provision for loan losses (33 %) (18 ) — (27 ) (1 %) (38 ) (1 %) Net impairment losses on securities (14 %) (31 ) (1 %) (36 ) (1 %) (60 ) (1 %) Total net revenues 10 % $ 4,691 100 % $ 4,248 100 % $ 4,193 100 % Asset Management and Administration Fees Asset management and administration fees include mutual fund service fees and fees for other asset-based financial services provided to individual and institutional clients. The Company earns mutual fund service fees for shareholder services, administration, investment management, and transfer agent services (through July 2009) provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. These fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in these funds. The Company also earns asset management fees for advice solutions, which include advisory and managed account services that are based on the daily balances of client assets subject to the specific fee for service. The fair values of client assets included in proprietary and third-party mutual funds are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data. Other asset management and administration fees include various asset based fees, such as trust fees, 401k record keeping fees, and mutual fund clearing and other service fees. Asset management and administration fees may vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees, see “Current Market and Regulatory Environment.” Asset management and administration fees increased by $106 million, or 6%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to an increase in advice solutions fees, partially offset by a decrease in mutual fund service fees. Asset management and administration fees - 21 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) decreased by $53 million, or 3%, in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to the decrease in mutual fund service fees, partially offset by an increase in advice solutions fees. Given the low interest rate environment in 2011, 2010, and 2009, the overall yields on certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds have remained at levels at or below the management fees on those funds. As a result, the Company waived a portion of its fees in order to provide a positive return to clients. Mutual fund service fees decreased by $59 million, or 5%, in 2011 from 2010 and by $187 million, or 14%, in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to the increase in money market mutual fund fee waivers, offset by higher average balances of client assets invested in the Company’s Mutual Fund OneSource funds as a result of continued asset inflows. Advice solutions fees increased by $138 million, or 36%, in 2011 from 2010 and by $106 million, or 38%, in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to higher average balances of client assets enrolled in retail advisory and managed account programs, including Schwab Private Client and Schwab Managed Portfolios™. The increase in 2011 was also attributed to the integration of Windhaven, which was acquired in November 2010. Additionally, the increases in advice solutions fees were due to temporary fees rebates of $63 million and $68 million, which reduced advice solutions fees in 2010 and 2009, respectively, under a rebate program that ended in 2010. Net Interest Revenue Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies. The Company’s investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall (i.e., interest-earning assets generally reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities). When interest rates fall, the Company may attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending the maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lock in asset yields, and by lowering rates paid to clients on interest-bearing liabilities. Since the Company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients, as well as the rates charged on receivables from brokerage clients, and also controls the composition of its investment securities, it has some ability to manage its net interest spread. The current low interest rate environment limits the extent to which the Company can reduce interest expense paid on funding sources. However, the spread is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on net interest revenue, see “Current Market and Regulatory Environment.” In clearing its clients’ trades, Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. hold cash balances payable to clients. In most cases, Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. pay their clients interest on cash balances awaiting investment, and in turn invest these funds and earn interest revenue. Receivables from brokerage clients consist primarily of margin loans to brokerage clients. Margin loans are loans made to clients on a secured basis to purchase securities. Pursuant to applicable regulations, client cash balances that are not used for margin lending are generally segregated into investment accounts that are maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients, which are recorded in cash and investments segregated on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. When investing segregated client cash balances, Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. must adhere to applicable regulations that restrict investments to securities guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, participation certificates, mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association, certificates of deposit issued by U.S. banks and thrifts, and resale agreements collateralized by qualified securities. Additionally, Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. have established policies for the minimum credit quality and maximum maturity of these investments. Schwab Bank maintains investment portfolios for liquidity as well as to invest funds from deposits in excess of loans to banking clients and liquidity limits. Schwab Bank’s securities available for sale include residential mortgage-backed securities, certificates of deposit, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, and asset-backed and other securities. Schwab Bank’s securities held to maturity include residential mortgage-backed and other securities. Schwab Bank lends funds to banking clients primarily in the form of mortgage loans and HELOCs. These loans are largely funded by interest-bearing deposits from banking clients. - 22 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The Company’s interest-earning assets are financed primarily by brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients. Noninterest-bearing funding sources include noninterest-bearing brokerage client cash balances and proceeds from stock-lending activities, as well as stockholders’equity. The following table presents net interest revenue information corresponding to interest-earning assets and funding sources on the consolidated balance sheet: Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense AverageYield/Rate AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense AverageYield/Rate AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense AverageYield/Rate Interest-earning assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 5,554 $ 13 0.23 % $ 7,269 $ 19 0.26 % $ 7,848 $ 33 0.42 % Cash and investments segregated 25,831 39 0.15 % 19,543 57 0.29 % 16,291 80 0.49 % Broker-related receivables (1) 310 — 0.05 % 317 — 0.08 % 363 1 0.28 % Receivables from brokerage clients 10,637 467 4.39 % 8,981 437 4.87 % 6,749 351 5.20 % Other securities owned (1) — — — 74 — 0.45 % 126 1 0.79 % Securities available for sale (2) 27,486 456 1.66 % 24,209 486 2.01 % 18,558 521 2.81 % Securities held to maturity 16,050 492 3.07 % 10,440 361 3.46 % 1,915 74 3.86 % Loans to banking clients 9,472 310 3.27 % 7,987 275 3.44 % 6,671 241 3.61 % Loans held for sale 65 3 4.62 % 80 4 5.00 % 110 5 4.55 % Total interest-earning assets 95,405 1,780 1.87 % 78,900 1,639 2.08 % 58,631 1,307 2.23 % Other interest revenue 120 84 121 Total interest-earning assets $ 95,405 $ 1,900 1.99 % $ 78,900 $ 1,723 2.18 % $ 58,631 $ 1,428 2.44 % Funding sources: Deposits from banking clients $ 52,701 $ 62 0.12 % $ 44,858 $ 105 0.23 % $ 31,249 $ 107 0.34 % Payables to brokerage clients 29,992 3 0.01 % 22,715 2 0.01 % 18,002 3 0.02 % Long-term debt 2,004 108 5.39 % 1,648 92 5.58 % 1,231 71 5.77 % Total interest-bearing liabilities 84,697 173 0.20 % 69,221 199 0.29 % 50,482 181 0.36 % Noninterest-bearing funding sources 10,708 9,679 8,149 Other interest expense 2 — 2 Total funding sources $ 95,405 $ 175 0.18 % $ 78,900 $ 199 0.25 % $ 58,631 $ 183 0.32 % Net interest revenue $ 1,725 1.81 % $ 1,524 1.93 % $ 1,245 2.12 % (1) Interest revenue was less than $500,000 in the period or periods presented. (2) Amounts have been calculated based on amortized cost. Net interest revenue increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the effect of lower interest rate spreads resulting from higher amortization of premiums relating to residential mortgage-backed securities. The growth in average balances of deposits from banking clients and payables to brokerage clients funded the increases in the balances of receivables from brokerage clients, securities available for sale, and securities held to maturity. Further declines in interest rates in 2011 accelerated the prepayment activity in the Company’s portfolio of residential mortgage-backed securities, which resulted in higher premium amortization. Net interest revenue increased in 2010 from 2009 due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets. This resulted from significant growth in the average balance of deposits from banking clients, which in turn funded increases in the average balances of securities held to maturity, securities available for sale, and loans to banking clients. These interest-earning assets are invested at rates above the cost of supporting funding sources. The increase in net interest revenue was partially offset by the decline in the yields of almost all interest-earning assets compared to 2009. Trading Revenue Trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenue is affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. Principal transaction revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from client fixed income securities trading activity. Factors that influence principal transaction revenue include the volume of client trades and market price volatility. Trading revenue increased by $97 million, or 12%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades and the addition of optionsXpress. Trading revenue decreased by $166 million, or 17%, in 2010 from 2009 due to lower - 23 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) average revenue per revenue trade resulting from improved online trade pricing for clients and lower daily average revenue trades. As shown in the following table, daily average revenue trades increased by 12% in 2011. The increase was primarily due to a higher volume of option, equity, and mutual fund trades. Average revenue per revenue trade remained relatively flat in 2011. Daily average revenue trades decreased 5% in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to a lower volume of equity and principal transaction trades, partially offset by a higher volume of option trades. Average revenue per revenue trade decreased 11% in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to lower online equity trade commissions, which were implemented in January 2010.

Other Revenue Other revenue includes software fee revenue relating to the Company’s portfolio management services, exchange processing fee revenue, gains on sales of mortgage loans, and other service fee revenues. Other revenue increased by $25 million, or 19%, in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increases in software and exchange processing fee revenues, as well as the addition of education services revenue from the acquisition of optionsXpress. Other revenue was lower by $40 million, or 23%, in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a gain of $31 million on the repurchase of a portion of the Company’s long-term debt in 2009. Provision for Loan Losses The provision for loan losses decreased by $9 million, or 33%, in 2011 from 2010, due to a decrease in overall expected loss rates resulting primarily from a decrease in first mortgage loan delinquencies. The provision for loan losses decreased by $11 million, or 29%, in 2010 from 2009, primarily due to stabilization in the levels of loan delinquencies and nonaccrual loans in 2010 compared to 2009. Charge-offs were $19 million, $20 million, and $13 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. For further discussion on the Company’s credit risk and the allowance for loan losses, see “Risk Management – Credit Risk” and “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 7. Loans to Banking Clients and Related Allowance for Loan Losses.” Net Impairment Losses on Securities Net impairment losses on securities were $31 million, $36 million, and $60 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. These charges relate to certain non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities in the Company’s available for sale portfolio as a result of credit deterioration of the securities’ underlying loans. For further discussion, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 6. Securities Available for Sale and Securities Held to Maturity.” - 24 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Expenses Excluding Interest As shown in the table below, expenses excluding interest were lower in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to certain significant charges in 2010, including class action litigation and regulatory reserves relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund and losses recognized for Schwab money market mutual funds. The decrease in expenses excluding interest caused by these charges in 2010 was offset by increases in compensation and benefits, professional services, occupancy and equipment, and advertising and market development expenses in 2011. Expenses excluding interest were higher in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the charges previously discussed.

Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits expense includes salaries and wages, incentive compensation, and related employee benefits and taxes. Incentive compensation includes variable compensation, discretionary bonus costs, and stock-based compensation. Variable compensation includes payments to certain individuals based on their sales performance. Discretionary bonus costs are based on the Company’s overall performance as measured by earnings per share, and therefore will fluctuate with this measure. In 2009, discretionary bonus costs were based on the achievement of specified performance objectives, including revenue growth and pre-tax profit margin. Stock-based compensation primarily includes employee and board of director stock options, restricted stock awards, and restricted stock units. - 25 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Compensation and benefits expense increased by $159 million, or 10%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to increases in salaries and wages and incentive compensation. Compensation and benefits expense increased by $29 million, or 2%, in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation. The following table shows a comparison of certain compensation and benefits components and employee data: Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate2010-2011 2011 2010 2009 Salaries and wages 9 % $ 1,012 $ 931 $ 930 Incentive compensation 15 % 444 386 355 Employee benefits and other 8 % 276 256 259 Total compensation and benefits expense 10 % $ 1,732 $ 1,573 $ 1,544 Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total net revenues: Salaries and wages 22 % 22 % 22 % Incentive compensation 9 % 9 % 8 % Employee benefits and other 6 % 6 % 7 % Total compensation and benefits expense 37 % 37 % 37 % Full-time equivalent employees (in thousands) (1) At year end 10 % 14.1 12.8 12.4 Average 6 % 13.4 12.6 12.4 (1) Includes full-time, part-time and temporary employees, and persons employed on a contract basis, and excludes employees of outsourced service providers. Salaries and wages increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to increases in full-time employees and persons employed on a contract basis. The increase in full-time employees was partially due to the addition of full-time employees from the optionsXpress acquisition in September 2011. Incentive compensation increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to an increase in discretionary bonus costs and higher variable compensation. Discretionary bonus costs increased based on the Company’s overall performance in 2011, as well as an increase in full time employees. Variable compensation was higher primarily due to the integration of Windhaven, which was acquired in November 2010. Employee benefits and other expense increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to increases in payroll taxes and the Company’s 401(k) plan contribution expense as a result of increases in incentive compensation and full-time employees. Salaries and wages were relatively flat in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to increases in persons employed on a contract basis and full-time employees, offset by severance expense of $58 million in 2009 relating to the Company’s cost reduction measures. Incentive compensation increased in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to higher variable compensation resulting from product sales performance in the Company’s branch offices and higher stock-based compensation relating to the amortization of its stock options and restricted stock units. Expenses Excluding Compensation and Benefits Professional services expense increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to an increase in fees relating to the Company’s technology investments and client facing infrastructure, and approximately $10 million in costs relating to the integration of optionsXpress. Professional services expense increased in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to increases in fees relating to technology services and enhancements, and investment advisor fees relating to the Company’s managed account service programs. Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to an increase in the Company’s investments in data processing equipment. Occupancy and equipment expense decreased in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to facilities charges of $43 million in 2009 relating to the Company’s cost reduction measures. Advertising and market development expense increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to higher spending on customer and branch promotions and electronic media. - 26 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Communications expense increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to higher telephone service expense and third-party news and information expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to higher amortization of intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of optionsXpress and Windhaven. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. In 2011 and 2010, the Company recorded class action litigation and regulatory reserves relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund. For further discussion of the Schwab YieldPlus Fund litigation and regulatory matters, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 15. Commitments and Contingencies.” In 2010, the Company decided to cover the net remaining losses of $132 million recognized by Schwab money market mutual funds as a result of their investments in a single structured investment vehicle that defaulted in 2008. Other expense was lower in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a charge of $30 million in 2010, relating to the Company’s Invest First and WorldPoints Visa credit cards, as the Company ended its sponsorship due to challenging credit card industry economics. Other expense was higher in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to this charge and an increase in employee travel expenses. Taxes on Income The Company’s effective income tax rate on income before taxes was 37.9% in 2011, 41.7% in 2010, and 38.3% in 2009. The decrease in 2011 from 2010 was due to a lower effective state income tax rate in 2011 and the impact of non-deductible penalties relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund regulatory settlements recorded in 2010. The increase in 2010 from 2009 was primarily due to the impact of non-deductible penalties in 2010. Segment Information The Company provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments – Investor Services and Institutional Services. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services to individual investors. The Institutional Services segment provides custodial, trading, and support services to independent investment advisors. The Institutional Services segment also provides retirement plan services, specialty brokerage services, and mutual fund clearing services, and supports the availability of Schwab proprietary mutual funds and collective trust funds on third-party platforms. Banking revenues and expenses are allocated to the Company’s two segments based on which segment services the client. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments on a pre-tax basis, excluding items such as impairment charges on non-financial assets, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and significant restructuring and other charges. Segment assets and liabilities are not disclosed because the balances are not used for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments. - 27 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Financial information for the Company’s reportable segments is presented in the following tables: Investor Services Institutional Services Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate2010-2011 2011 2010 2009 Growth Rate2010-2011 2011 2010 2009 Net Revenues Asset management andadministration fees 8 % $ 1,053 $ 976 $ 968 3 % $ 875 $ 846 $ 907 Net interest revenue 13 % 1,468 1,297 1,058 13 % 257 227 187 Trading revenue 12 % 625 557 679 11 % 302 273 317 Other 21 % 85 70 93 15 % 75 65 82 Provision for loan losses (35 %) (15 ) (23 ) (34 ) (25 %) (3 ) (4 ) (4 ) Net impairment losses on securities (16 %) (27 ) (32 ) (54 ) — (4 ) (4 ) (6 ) Total net revenues 12 % 3,189 2,845 2,710 7 % 1,502 1,403 1,483 Expenses Excluding Interest 9 % 2,261 2,065 1,906 8 % 1,039 960 929 Income before taxes on income 19 % $ 928 $ 780 $ 804 5 % $ 463 $ 443 $ 554 Unallocated Total Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate2010-2011 2011 2010 2009 Growth Rate2010-2011 2011 2010 2009 Net Revenues Asset management andadministration fees — $ — $ — $ — 6 % $ 1,928 $ 1,822 $ 1,875 Net interest revenue — — — — 13 % 1,725 1,524 1,245 Trading revenue — — — — 12 % 927 830 996 Other — — — — 19 % 160 135 175 Provision for loan losses — — — — (33 %) (18 ) (27 ) (38 ) Net impairment losseson securities — — — — (14 %) (31 ) (36 ) (60 ) Total net revenues — — — — 10 % 4,691 4,248 4,193 Expenses Excluding Interest N/M (1 ) 444 82 (5 %) 3,299 3,469 2,917 Income before taxes on income N/M $ 1 $ (444 ) $ (82 ) 79 % $ 1,392 $ 779 $ 1,276 Taxes on income 62 % (528 ) (325 ) (489 ) Net Income 90 % $ 864 $ 454 $ 787 N/M Not meaningful. Investor Services Net revenues increased by $344 million, or 12%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue, asset management and administration fees, and trading revenue. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets during the year, partially offset by the effect of higher premium amortization relating to residential mortgage-backed securities caused by higher mortgage prepayments in 2011. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to an increase in revenue from the Company’s advice solutions and continued asset inflows, offset by money market mutual fund fee waivers. Trading revenue increased primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades and the addition of optionsXpress, which was acquired in September 2011. Expenses excluding interest increased by $196 million, or 9%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits, professional services, and advertising and market development expenses, which included the integration of optionsXpress. - 28 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Net revenues increased by $135 million, or 5%, in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to an increase in net interest revenue and lower net impairment losses on securities, partially offset by decreases in trading revenue and other revenue. Net interest revenue increased due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in the average yield earned. Trading revenue decreased due to lower average revenue per revenue trade resulting from improved online trade pricing for clients, which was implemented in January 2010, and slightly lower daily average revenue trades in 2010. Other revenue was lower in comparison to 2009 due to a gain on the repurchase of a portion of the Company’s long-term debt in 2009. While the low interest rate environment caused additional money market mutual fund fee waivers from 2009, asset management and administration fees were relatively flat due to higher average asset valuations and continued asset inflows. Expenses excluding interest increased by $159 million, or 8%, in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits, professional services, and other expenses. Other expense includes a charge relating to the Company’s termination of its sponsorship in its Invest First and WorldPoints Visa credit cards in 2010 as a result of challenging credit card economics. Institutional Services Net revenues increased by $99 million, or 7%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue, asset management and administration fees, and trading revenue. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets during the year, partially offset by the effect of higher premium amortization relating to residential mortgage-backed securities caused by higher mortgage prepayments in 2011. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to an increase in mutual fund service fees relating to the Company’s Mutual Fund OneSource funds as a result of continued asset inflows, offset by money market mutual fund fee waivers. Trading revenue increased primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades. Expenses excluding interest increased by $79 million, or 8%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits and professional services expenses. Net revenues decreased by $80 million, or 5%, in 2010 from 2009 due to decreases in asset management and administration fees, trading revenue, and other revenue, offset by an increase in net interest revenue. Asset management and administration fees decreased primarily due to money market mutual fund fee waivers, partially offset by the effect of higher average asset valuations and continued asset inflows. Additionally, in August 2010 management transferred client assets associated with the Schwab Advisor Network to the Investor Services segment and started recording the related asset management and administration fee revenue to that segment. Trading revenue decreased due to lower average revenue per revenue trade resulting from improved online trade pricing for clients, which was implemented in January 2010, and slightly lower daily average revenue trades in 2010. Other revenue was lower in comparison to 2009 due to a gain on the repurchase of a portion of the Company’s long-term debt in 2009. Net interest revenue increased due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in the average yield earned. Expenses excluding interest increased by $31 million, or 3%, in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense. Unallocated Expenses excluding interest in 2010 include class action litigation and regulatory reserves relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund and a charge relating to the Company’s decision to cover the net remaining losses recognized by Schwab money market mutual funds as a result of their investments in a single structured investment vehicle that defaulted in 2008. Expenses excluding interest in 2009 include facilities and severance charges relating to the Company’s cost reduction measures. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CSC conducts substantially all of its business through its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company’s capital structure is designed to provide each subsidiary with capital and liquidity to meet its operational needs and regulatory requirements. CSC is a savings and loan holding company and Schwab Bank, CSC’s depository institution, is a federal savings bank. Prior to July 21, 2011, CSC and Schwab Bank were both subject to supervision and regulation by the OTS. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the OTS effective July 21, 2011, and as a result, the Federal Reserve became CSC’s primary regulator and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency became the primary regulator of Schwab Bank. - 29 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Liquidity CSC While CSC is not currently subject to specific statutory capital requirements, CSC is required to serve as a source of strength for Schwab Bank and must have the ability to provide financial assistance if Schwab Bank experiences financial distress. To manage capital adequacy, the Company currently utilizes a target Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, of at least 6%. At December 31, 2011, the Company’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 6.3%. CSC’s liquidity needs are generally met through cash generated by its subsidiaries, as well as cash provided by external financing. CSC has a universal automatic shelf registration statement (Shelf Registration Statement) on file with the SEC which enables CSC to issue debt, equity and other securities. CSC maintains excess liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments to cover daily funding needs and to support growth in the Company’s business. Generally, CSC does not hold liquidity at its subsidiaries in excess of amounts deemed sufficient to support the subsidiaries’ operations, including any regulatory capital requirements. Schwab, Schwab Bank, and optionsXpress, Inc. are subject to regulatory requirements that may restrict them from certain transactions with CSC, as further discussed below. Management believes that funds generated by the operations of CSC’s subsidiaries will continue to be the primary funding source in meeting CSC’s liquidity needs, providing adequate liquidity to meet Schwab Bank’s capital guidelines, and maintaining Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc.’s net capital. In January 2012, the Company completed an equity offering of 400,000 shares of its preferred stock under the Shelf Registration Statement. For further discussion of the equity offering, see “Subsequent Event”. CSC has liquidity needs that arise from the funding of cash dividends, acquisitions, and investments, as well as its Senior Notes, Senior Medium-Term Notes, Series A (Medium-Term Notes), and Junior Subordinated Notes. The following are details of CSC’s long-term debt: December 31, 2011 ParOutstanding Maturity Interest Rate Moody’s Standard& Poor’s Fitch Senior Notes $ 1,450 2014 – 2020 4.45% to 4.950% fixed A2 A A Medium Term Notes $ 250 2017 6.375% fixed A2 A A Junior Subordinated Notes (1) $ 202 2067 7.50% fixed until 2017, Baa1 BBB+ BBB+ floating thereafter (1) The Junior Subordinated Notes themselves are not rated, however, the trust preferred securities related to these Junior Subordinated Notes are rated. CSC has authorization from its Board of Directors to issue unsecured commercial paper notes (Commercial Paper Notes) not to exceed $1.5 billion. Management has set a current limit for the commercial paper program of $800 million. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes may vary, but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper is not redeemable prior to maturity and cannot be voluntarily prepaid. The proceeds of the commercial paper program are to be used for general corporate purposes. There were no borrowings of Commercial Paper Notes outstanding at December 31, 2011. CSC’s ratings for these short-term borrowings are P1 by Moody’s, A1 by Standard & Poor’s, and F1 by Fitch. CSC maintains an $800 million committed, unsecured credit facility with a group of 11 banks, which is scheduled to expire in June 2012. This facility replaced a similar facility that expired in June 2011 and was unused in 2011. The funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes, including repayment of the Commercial Paper Notes discussed above. The financial covenants under this facility require Schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, as defined, Schwab Bank to be well capitalized, as defined, and CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity. At December 31, 2011, the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was $5.0 billion (CSC’s stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2011 was $7.7 billion). Management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on CSC’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements. - 30 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) CSC also has direct access to $750 million of the $875 million uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines discussed below, that are primarily utilized by Schwab to manage short-term liquidity. These lines were not used by CSC during 2011. In addition, Schwab provides CSC with a $1.0 billion credit facility maturing in December 2014. This facility replaced a similar facility that expired in December 2011. There were no funds drawn under this facility at December 31, 2011. Schwab Schwab is subject to regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit Schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings from CSC, paying cash dividends, or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000. At December 31, 2011, Schwab’s net capital was $1.2 billion (10% of aggregate debit balances), which was $948 million in excess of its minimum required net capital and $588 million in excess of 5% of aggregate debit balances. Most of Schwab’s assets are readily convertible to cash, consisting primarily of short-term (i.e., less than 150 days) investment-grade, interest-earning investments (the majority of which are segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients pursuant to regulatory requirements), receivables from brokerage clients, and receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations. Client margin loans are demand loan obligations secured by readily marketable securities. Receivables from and payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations primarily represent current open transactions, which usually settle, or can be closed out, within a few business days. Liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts, which were $33.5 billion and $29.9 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for Schwab. Schwab has a finance lease obligation related to an office building and land under a 20-year lease. The remaining finance lease obligation of $100 million at December 31, 2011, is being reduced by a portion of the lease payments over the remaining lease term of 13 years. To manage short-term liquidity, Schwab maintains uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines with a group of six banks totaling $875 million at December 31, 2011. The need for short-term borrowings arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest-earnings investments, and movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements. Schwab borrowed an average of $41 million per day for nine days in 2011 under these lines. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2011. To partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), Schwab has unsecured standby letter of credit agreements (LOCs) with eight banks in favor of the OCC aggregating $350 million at December 31, 2011. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. Schwab satisfies the collateral requirements by arranging LOCs, in favor of these brokerage clients, which are issued by multiple banks. At December 31, 2011, the aggregate face amount of these LOCs totaled $78 million. There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs during 2011. To manage Schwab’s regulatory capital requirement, CSC provides Schwab with a $1.4 billion subordinated revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in March 2012. The amount outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2011, was $245 million. Borrowings under this subordinated lending arrangement qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab. In addition, CSC provides Schwab with a $2.5 billion credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in December 2014. This facility replaced a similar facility that expired in December 2011. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab. There were no funds drawn under this facility at December 31, 2011. - 31 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Schwab Bank Schwab Bank is required to maintain capital levels as specified in federal banking laws and regulations. Failure to meet the minimum levels could result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on Schwab Bank. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2011, Schwab Bank is considered well capitalized. Schwab Bank’s regulatory capital and ratios at December 31, 2011, are as follows: Actual Minimum CapitalRequirement Minimum to beWell Capitalized Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital $ 4,984 23.4 % $ 850 4.0 % $ 1,276 6.0 % Total Risk-Based Capital $ 5,036 23.7 % $ 1,701 8.0 % $ 2,126 10.0 % Tier 1 Core Capital $ 4,984 7.5 % $ 2,642 4.0 % $ 3,302 5.0 % Tangible Equity $ 4,984 7.5 % $ 1,321 2.0 % N/A N/A Not applicable. Management has established a target Tier 1 Core Capital Ratio for Schwab Bank of at least 7.5%. Schwab Bank’s current liquidity needs are generally met through deposits from banking clients and equity capital. The excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts is swept into deposit accounts at Schwab Bank. At December 31, 2011, these balances totaled $40.6 billion. Schwab Bank has access to traditional funding sources such as deposits, federal funds purchased, and repurchase agreements. Additionally, Schwab Bank has access to short-term funding through the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) discount window. Amounts available under the FRB discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain of Schwab Bank’s securities available for sale and securities held to maturity that are pledged as collateral. Schwab Bank maintains policies and procedures necessary to access this funding and tests discount window borrowing procedures annually. At December 31, 2011, $1.2 billion was available under this arrangement. There were no funds drawn under this arrangement during 2011. Schwab Bank maintains a credit facility with the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Amounts available under this facility are dependent on the amount of Schwab Bank’s residential real estate mortgages and HELOCs that are pledged as collateral. At December 31, 2011, $5.2 billion was available under this facility. There were no funds drawn under this facility during 2011. CSC provides Schwab Bank with a $100 million short-term credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in December 2014. This facility replaced a similar facility that expired in December 2011. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab Bank. There were no funds drawn under these facilities during 2011. optionsXpress optionsXpress, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of optionsXpress, is a registered broker-dealer and is subject to regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit optionsXpress, Inc. from paying cash dividends or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000. At December 31, 2011, optionsXpress Inc.’s net capital was $78 million (29% of aggregate debit balances), which was $73 million in excess of its minimum required net capital and $65 million in excess of 5% of aggregate debit balances. optionsXpress, Inc. is also subject to Commodity Futures Trading Commission Regulation 1.17 (Reg. 1.17) under the Commodity Exchange Act, which also requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. optionsXpress, Inc. as a futures commission merchant, is required to maintain minimum net capital equal to the greater of its net capital requirement under - 32 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Reg. 1.17 ($1 million), or the sum of 8% of the total risk margin requirements for all positions carried in customer accounts and 8% of the total risk margin requirements for all positions carried in non-customer accounts (as defined in Reg. 1.17). Liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts, which were $1.2 billion at December 31, 2011. Management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for optionsXpress, Inc. CSC provides optionsXpress, Inc. with a $100 million credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in December 2014. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for optionsXpress, Inc. There were no funds drawn under this facility since the acquisition date. optionsXpress has a term loan with CSC, of which $118 million was outstanding at December 31, 2011, and matures in December 2014. Capital Resources The Company monitors both the relative composition and absolute level of its capital structure. Management is focused on limiting the Company’s use of capital and currently targets a long-term debt to total financial capital ratio not to exceed 30%. The Company’s total financial capital (long-term debt plus stockholders’ equity) at December 31, 2011, was $9.7 billion, up $1.5 billion, or 18%, from December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, the Company had long-term debt of $2.0 billion, or 21% of total financial capital, that bears interest at a weighted-average rate of 5.24%. At December 31, 2010, the Company had long-term debt of $2.0 billion, or 24% of total financial capital. The Company repaid $116 million of long-term debt in 2011, which included the pay off of long-term debt acquired from optionsXpress of $110 million subsequent to the acquisition date. In 2010, the Company issued $700 million of additional Senior Notes that mature in 2020 and have a fixed interest rate of 4.45%. The Company repaid $205 million of long-term debt in 2010, which included the maturity of $200 million of Medium-Term Notes. The Company’s cash position (reported as cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated balance sheet) and cash flows are affected by changes in brokerage client cash balances and the associated amounts required to be segregated under regulatory guidelines. Timing differences between cash and investments actually segregated on a given date and the amount required to be segregated for that date may arise in the ordinary course of business and are addressed by the Company in accordance with applicable regulations. Other factors which affect the Company’s cash position and cash flows include investment activity in securities, levels of capital expenditures, acquisition and divestiture activity, banking client deposit activity, brokerage and banking client loan activity, financing activity in long-term debt, payments of dividends, and repurchases and issuances of CSC’s preferred and common stock. The combination of these factors can cause significant fluctuations in the cash position during specific time periods. Capital Expenditures The Company’s capital expenditures were $190 million (4% of net revenues) and $127 million (3% of net revenues) in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2011 and 2010 were primarily for software and equipment relating to the Company’s information technology systems, capitalized costs for developing internal-use software, and leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs for developing internal-use software were $57 million and $21 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Management currently anticipates that 2012 capital expenditures will be approximately 30% lower than 2011 spending primarily due to decreased spending on software and equipment relating to the Company’s information technology systems, capitalized costs for developing internal-use software, and leasehold improvements. As has been the case in recent years, the Company may adjust its capital expenditures periodically as business conditions change. Management believes that funds generated by its operations will continue to be the primary funding source of its capital expenditures. - 33 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Equity Offering On January 26, 2010, the Company sold 29,670,300 shares of its common stock, $.01 par value, at a public offering price of $19.00 per share. Net proceeds received from the offering were $543 million and were used to support the Company’s balance sheet growth, including expansion of its deposit base and migration of certain client balances from money market funds into deposit accounts at Schwab Bank. Dividends CSC paid common stock cash dividends of $295 million ($0.24 per share) and $288 million ($0.24 per share) in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Since the initial dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 91 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend rate 19 times, including a 20% increase in the third quarter of 2008. Since 1989, dividends have increased by a 24% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, the Company currently targets its cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income. Under the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock issued in January 2012, the Company’s ability to pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or to repurchase, redeem or acquire its common stock is subject to restrictions in the event that the Company does not declare and either pay or set aside a sum sufficient for payment of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock for the immediately preceding dividend period. Share Repurchases There were no repurchases of CSC’s common stock in 2011 or 2010. As of December 31, 2011, CSC had remaining authority from the Board of Directors to repurchase up to $596 million of its common stock, which does not have an expiration date. Business Acquisitions On September 1, 2011, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding common shares of optionsXpress, an online brokerage firm primarily focused on equity option securities and futures, for total consideration of $714 million. Under the terms of the merger agreement, optionsXpress stockholders received 1.02 shares of the Company’s common stock for each share of optionsXpress stock. As a result, the Company issued 59 million shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $710 million, based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on September 1, 2011. The Company also assumed optionsXpress’ stock-based compensation awards valued at $4 million. On November 9, 2010, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Windward for $106 million in common stock and $44 million in cash. For more information on the acquisitions of optionsXpress and Windward, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 3. Business Acquisitions”. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of its clients. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, the Company enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For information on each of these arrangements, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 15. Commitments and Contingencies.” - 34 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Contractual Obligations The Company’s principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011, are shown in the following table. Management believes that funds generated by its continuing operations, as well as cash provided by external financing, will continue to be the primary funding sources in meeting these obligations. Excluded from this table are liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet that are generally short-term in nature (e.g., payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations) or without contractual payment terms (e.g., deposits from banking clients, payables to brokerage clients, and deferred compensation).

RISK MANAGEMENT Overview The Company’s business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including technology, operations, credit, market, liquidity, legal, and reputational risk. Identification and management of these risks are essential to the success and financial soundness of the Company. Senior management takes an active role in the Company’s risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling various risks. Oversight of risk management has been delegated to the Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior managers of major business and control functions. The Global Risk Committee is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the Company’s risk exposures and leading the continued development of the Company’s risk management policies and practices. Functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report into the Global Risk Committee. These sub-committees include the: • Corporate Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee, which focuses on the Company’s liquidity, capital resources, interest rate risk, and investments; • Credit and Market Risk Oversight Committee, which focuses on credit exposures resulting from client borrowing activity (e.g., margin lending activities and loans to banking clients), investing activities of certain of the Company’s proprietary funds, corporate credit and investment activity, and market risk resulting from the Company taking positions in certain securities to facilitate client trading activity; - 35 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) • Information Security and Privacy Steering Committee, which oversees information security and privacy policies, procedures and controls; • Investment Management and ERISA Risk Committee, which oversees activities in which the Company and its principals operate in an investment advisory capacity or as an ERISA fiduciary; • Investment Products Review Board, which provides senior level oversight of investment products and services made available to clients; and • Operational Risk Management Committee, which focuses on risks relating to potential inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, and from external events and relationships (e.g., vendors and business partners). The Global Risk Committee reports regularly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Audit Committee), which reviews major risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The Company’s Disclosure Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s (a) disclosure controls and procedures and (b) internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The Company’s compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and corporate risk management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring the Company’s risk management. Risk is inherent in the Company’s business. Consequently, despite the Company’s efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer unexpected losses due to operating or other risks. The following discussion highlights the Company’s policies and procedures for identification, assessment, and management of the principal areas of risk in its operations. Technology and Operating Risk Technology and operating risk is the potential for loss due to deficiencies in control processes or technology systems that constrain the Company’s ability to gather, process, and communicate information and process client transactions efficiently and securely, without interruptions. The Company’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and the Company’s success depends, in part, on its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its technology in anticipation of evolving client needs. To the extent the Company experiences system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to its systems, linkages with third-party systems, and power failures), the Company’s business and operations could be significantly negatively impacted. To minimize business interruptions, Schwab has two data centers intended, in part, to further improve the recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency. The Company is committed to an ongoing process of upgrading, enhancing, and testing its technology systems. This effort is focused on meeting client needs, meeting market and regulatory changes, and deploying standardized technology platforms. Technology and operating risk also includes the risk of human error, employee misconduct, external fraud, computer viruses, distributed denial of service attacks, terrorist attacks, and natural disaster. Employee misconduct could include fraud and misappropriation of client or Company assets, improper use or disclosure of confidential client or Company information, and unauthorized activities, such as transactions exceeding acceptable risks or authorized limits. External fraud includes misappropriation of client or Company assets by third parties, including through unauthorized access to Company systems and data and client accounts. The frequency and sophistication of such fraud attempts continue to increase. The Company has specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and uses periodic risk self-assessments and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The Company maintains backup and recovery functions, including facilities for backup and communications, and conducts periodic testing of disaster recovery plans. The Company also maintains policies and procedures and technology to protect against fraud and unauthorized access to systems and data. - 36 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Despite the Company’s risk management efforts, it is not always possible to deter or prevent technological or operational failure, or fraud or other misconduct, and the precautions taken by the Company may not be effective in all cases. The Company may be subject to litigation, losses, and regulatory actions in such cases, and may be required to expend significant additional resources to remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures. The Company also faces technology and operating risk when it employs the services of various external vendors, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. The Company manages its exposure to external vendor risk through contractual provisions, control standards, and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance. The Company maintains policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with Company data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-public client information. The Company clearly defines for employees, contractors, and vendors the Company’s expected standards of care for confidential data. Regular training is provided by the Company in regard to data security. The Company is actively engaged in the research and development of new technologies, services, and products. The Company endeavors to protect its research and development efforts, and its brands, through the use of copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and contracts. Credit Risk Credit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations. The Company’s direct exposure to credit risk mainly results from margin lending activities, securities lending activities, mortgage lending activities, its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities. To manage the risks of such losses, the Company has established policies and procedures which include: establishing and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin requirements for certain securities. Most of the Company’s credit extensions are supported by collateral arrangements. Collateral arrangements relating to margin loans, securities lending agreements, and resale agreements include provisions that require additional collateral in the event that market fluctuations result in declines in the value of collateral received. The Company’s credit risk exposure related to loans to banking clients is actively managed through individual and portfolio reviews performed by management. Management regularly reviews asset quality including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for loan losses, which is reviewed quarterly by senior management. The Company’s mortgage loan portfolios primarily include first lien residential real estate mortgage loans (First Mortgage) of $5.6 billion and HELOCs of $3.5 billion at December 31, 2011. The Company’s First Mortgage portfolio underwriting requirements are generally consistent with the underwriting requirements in the secondary market for loan portfolios. The Company’s guidelines include maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Issac & Company (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan is conforming or jumbo). These credit underwriting standards have limited the exposure to the types of loans that experienced high foreclosures and loss rates elsewhere in the industry in recent years. There have been no significant changes to the LTV ratio or FICO credit score guidelines related to the Company’s First Mortgage or HELOC portfolios during 2011. At December 31, 2011, the weighted-average originated LTV ratios were 60% and 59% for the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, respectively. The computation of the origination LTV ratio for a HELOC includes any first lien mortgage outstanding on the same property at the time of origination. At December 31, 2011, 22% of HELOCs ($755 million of the HELOC portfolio) were in a first lien position. The weighted-average originated FICO credit scores were 766 and 768 for the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, respectively. The Company does not offer loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO credit score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. At December 31, 2011, approximately 1% of both the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios consisted of loans to borrowers with FICO credit scores of less than 620. - 37 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The following table presents certain of the Company’s loan quality metrics as a percentage of total outstanding loans: December 31, 2011 2010 Loan delinquencies (1) 0.81 % 0.96 % Nonaccrual loans 0.53 % 0.58 % Allowance for loan losses 0.55 % 0.60 % (1) Loan delinquencies are defined as loans that are 30 days or more past due. The Company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale and securities held to maturity portfolios, whose fair values totaled $34.0 billion and $15.5 billion at December 31, 2011, respectively. These portfolios include U.S. agency and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, certificates of deposit, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, and asset-backed and other securities. U.S. agency residential mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings, however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. Included in non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities are securities collateralized by loans that are considered to be “Prime” (defined by the Company as loans to borrowers with a FICO credit score of 620 or higher at origination), and “Alt-A” (defined by the Company as Prime loans with reduced documentation at origination). Residential mortgage-backed securities, particularly Alt-A securities experienced continued credit deterioration in 2011, including increased payment delinquency rates and losses on foreclosures of underlying mortgages. For a discussion of the impact of current market conditions on residential mortgage-backed securities, see “Current Market and Regulatory Environment.” At December 31, 2011, non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities consisted of 3%, based on amortized cost, of total residential mortgage-backed securities. These securities were originated between 2003 and 2007. At December 31, 2011, all of the corporate debt securities and non-mortgage asset-backed securities were rated investment grade (defined as a rating equivalent to a Moody’s rating of “Baa” or higher, or a Standard & Poor’s rating of “BBB-” or higher). Schwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab’s client or a counterparty fails to meet its obligations to Schwab. The Company sponsors a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds. Although the Company has no obligation to do so, the Company may decide for competitive reasons to provide credit, liquidity or other support to its funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity. Such support could cause the Company to take significant charges and could reduce the Company’s liquidity. If the Company chose not to provide credit, liquidity or other support in such a situation, the Company could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected. Concentration Risk The Company has exposure to concentration risk when holding large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry. The fair value of the Company’s investments in residential mortgage-backed securities totaled $37.0 billion at December 31, 2011. Of these, $36.1 billion were U.S. agency securities and $907 million were non-agency securities. The U.S. agency securities are included in securities available for sale and securities held to maturity and the non-agency securities are included in securities available for sale. Included in non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities are securities collateralized by Alt-A loans. At December 31, 2011, the amortized cost and fair value of Alt-A mortgage-backed securities were $390 million and $279 million, respectively. - 38 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The Company’s investments in corporate debt securities and commercial paper totaled $5.6 billion at December 31, 2011, with the majority issued by institutions in the financial services industry. These securities are included in securities available for sale, securities held to maturity, cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes, cash and cash equivalents, and other securities owned in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2011, the Company held $867 million of corporate debt securities issued by financial institutions and guaranteed under the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. The Company’s loans to banking clients include $5.6 billion of adjustable rate first lien residential real estate mortgage loans at December 31, 2011. The Company’s adjustable rate mortgages have initial fixed interest rates for three to ten years and interest rates that adjust annually thereafter. Approximately 60% of these mortgages consisted of loans with interest-only payment terms. The interest rates on approximately 65% of these interest-only loans are not scheduled to reset for three or more years. The Company’s mortgage loans do not include interest terms described as temporary introductory rates below current market rates. At December 31, 2011, 44% of the residential real estate mortgages and 50% of the HELOC balances were secured by properties which are located in California. The Company also has exposure to concentration risk from its margin and securities lending activities collateralized by securities of a single issuer or industry. The Company has indirect exposure to U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral to secure its resale agreements. The Company’s primary credit exposure on these resale transactions is with its counterparty. The Company would have exposure to the U.S. Government and agency securities only in the event of the counterparty’s default on the resale agreements. The fair value of U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral for resale agreements totaled $18.3 billion at December 31, 2011. European Holdings The Company has exposure to non-sovereign financial institutions in Europe. The following table shows the amortized cost and fair values of cash equivalents, cash segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes, securities available for sale, and securities held to maturity by each country in Europe in which the issuer or counterparty is domiciled. The Company has no direct exposure to sovereign governments in Europe. The Company does not have unfunded commitments to counterparties in Europe, nor does it have exposure as a result of credit default protection purchased or sold separately as of December 31, 2011. The determination of the domicile of exposure varies by the type of investment. For time deposits and certificates of deposit, the exposure is grouped in the country in which the financial institution is chartered under the regulatory framework of the European country. For asset-backed commercial paper, the exposure is grouped by the country of the sponsoring bank that provides the credit and liquidity support for such instruments. For corporate debt securities, the exposure is grouped by the country in which the issuer is domiciled. In situations in which the Company invests in a corporate debt security of a U.S. subsidiary of a European parent company, such holdings will be attributable to the European country only if significant reliance is placed on the European parent company for credit support underlying the security. For substantially all of the holdings listed below, the issuers or counterparties were financial institutions. All of the Company’s resale agreements, which are included in investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes, are collateralized by U.S. government securities. Additionally, the Company’s securities lending activities are collateralized by cash. Therefore, the Company’s resale agreements and securities lending activities are not included in the table below even if the counterparty is a European institution. - 39 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Fair Value as of December 31, 2011 Denmark France Germany Netherlands Sweden Switzerland UnitedKingdom Total Cash equivalents: Time deposits $ — $ 850 $ 389 $ — $ — $ — $ 200 $ 1,439 Commercial paper — 350 20 — — — 200 570 Cash segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes: Trust deposits — — 400 — — — — 400 Securities available for sale: Certificates of deposit — 300 150 300 499 550 700 2,499 Corporate debt securities 214 74 — 187 97 — 550 1,122 Securities held to maturity: Corporate debt securities — — — — 117 100 — 217 Total fair value $ 214 $ 1,574 $ 959 $ 487 $ 713 $ 650 $ 1,650 $ 6,247 Total amortized cost $ 212 $ 1,575 $ 959 $ 492 $ 716 $ 650 $ 1,650 $ 6,254 Maturities: Overnight $ — $ 1,200 $ 789 $ — $ — $ — $ 200 $ 2,189 1 day – < 6 months — 174 20 200 200 150 700 1,444 6 months – < 1 year — 100 — — 117 274 650 1,141 1 year – 2 years 214 100 150 187 299 126 100 1,176 > 2 years — — — 100 97 100 — 297 Total fair value $ 214 $ 1,574 $ 959 $ 487 $ 713 $ 650 $ 1,650 $ 6,247 In addition to the direct holdings of European companies listed above, the Company also has indirect exposure to Europe through its investments in Schwab sponsored money market funds (collectively, the Funds) resulting from clearing activities. At December 31, 2011, the Company had $332 million in investments in these Funds. Certain of the Funds’ positions include certificates of deposits, time deposits, commercial paper and corporate debt securities issued by counterparties in Europe. Management mitigates exposure to European holdings by employing a separate team of credit analysts that evaluate each issuer, counterparty, and country. Management monitors its exposure to European issuers by 1) performing risk assessments of the foreign countries, which include evaluating the size of the country and economy, currency trends, political landscape and the countries’ regulatory environment and developments, 2) performing ad hoc stress tests that evaluate the impact of sovereign governments’ debt write-downs on the issuers and counterparties to our investments, 3) reviewing publicly available stress tests that are published by various regulators in the European market, 4) establishing credit and maturity limits by issuer, and 5) monitoring aggregate exposures by country. Market Risk Market risk is the potential for changes in revenue or the value of financial instruments held by the Company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices or market conditions. For discussion of the Company’s market risk, see “Item 7A – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” Fiduciary Risk Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. The Company attempts to manage this risk by establishing procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the - 40 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) primary responsibility for adherence to the procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees. Legal and Regulatory Risk The Company faces significant legal and compliance risk in its business, and the volume of litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services firms and the amount of damages claimed have been increasing. Among other things, these risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for Company products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of the Company’s controls. Claims against the Company may increase due to a variety of factors, such as if clients suffer losses during a period of deteriorating equity market conditions, as the Company increases the level of advice it provides to clients, and as the Company enhances the services it provides to IAs. In addition, the Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, and SROs, and such regulation is becoming increasingly extensive and complex. The Company attempts to manage legal and compliance risk through policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid litigation claims and prevent or detect violations of applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, client privacy, employment policies, and contracts management. Despite the Company’s efforts to maintain an effective compliance program and internal controls, legal breaches and rule violations could result in reputational harm, significant losses and disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on the Company’s business activities. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company uses fair value measurements to record certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value, and to determine fair value disclosures. Assets are measured at fair value using quoted prices or market-based information and accordingly are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 measurements in accordance with the fair value hierarchy described in fair value measurement accounting guidance. Liabilities recorded at fair value were not material at December 31, 2011 or 2010. See “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 17. Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities” for more information on the Company’s assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. When available, the Company uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. When quoted prices do not exist, the Company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets. The Company validates prices received from the pricing services using various methods, including comparison to prices received from additional pricing services, comparison to quoted market prices, where available, comparison to internal valuation models, and review of other relevant market data. The Company does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in a material difference in the recorded amounts. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company did not adjust prices received from independent third-party pricing services. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. While the majority of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position and reported financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy. - 41 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Other-than-Temporary Impairment of Securities Available for Sale and Securities Held to Maturity: Management evaluates whether securities available for sale and securities held to maturity are other-than-temporarily impaired (OTTI) on a quarterly basis. Debt securities with unrealized losses are considered OTTI if the Company intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such security prior to any anticipated recovery. If management determines that a security is OTTI under these circumstances, the impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the entire difference between the amortized cost and the then-current fair value. A security is also OTTI if management does not expect to recover the amortized cost of the security. In this circumstance, management utilizes cash flow models to estimate the expected future cash flow from the securities and to estimate the credit loss. The impairment recognized in earnings is measured by the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost of the security. Expected cash flows are discounted using the security’s effective interest rate. The evaluation of whether the Company expects to recover the amortized cost of a security is inherently judgmental. The evaluation includes the assessment of several bond performance indicators including: the portion of the underlying loans that are delinquent (30 days, 60 days, 90+ days), in bankruptcy, in foreclosure or converted to real estate owned; the actual amount of loss incurred on the underlying loans in which the property has been foreclosed and sold; the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security available to absorb credit losses on the underlying loans; the current price and magnitude of the unrealized loss; and whether the Company has received all scheduled principal and interest payments. Management uses cash flow models to further assess the likelihood of other-than-temporary impairment for the Company’s non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. To develop the cash flow models, the Company uses forecasted loss severity, prepayment speeds (i.e. the rate at which the principal on underlying loans are paid down), and default rates over the securities’ expected remaining maturities. Valuation of Goodwill: The Company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually, or whenever indications of impairment exist. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, resulting in an impairment charge for this excess. The Company has elected April 1st as its annual goodwill impairment testing date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on April 1, 2011, management estimated the fair value of each of the Company’s reporting units (generally defined as the Company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) and compared this value to the carrying value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value, and therefore management concluded that no amount of goodwill was impaired. The estimated fair value of the reporting units was established using a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit. Adverse changes in the Company’s planned business operations such as unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit, or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the Company’s recorded goodwill. Allowance for Loan Losses: The adequacy of the allowance is reviewed quarterly by management, taking into consideration current economic conditions, the existing loan portfolio composition, past loss experience, and risks inherent in the portfolio. The process to establish an allowance for loan losses utilizes loan-level statistical models that estimate prepayments, defaults, and probable losses for the loan segments based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the segments. The methodology considers the effects of borrower behavior and a variety of factors including, but not limited to, interest rates, housing price movements as measured by a housing price index, economic conditions, estimated defaults and foreclosures measured by historical and expected delinquencies, changes in prepayment speeds, loan-to-value ratios, past loss experience, estimates of future loss severities, borrower credit risk measured by FICO scores, and the adequacy of collateral. The methodology also evaluates concentrations in the loan segments including loan products, year of origination, geographical distribution of collateral, and the portion of borrowers who have other client relationships with the Company. The more significant variables considered include a measure of delinquency roll rates, loss severity, housing prices, and interest rates. Delinquency roll rates (i.e., the rates at which loans transition through delinquency stages and ultimately result - 42 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) in a loss) are estimated from the Company’s historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information. Loss severity estimates are based on the Company’s historical loss experience and market trends. Housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values. Factors affecting the home price index include: housing inventory, unemployment, interest rates, and inflation expectations. Interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths. This quarterly analysis results in a loss factor that is applied to the outstanding balances to determine the allowance for loan loss for each loan segment. Legal Reserve: Reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, insurance coverage and indemnification, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved. The Company’s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee. Additionally, management has reviewed with the Audit Committee the Company’s significant estimates discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS In addition to historical information, this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential for changes in revenue or the value of financial instruments held by the Company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices or market conditions. For the Company’s market risk related to interest rates, a sensitivity analysis, referred to as a net interest revenue simulation model, is shown below. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on its interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources that finance these assets. Net interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may re-price at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short and long-term interest rates. Interest-earning assets include residential real estate loans and mortgage-backed securities. These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and to changes to prepayment levels, which tend to increase in a declining rate environment. To mitigate the risk of loss, the Company has established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk, and monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interest-earning assets and funding sources. To remain within these guidelines, the Company manages the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios. Because the Company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients, the rates charged on margin loans, and controls the composition of its investment securities, it has some ability to manage its net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions. The Company is also subject to market risk as a result of fluctuations in equity prices. The Company’s direct holdings of equity securities and its associated exposure to equity prices are not material. The Company is indirectly exposed to equity market fluctuations in connection with securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers, and customer securities loaned out as part of the Company’s securities lending activities. Equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity, margin borrowing, and overall client engagement with the Company. Additionally, the Company earns mutual fund service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets. Fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue earned by the Company. Financial instruments held by the Company are also subject to liquidity risk – that is, the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument. Recent conditions in the credit markets have significantly reduced market liquidity in a wide range of financial instruments, including the types of instruments held by the Company, and fair value can differ significantly from the value implied by the credit quality and actual performance of the instrument’s underlying cash flows. Financial instruments held by the Company are also subject to valuation risk as a result of changes in valuations of the underlying collateral, such as housing prices in the case of residential real estate loans and mortgage-backed securities. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and securities available for sale, see “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Current Market and Regulatory Environment”. The Company’s market risk related to financial instruments held for trading and forward sale and interest rate lock commitments related to its loans held for sale portfolio is not material. Net Interest Revenue Simulation The Company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulation model (the model) includes all interest-sensitive assets and liabilities. Key variables in the model include the repricing of financial instruments, prepayment, reinvestment, and product pricing assumptions. The Company uses constant balances and market rates in the model assumptions in order to minimize the number of variables and to better isolate risks. The simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate net interest - 45 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION revenue or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies, including changes in asset and liability mix. As represented by the simulations presented below, the Company’s investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall (i.e., interest-earning assets generally reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities). The simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As the Company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood the Company would take steps to manage any additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment. The following table shows the results of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to the Company’s current market rates forecast on simulated net interest revenue over the next 12 months beginning December 31, 2011 and 2010. December 31, 2011 2010 Increase of 100 basis points 19.1 % 13.5 % Decrease of 100 basis points (8.1 %) (4.8 %) The sensitivities shown in the simulation reflect the fact that short-term interest rates in 2011 remained at historically low levels, including the federal funds target rate, which was unchanged at a range of zero to 0.25%. The current low interest rate environment limits the extent to which the Company can reduce interest expense paid on funding sources in a declining interest rate scenario. A decline in interest rates could therefore negatively impact the yield on the Company’s investment portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense, further compressing net interest margin. Any increases in short-term interest rates result in a greater impact as yields on interest-earning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources. - 46 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION",2023-12-30 18:56:30.725296

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Management of the Company focuses on several key client activity and financial metrics in evaluating the Company’s financial position and operating performance. Results for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 are: Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate1-Year2011-2012 2012 2011 2010 Client Activity Metrics: Net new client assets (1) (in billions) (4 %) $ 139.7 $ 145.9 $ 26.6 Client assets (in billions, at year end) 16 % $ 1,951.6 $ 1,677.7 $ 1,574.5 New brokerage accounts (2) (in thousands) (21 %) 900 1,138 829 Active brokerage accounts (3) (in thousands, at year end) 3 % 8,787 8,552 7,998 Company Financial Metrics: Net revenues 4 % $ 4,883 $ 4,691 $ 4,248 Expenses excluding interest 4 % 3,433 3,299 3,469 Income before taxes on income 4 % 1,450 1,392 779 Taxes on income (1 %) 522 528 325 Net income 7 % $ 928 $ 864 $ 454 Net income available to common stockholders 2 % $ 883 $ 864 $ 454 Earnings per common share – diluted (1 %) $ .69 $ .70 $ .38 Net revenue growth from prior year 4 % 10 % 1 % Pre-tax profit margin 29.7 % 29.7 % 18.3 % Return on common stockholders’ equity (4) 11 % 12 % 8 % Net revenue per average full-time equivalent employee (in thousands) 1 % $ 354 $ 350 $ 337 (1) 2012 includes inflows of $27.7 billion from mutual fund clearing services clients and $900 million from the acquisition of ThomasPartners, Inc., and outflows of $1.3 billion from the closure and/or sale of certain subsidiaries of optionsXpress Holdings, Inc. 2011 includes inflows of $56.1 billion from a mutual fund clearing services client and $7.5 billion from the acquisition of optionsXpress. 2010 includes net outflows of $51.5 billion related to the planned deconversion of a mutual fund clearing services client. (2) 2011 includes 315,000 new brokerage accounts from the acquisition of optionsXpress Holdings, Inc. (3) 2012 includes the removal of approximately 19,000 accounts as a result of the sale of certain subsidiaries of optionsXpress and 30,000 accounts due to escheatment and other factors. (4) Calculated as net income available to common stockholders divided by common stockholders’ equity. • Net new client assets is defined as the total inflows of client cash and securities to the firm less client outflows. Management believes that this metric depicts how well the Company’s products and services appeal to new and existing clients in a given operating environment. Core net new client assets is defined as net new client assets before significant one-time flows. • Client assets is the market value of all client assets custodied at the Company. Management considers client assets to be indicative of the Company’s appeal in the marketplace. Additionally, fluctuations in certain components of client assets (e.g., Mutual Fund OneSource funds) directly impact asset management and administration fees. • New brokerage accounts include all brokerage accounts opened during the period, as well as any accounts added via acquisition. This metric measures the Company’s effectiveness in attracting new clients and building stronger relationships with existing clients. • Active brokerage accounts include accounts with balances or activity within the preceding eight months. This metric is an indicator of the Company’s success in both attracting and retaining clients. - 17 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) • Management believes that earnings per common share, net revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin, and return on common stockholders’ equity provide broad indicators of the Company’s overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns within the context of a given operating environment. • Net revenue per average full-time equivalent employee is considered by management to be the Company’s broadest measure of productivity. The Company’s major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue. The Company generates asset management and administration fees through its proprietary and third-party mutual fund offerings, as well as fee-based advisory solutions. Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue are impacted by securities valuations, interest rates, the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing funding sources, the Company’s ability to attract new clients, and client activity levels. The Company generates trading revenue through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenue primarily from trading activity in client fixed income securities. Trading revenue is impacted by trading volumes, the volatility of prices in the equity and fixed income markets, and commission rates. 2012 Compared to 2011 The broad equity markets improved during 2012 compared to 2011, as the Nasdaq Composite Index, Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, and Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 16%, 13%, and 7%, respectively. While the federal funds target rate remained unchanged at a range of zero to 0.25%, the average three-month Treasury Bill yield increased by 4 basis points to 0.08% during 2012 compared to 2011. At the same time, the average 10-year Treasury yield decreased by 98 basis points to 1.78%. Despite continuing economic and interest rate challenges during the year, the Company’s sustained client focus helped deliver strong key client activity metrics in 2012. While net new client assets decreased slightly by 4% to $139.7 billion in 2012, core net new client assets totaled $112.4 billion, up 37% from $82.3 billion in 2011. Total client assets ended the year at a record $1.95 trillion, up 16% from 2011. In addition, the Company added 900,000 new brokerage accounts to its client base during 2012, and active brokerage accounts reached a record 8.8 million, up 3% from 2011. Net revenues increased by 4% in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to increases in asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and other revenue – net, partially offset by a decrease in trading revenue. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to increases in advice solutions fees and other asset management and administration fees. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the effect of low overall interest rates and higher amortization of premiums relating to mortgage-backed securities. Other revenue – net increased primarily due to a pre-tax gain of $70 million relating to a confidential resolution of a vendor dispute in the second quarter of 2012. Trading revenue decreased primarily due to lower daily average revenue trades, partially offset by the inclusion of optionsXpress’ trading activity from its acquisition in September 2011. Expenses excluding interest were higher by 4% in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of optionsXpress’ expenses. Taxes on income in 2012 include a non-recurring state tax benefit of $20 million recorded in the third quarter of 2012. Overall, growth in the Company’s client base and ongoing expense discipline helped the Company increase net income by 7% in 2012 from 2011, and achieve a pre-tax profit margin of 29.7% and return on common stockholders’ equity of 11% in 2012. 2011 Compared to 2010 Economic and market conditions were challenging throughout 2011, marked by volatility in the equity markets, lower market valuations, and further declines in interest rates. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, Nasdaq Composite Index, and Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased on average 6%, 5%, and 4%, respectively, between the first and second halves of the year. The federal funds target rate remained unchanged during the year at a range of zero to 0.25% and the average three-month Treasury Bill and average 10-year Treasury yields declined by 8 and 43 basis points to 0.04% and 2.76%, respectively. - 18 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The Company’s key client activity metrics in 2011 were stable in the midst of a weakened economic and market environment. Net new client assets totaled $145.9 billion in 2011. Core net new client assets totaled $82.3 billion in 2011, up 5% from $78.1 billion in 2010. Total client assets ended the year at $1.68 trillion, up 7% from 2010. In addition, the Company added 1.1 million new brokerage accounts to its client base during 2011 and ended the year serving 8.6 million active brokerage accounts. Net revenues increased by 10% in 2011 from 2010 due to increases in all of the Company’s major sources of net revenues. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to an increase in advice solutions fees and continued asset inflows, partially offset by a decrease in net money market mutual fund fees. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets during the year, partially offset by the effect of lower interest rate spreads resulting from higher amortization of premiums relating to residential mortgage-backed securities caused by higher mortgage prepayments in 2011. Trading revenue increased primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades and the addition of optionsXpress’ trading activity. While total expenses excluding interest were lower by 5% in 2011 compared to 2010, the Company experienced increases in compensation and benefits, professional services, occupancy and equipment, and advertising and market development expenses in aggregate of $266 million in 2011 compared to 2010. Significant charges in 2010 included class action litigation and regulatory reserves relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund®, losses recognized for Schwab money market mutual funds, and a charge relating to the termination of the Company’s Invest First® and WorldPoints(a) Visa(b) credit card program for a total of $482 million. As a result of the Company’s ongoing investment in clients and sustained expense discipline, the Company achieved a pre-tax profit margin of 29.7% and return on common stockholders’ equity of 12% in 2011. CURRENT MARKET AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS As discussed above, interest rates remained at low levels during 2012. To the extent rates remain at these low levels, the Company’s net interest revenue will continue to be constrained, even as growth in average balances helps to increase such revenue. The low interest rate environment also affects asset management and administration fees. While net money market mutual fund fees improved in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to sustained improvement in short-term interest rates, the overall yields on certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds have remained at levels at or below the management fees on those funds. The Company continues to waive a portion of its management fees so that the funds can maintain a positive return to clients. These and other money market mutual funds may not be able to replace maturing securities with securities of equal or higher yields. As a result, the yields on such funds may remain around or decline from their current levels, and therefore below the management fees on those funds. To the extent this occurs, asset management and administration fees may be negatively affected. The Company recorded net impairment losses of $32 million related to certain non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities in 2012 primarily due to further credit deterioration of the securities’ underlying loans. Further deterioration in the performance of the underlying loans in the Company’s non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio could result in the recognition of additional impairment losses. The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law in July 2010. Among other things, the legislation transferred the supervision and regulation of CSC from the OTS to the Federal Reserve and supervision and regulation of Schwab Bank from the OTS to the OCC; both transfers were effective July 21, 2011. In 2012, the Federal Reserve issued notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRs) to meet certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and to align current capital rules with the BASEL III capital standards. The NPRs would subject all savings and loan holding companies, including CSC, to consolidated capital requirements. In (a) WorldPoints is a registered trademark of FIA Card Services, N.A. (b) Visa is a registered trademark of Visa International Service Association. - 19 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) addition, the NPRs would establish more restrictive capital definitions, higher risk-weightings for certain asset classes, higher minimum capital ratios, and capital buffers. The Company expects the capital standard rules to be phased in under an extended time frame after adoption. The comment period for the NPRs ended on October 22, 2012, and the NPRs are subject to further modification. CSC continues to monitor developments in order to assess the impact of the NPRs but does not expect them to have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. The Company is pursuing lawsuits in state court in San Francisco for rescission and damages against issuers, underwriters, and dealers of individual non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities on which the Company has experienced realized and unrealized losses. The lawsuits allege that offering documents for the securities contained material untrue and misleading statements about the securities and the underwriting standards and credit quality of the underlying loans. On January 27, 2012, and July 24, 2012, the court denied defendants’ motions to dismiss the claims with respect to all but 3 of the 51 securities, and discovery is proceeding. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion presents an analysis of the Company’s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010. Net Revenues The Company’s major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue. Asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue increased, while trading revenue decreased in 2012 as compared to 2011. Asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue all increased in 2011 as compared to 2010.

The Company earns mutual fund service fees for shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. These fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in these funds. The Company also earns asset management fees for advice solutions, which include advisory and managed account services that are based on the daily balances of client assets subject to the specific fee for service. The fair values of client assets included in proprietary and third-party mutual funds are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data. Other asset management and administration fees include various asset based fees, such as third-party mutual fund service fees, trust fees, 401k record keeping fees, and mutual fund clearing and other service fees. Asset management and administration fees may vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees, see “Current Market and Regulatory Environment and Other Developments.” Asset management and administration fees increased by $115 million, or 6%, in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to increases in advice solutions fees and other asset management and administration fees. Asset management and administration fees increased by $106 million, or 6%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to an increase in advice solutions fees, partially offset by a decrease in mutual fund service fees. Mutual fund service fees were relatively flat in 2012 from 2011, which reflected growth in client asset balances invested in money market mutual funds, equity and bond funds, and Mutual Fund OneSource funds, offset by the effect of lower yields on certain mutual fund assets. Mutual fund service fees decreased by $59 million, or 5%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to a decrease in net money market mutual fund fees as a result of lower yields on fund assets, partially offset by higher Mutual Fund OneSource fees. Advice solutions fees increased by $58 million, or 11%, in 2012 from 2011 and by $138 million, or 36%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to growth in client assets enrolled in retail advisory and managed account programs, including Windhaven® and Schwab Managed PortfoliosTM. The increase in advice solutions fees in 2011 from 2010 was also due to temporary fees rebates of $63 million, which reduced advice solutions fees in 2010 under a rebate program that ended in 2010. Other asset management and administration fees increased by $43 million, or 14%, in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to an increase in third-party mutual fund service fees as a result of an increase in client asset balances invested in other third-party mutual funds. Net Interest Revenue Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies. The Company’s investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall (i.e., interest-earning assets generally reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities). When interest rates fall, the Company may attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending the maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lock in asset yields, and by lowering rates paid to clients on interest-bearing liabilities. Since the Company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients, as well as the rates charged on receivables from brokerage clients, and also controls the composition of its investment securities, it has some ability to manage its net interest spread. The current low interest rate environment limits the extent to which the Company can reduce interest expense paid on funding sources. However, the spread is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on net interest revenue, see “Current Market and Regulatory Environment and Other Developments.” - 21 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The Company’s interest-earning assets are financed primarily by brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients. Non-interest-bearing funding sources include non-interest-bearing brokerage client cash balances and proceeds from stock-lending activities, as well as stockholders’equity. In clearing their clients’ trades, Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. hold cash balances payable to clients. In most cases, Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. pay their clients interest on cash balances awaiting investment, and in turn invest these funds and earn interest revenue. Receivables from brokerage clients consist primarily of margin loans to brokerage clients. Margin loans are loans made to clients on a secured basis to purchase securities. Pursuant to applicable regulations, client cash balances that are not used for margin lending are generally segregated into investment accounts that are maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients, which are recorded in cash and investments segregated on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. When investing segregated client cash balances, Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. must adhere to applicable regulations that restrict investments to securities guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, participation certificates, mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association, deposits held at U.S. banks and thrifts, and resale agreements collateralized by qualified securities. Additionally, Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. have established policies for the minimum credit quality and maximum maturity of these investments. Schwab Bank maintains investment portfolios for liquidity as well as to invest funds from deposits in excess of loans to banking clients and liquidity limits. Schwab Bank’s securities available for sale include mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency notes, commercial paper, and other securities. Schwab Bank’s securities held to maturity include mortgage-backed and other securities. Schwab Bank lends funds to banking clients primarily in the form of mortgage loans and HELOCs. These loans are largely funded by interest-bearing deposits from banking clients.

(2) Amounts have been calculated based on amortized cost. Net interest revenue increased in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets, primarily securities available for sale, partially offset by the effect of low overall interest rates and higher amortization of premiums - 22 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) relating to mortgage-backed securities. Growth in the average deposit balances from banking clients funded the increase in the balance of securities available for sale. Net interest revenue increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the effect of lower interest rate spreads resulting from higher amortization of premiums relating to residential mortgage-backed securities. The growth in average balances of deposits from banking clients and payables to brokerage clients funded the increases in the balances of receivables from brokerage clients, securities available for sale, and securities held to maturity. Further declines in interest rates in 2011 accelerated the prepayment activity in the Company’s portfolio of residential mortgage-backed securities, which resulted in higher premium amortization. Trading Revenue Trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenue is affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. Principal transaction revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from trading activity in client fixed income securities. To accommodate clients’ fixed income trading activity, the Company maintains positions in fixed income securities, including state and municipal debt obligations, U.S. Government, corporate debt, and other securities. The difference between the price at which the Company buys and sells securities to and from its clients and other broker-dealers is recognized as principal transaction revenue. Principal transaction revenue also includes unrealized gains and losses on these securities positions. Factors that influence principal transaction revenue include the volume of client trades and market price volatility. Trading revenue decreased by $59 million, or 6%, in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to lower daily average revenue trades, partially offset by the inclusion of optionsXpress’ trading activity for the full year. Trading revenue increased by $97 million, or 12%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades and the addition of optionsXpress’ trading activity starting in September 2011. Daily average revenue trades decreased by 7% in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to a lower volume of equity and mutual fund trades, partially offset by a higher volume of option and future trades as a result of the inclusion of optionsXpress. Daily average revenue trades increased by 12% in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to a higher volume of option, equity, and mutual fund trades. Average revenue per revenue trade remained relatively flat in 2012 and 2011.

(2) Includes daily average revenue trades, trades by clients in asset-based pricing relationships, and all commission-free trades, including the Company’s Mutual Fund OneSource funds and ETFs, and other proprietary products. Clients’ daily average trades is an indicator of client engagement with securities markets. (3) October 29 and 30, 2012, were not included as trading days due to weather-related market closures. Other Revenue – Net Other revenue – net includes nonrecurring gains and losses, realized gains and losses on sales of securities available for sale, order flow revenue, software fees from the Company’s portfolio management services, exchange processing fees, and other service fees. Other revenue – net increased by $96 million, or 60%, in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a pre-tax gain of $70 million relating to a confidential resolution of a vendor dispute in the second quarter of 2012. In November 2012, the - 23 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Company began receiving additional order flow rebates from market venues to which client orders are routed for execution. Order flow revenue increased by $23 million due to this revenue and the inclusion of a full year of optionsXpress’ order flow revenue. In December 2012, CSC redeemed the remaining outstanding portion of its 4.950% Senior Notes of $494 million that were due in 2014, which resulted in the payment of a make-whole premium of $31 million that was recorded in other revenue – net. Other revenue – net also included realized gains of $35 million from the sales of securities available for sale. Other revenue – net increased by $25 million, or 19%, in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increases in software and exchange processing fees, as well as the addition of education services revenue from the acquisition of optionsXpress. Provision for Loan Losses The provision for loan losses was relatively flat in 2012 from 2011, reflecting stable levels of delinquencies and nonaccrual loans experienced in 2012. The provision for loan losses decreased by $9 million, or 33%, in 2011 from 2010 due to a decrease in overall expected loss rates resulting primarily from a decrease in first mortgage loan delinquencies. Charge-offs were $16 million, $19 million, and $20 million in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. For further discussion on the Company’s credit risk and the allowance for loan losses, see “Risk Management – Credit Risk” and “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 7. Loans to Banking Clients and Related Allowance for Loan Losses.” Net Impairment Losses on Securities Net impairment losses on securities were $32 million, $31 million, and $36 million in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. These charges relate to certain non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, which experienced further credit deterioration of the securities’ underlying loans. For further discussion, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 6. Securities Available for Sale and Securities Held to Maturity.” Expenses Excluding Interest As shown in the table below, expenses excluding interest were higher in 2012 compared to 2011, which was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of optionsXpress’ expenses and amortization of intangible assets relating to the optionsXpress acquisition. Expenses excluding interest were lower in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to certain significant charges in 2010, including class action litigation and regulatory reserves relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund and losses recognized for Schwab money market mutual funds. The decrease in expenses excluding interest caused by these charges in 2010 was offset by increases in compensation and benefits, professional services, occupancy and equipment, and advertising and market development expenses in 2011. Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate2011-2012 2012 2011 2010 Compensation and benefits 4 % $ 1,803 $ 1,732 $ 1,573 Professional services — 388 387 341 Occupancy and equipment 3 % 311 301 272 Advertising and market development 6 % 241 228 196 Communications — 220 220 207 Depreciation and amortization 26 % 196 155 146 Class action litigation and regulatory reserve N/M — 7 320 Money market mutual fund charges — — — 132 Other 2 % 274 269 282 Total expenses excluding interest 4 % $ 3,433 $ 3,299 $ 3,469 Expenses as a percentage of total net revenues: Total expenses excluding interest 70 % 70 % 82 % Advertising and market development 5 % 5 % 5 % N/M Not meaningful. - 24 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits expense includes salaries and wages, incentive compensation, and related employee benefits and taxes. Incentive compensation includes variable compensation, discretionary bonuses, and stock-based compensation. Variable compensation includes payments to certain individuals based on their sales performance. Discretionary bonuses are based on the Company’s overall performance as measured by earnings per common share, and therefore will fluctuate with this measure. Stock-based compensation primarily includes employee and board of director stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock awards. Compensation and benefits expense increased by $71 million, or 4%, in 2012 from 2011 due to increases in salaries and wages, incentive compensation and employee benefits and other expense. Compensation and benefits expense increased by $159 million, or 10%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to increases in salaries and wages and incentive compensation. The following table shows a comparison of certain compensation and benefits components and employee data: Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate2011-2012 2012 2011 2010 Salaries and wages 3 % $ 1,043 $ 1,012 $ 931 Incentive compensation 5 % 466 444 386 Employee benefits and other 7 % 294 276 256 Total compensation and benefits expense 4 % $ 1,803 $ 1,732 $ 1,573 Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total net revenues: Salaries and wages 21 % 22 % 22 % Incentive compensation 10 % 9 % 9 % Employee benefits and other 6 % 6 % 6 % Total compensation and benefits expense 37 % 37 % 37 % Full-time equivalent employees (in thousands) (1) At year end (2 %) 13.8 14.1 12.8 Average 3 % 13.8 13.4 12.6 (1) Includes full-time, part-time and temporary employees, and persons employed on a contract basis, and excludes employees of outsourced service providers. Salaries and wages increased in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to an increase in average full-time employees from the inclusion of a full year of optionsXpress’ employees. The increase in salaries and wages was partially offset by a decrease in persons employed on a contract basis. Incentive compensation increased in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to higher variable compensation resulting from product sales performance in the Company’s branch offices. Employee benefits and other expense increased in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to increases in payroll taxes and the Company’s 401(k) plan contribution expense due to increases in average full-time employees and incentive compensation, and an increase in the Company’s deferred compensation plan expense as a result of improvement in the broad equity markets. Salaries and wages increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to increases in full-time employees and persons employed on a contract basis. The increase in full-time employees was partially due to the addition of full-time employees from the optionsXpress acquisition. Incentive compensation increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to an increase in discretionary bonuses and higher variable compensation. Discretionary bonuses increased based on the Company’s overall performance in 2011, as well as an increase in full time employees. Variable compensation was higher primarily due to the integration of Windhaven, which was acquired in November 2010. Employee benefits and other expense increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to increases in payroll taxes and the Company’s 401(k) plan contribution expense as a result of increases in incentive compensation and full-time employees. - 25 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Expenses Excluding Compensation and Benefits Professional services expense increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to an increase in fees relating to the Company’s technology investments and client facing infrastructure, and approximately $10 million in costs relating to the integration of optionsXpress. Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to an increase in software maintenance expense relating to the Company’s information technology systems. Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to an increase in the Company’s investments in data processing equipment. Advertising and market development expense increased in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of optionsXpress’ expenses, which includes media, and the Company’s increased spending on customer promotions. Advertising and market development expense increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to higher spending on customer and branch promotions and electronic media. Communications expense increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to higher telephone service expense and third-party news and information expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2012 and 2011 primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets relating to the optionsXpress acquisition. The increase in 2011 from 2010 was also due to the amortization of intangible assets resulting from the Windhaven acquisition. In 2011 and 2010, the Company recorded class action litigation and regulatory reserves relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund. For further discussion of the Schwab YieldPlus Fund litigation and regulatory matters, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 21. Class Action Litigation and Regulatory Reserve and Money Market Mutual Fund Charges.” In 2010, the Company decided to cover the net remaining losses of $132 million recognized by Schwab money market mutual funds as a result of their investments in a single structured investment vehicle that defaulted in 2008. Other expense was lower in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a charge of $30 million in 2010, relating to the Company’s former Invest First and WorldPoints Visa credit cards, as the Company ended its sponsorship due to challenging credit card industry economics. Taxes on Income The Company’s effective income tax rate on income before taxes was 36.0% in 2012, 37.9% in 2011, and 41.7% in 2010. The decrease in 2012 from 2011 was primarily due to the recognition of a non-recurring state tax benefit of $20 million in the third quarter of 2012. The decrease in 2011 from 2010 was due to a lower effective state income tax rate in 2011 and the impact of non-deductible penalties relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund regulatory settlements in 2010. Segment Information The Company provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments – Investor Services and Institutional Services. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services to individual investors. The Institutional Services segment provides custodial, trading, and support services to independent investment advisors. The Institutional Services segment also provides retirement plan services, specialty brokerage services, and mutual fund clearing services, and supports the availability of Schwab proprietary mutual funds and collective trust funds on third-party platforms. Banking revenues and expenses are allocated to the Company’s two segments based on which segment services the client. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments on a pre-tax basis, excluding items such as significant nonrecurring gains, impairment charges on non-financial assets, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and significant restructuring and - 26 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) other charges.

Investor Services Net revenues were relatively flat in 2012 compared to 2011 as the increases in asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and other revenue – net were largely offset by a decrease in trading revenue. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to an increase in advice solutions fees relating to Windhaven, partially offset by a decrease in net money market mutual fund fees. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the effect of low overall interest rates and higher amortization of premiums relating to mortgage-backed securities. Other revenue – net increased primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of optionsXpress’ order flow revenue and other fees. Trading revenue decreased primarily due to lower daily average revenue trades, partially offset by the inclusion of optionsXpress’ trading activity for the full year. Expenses excluding interest increased by - 27 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) $102 million, or 5%, in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of optionsXpress’ compensation and benefits, advertising and market development, and depreciation and amortization expenses. Net revenues increased by $344 million, or 12%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue, asset management and administration fees, and trading revenue. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets during the year, partially offset by the effect of higher premium amortization relating to residential mortgage-backed securities caused by higher mortgage prepayments in 2011. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to an increase in advice solutions fees and continued asset inflows, partially offset by decrease in net money market mutual fund fees. Trading revenue increased primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades and the addition of optionsXpress. Expenses excluding interest increased by $196 million, or 9%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits, professional services, and advertising and market development expenses, which included the integration of optionsXpress. Institutional Services Net revenues increased by $81 million, or 5%, in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to increases in asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue, partially offset by a decrease in trading revenue. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to an increase in third-party mutual fund service fees. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the effect of low overall interest rates and higher amortization of premiums relating to mortgage-backed securities. Trading revenue decreased primarily due to lower daily average revenue trades. Expenses excluding interest increased by $30 million, or 3%, in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits and occupancy and equipment expenses. Net revenues increased by $99 million, or 7%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue, asset management and administration fees, and trading revenue. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets during the year, partially offset by the effect of higher premium amortization relating to residential mortgage-backed securities caused by higher mortgage prepayments in 2011. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to an increase in mutual fund service fees relating to the Company’s Mutual Fund OneSource funds as a result of continued asset inflows, offset by net money market mutual fund fees waivers. Trading revenue increased primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades. Expenses excluding interest increased by $79 million, or 8%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits and professional services expenses. Unallocated Other revenue – net in 2012 includes a pre-tax gain of $70 million relating to a confidential resolution of a vendor dispute in the second quarter of 2012. Expenses excluding interest in 2010 include class action litigation and regulatory reserves relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund and a charge relating to the Company’s decision to cover the net remaining losses recognized by Schwab money market mutual funds as a result of their investments in a single structured investment vehicle that defaulted in 2008. Subsequent Changes to Segment Information In the first quarter of 2013, the Company realigned its reportable segments as a result of recent organizational changes. The Institutional segment will be renamed to Advisor Services. The Retirement Plan Services, Corporate Brokerage Retirement Products (formerly part of Retirement Business Services), and Corporate Brokerage Services business units will be reallocated to the Investor Services segment. The Company will recast the segment information based on this realignment in the first quarter of 2013. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CSC conducts substantially all of its business through its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company’s capital structure is designed to provide each subsidiary with capital and liquidity to meet its operational needs and regulatory requirements. - 28 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) CSC is a savings and loan holding company and Schwab Bank, CSC’s depository institution, is a federal savings bank. CSC is subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve and Schwab Bank is subject to supervision and regulation by the OCC. Liquidity CSC CSC’s liquidity needs arise from funding its subsidiaries’ operations, including margin and mortgage lending, and transaction settlement, in addition to funding cash dividends, acquisitions, investments, short- and long-term debt, and managing statutory capital requirements. CSC’s liquidity needs are generally met through cash generated by its subsidiaries, as well as cash provided by external financing. CSC has a universal automatic shelf registration statement (Shelf Registration Statement) on file with the SEC which enables CSC to issue debt, equity and other securities. CSC maintains excess liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments to cover daily funding needs and to support growth in the Company’s business. Generally, CSC does not hold liquidity at its subsidiaries in excess of amounts deemed sufficient to support the subsidiaries’ operations, including any regulatory capital requirements. Schwab, Schwab Bank, and optionsXpress, Inc. are subject to regulatory requirements that may restrict them from certain transactions with CSC, as further discussed below. Management believes that funds generated by the operations of CSC’s subsidiaries will continue to be the primary funding source in meeting CSC’s liquidity needs, providing adequate liquidity to meet Schwab Bank’s capital guidelines, and maintaining Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc.’s net capital. While CSC is not currently subject to specific statutory capital requirements, CSC is required to serve as a source of strength for Schwab Bank and must have the ability to provide financial assistance if Schwab Bank experiences financial distress. To manage capital adequacy, the Company currently utilizes a target Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, as defined by the Federal Reserve, of at least 6%. At December 31, 2012, the Company’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 6.5%, Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 16.9%, and Total Capital Ratio was 17.0%. In January and June 2012, the Company completed offerings of its Series A and Series B preferred stock under the Shelf Registration Statement, with an aggregate liquidation preference of $885 million. CSC’s preferred stock is rated Baa2 by Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), BBB+ by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group (Standard & Poor’s), and BB+ by Fitch Ratings, Ltd (Fitch). For further discussion of these equity offerings, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 18. Stockholders’ Equity.” In August 2012, CSC completed an exchange offer with certain eligible holders of its 4.950% Senior Notes due 2014 (Old Senior Notes), whereby Old Senior Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $256 million were exchanged for the same aggregate principal amount of 3.225% Senior Notes due 2022 (New Senior Notes) and cash consideration of $19 million. On December 6, 2012, CSC issued $350 million of additional Senior Notes that mature in 2015 under the Shelf Registration Statement, which have a fixed interest rate of 0.850% with interest payable semi-annually. Additionally, on December 21, 2012, CSC redeemed all of its remaining outstanding Old Senior Notes of $494 million. In connection with the redemption, CSC paid the holders of the Old Senior Notes a make-whole premium of $31 million in addition to the $494 million principal payment. For further discussion of the Senior Notes, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 14. Borrowings.” On August 31, 2012, CSC redeemed all of the fixed-to-floating rate trust preferred securities issued by Schwab Capital Trust (Trust) of which $202 million in principal was outstanding for $207 million. The trust preferred securities were redeemed, along with the common securities issued by the Trust and held by CSC, as a result of the concurrent redemption in whole by CSC of the Junior Subordinated Notes held by the Trust which underlay the trust preferred securities. For further discussion of this redemption, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 14. Borrowings.” - 29 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The following are details of CSC’s long-term debt: December 31, 2012 ParOutstanding Maturity Interest Rate Moody’s Standard& Poor’s Fitch Senior Notes $ 1,306 2015 – 2022 0.850% to 4.45% fixed A2 A A Medium Term Notes $ 250 2017 6.375% fixed A2 A A CSC has authorization from its Board of Directors to issue unsecured commercial paper notes (Commercial Paper Notes) not to exceed $1.5 billion. Management has set a current limit for the commercial paper program of $800 million. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes may vary, but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper is not redeemable prior to maturity and cannot be voluntarily prepaid. The proceeds of the commercial paper program are to be used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2012, the amount of Commercial Paper Notes outstanding was $300 million, which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The amount outstanding was repaid on January 2, 2013. CSC’s ratings for these short-term borrowings are P1 by Moody’s, A1 by Standard & Poor’s, and F1 by Fitch. CSC maintains an $800 million committed, unsecured credit facility with a group of 11 banks, which is scheduled to expire in June 2013. This facility replaced a similar facility that expired in June 2012 and was unused in 2012. The funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes. The financial covenants under this facility require Schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, as defined, Schwab Bank to be well capitalized, as defined, and CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity. At December 31, 2012, the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was $5.8 billion (CSC’s stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2012, was $9.6 billion). Management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on CSC’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements. CSC also has direct access to $642 million of the $842 million uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines discussed below, that are primarily utilized by Schwab to manage short-term liquidity. These lines were not used by CSC during 2012. In addition, Schwab provides CSC with a $1.0 billion credit facility maturing in December 2014. There were no funds drawn under this facility at December 31, 2012. Schwab Liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts, which were $37.4 billion and $33.5 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for Schwab. Schwab is subject to regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit Schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings from CSC, paying cash dividends, or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000. At December 31, 2012, Schwab’s net capital was $1.4 billion (9% of aggregate debit balances), which was $1.1 billion in excess of its minimum required net capital and $623 million in excess of 5% of aggregate debit balances. Schwab is also subject to Rule 15c3-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and other applicable regulations that require it to maintain cash or qualified securities in a segregated reserve account for the exclusive benefit of clients. These funds are included in cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and are not available as a general source of liquidity. Most of Schwab’s assets are readily convertible to cash, consisting primarily of short-term (i.e., less than 150 days) investment-grade, interest-earning investments (the majority of which are segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients pursuant to regulatory requirements), receivables from brokerage clients, and receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing - 30 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) organizations. Client margin loans are demand loan obligations secured by readily marketable securities. Receivables from and payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations primarily represent current open transactions, which usually settle, or can be closed out, within a few business days. Schwab has a finance lease obligation related to an office building and land under a 20-year lease. The remaining finance lease obligation of $95 million at December 31, 2012, is being reduced by a portion of the lease payments over the remaining lease term of 12 years. To manage short-term liquidity, Schwab maintains uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines with a group of six banks totaling $842 million at December 31, 2012. The need for short-term borrowings arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest-earnings investments, and movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements. Schwab used such borrowings for three days in 2012, with average daily amounts borrowed of $62 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2012. To partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation, Schwab has unsecured standby letter of credit agreements (LOCs) with five banks in favor of the Options Clearing Corporation aggregating $325 million at December 31, 2012. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. Schwab satisfies the collateral requirements by arranging LOCs, in favor of these brokerage clients, which are issued by multiple banks. At December 31, 2012, the aggregate face amount of these LOCs totaled $74 million. There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs during 2012. To manage Schwab’s regulatory capital requirement, CSC provides Schwab with a $1.4 billion subordinated revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in March 2014. The amount outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2012, was $315 million. Borrowings under this subordinated lending arrangement qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab. In addition, CSC provides Schwab with a $2.5 billion credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in December 2014. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab. There were no funds drawn under this facility at December 31, 2012. Schwab Bank Schwab Bank’s liquidity needs are met through deposits from banking clients and equity capital. The excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts is swept into deposit accounts at Schwab Bank. At December 31, 2012, these balances totaled $56.9 billion. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012, the excess cash held in certain optionsXpress, Inc. brokerage accounts was swept into deposit accounts at Schwab Bank, which totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2012. Schwab Bank is subject to regulatory requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions, such as extensions of credit and repayment of loans between Schwab Bank and CSC or CSC’s other subsidiaries. In addition, Schwab Bank is required to provide notice to and may be required to obtain approval of the OCC and the Federal Reserve to declare dividends to CSC. - 31 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Schwab Bank is required to maintain capital levels as specified in federal banking laws and regulations. Failure to meet the minimum levels could result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on Schwab Bank. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2012, Schwab Bank is considered well capitalized. Schwab Bank’s regulatory capital and ratios at December 31, 2012, are as follows: Actual Minimum CapitalRequirement Minimum to beWell Capitalized Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital $ 5,707 20.0 % $ 1,139 4.0 % $ 1,709 6.0 % Total Risk-Based Capital $ 5,760 20.2 % $ 2,279 8.0 % $ 2,848 10.0 % Tier 1 Leverage $ 5,707 6.7 % $ 3,412 4.0 % $ 4,266 5.0 % Tangible Equity $ 5,707 6.7 % $ 1,706 2.0 % N/A N/A Not applicable. In the third quarter of 2012, management lowered its target Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for Schwab Bank from at least 7.5% to at least 6.25%. This change reflects Schwab Bank’s approach to lending and investing, which results in a lower risk profile relative to the industry and risk-based capital ratios significantly in excess of well capitalized levels. This allows greater flexibility in managing capital resources to either support Schwab Bank’s balance sheet growth or return capital to CSC. Schwab Bank has access to traditional funding sources such as deposits, federal funds purchased, and repurchase agreements. Additionally, Schwab Bank has access to short-term funding through the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) discount window. Amounts available under the FRB discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain of Schwab Bank’s securities available for sale and/or securities held to maturity that are pledged as collateral. Schwab Bank maintains policies and procedures necessary to access this funding and tests discount window borrowing procedures annually. At December 31, 2012, $2.8 billion was available under this arrangement. There were no funds drawn under this arrangement during 2012. Schwab Bank maintains a credit facility with the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Amounts available under this facility are dependent on the amount of Schwab Bank’s residential real estate mortgages and HELOCs that are pledged as collateral. At December 31, 2012, $5.5 billion was available under this facility. There were no funds drawn under this facility during 2012. CSC provides Schwab Bank with a $100 million short-term credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in December 2014. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab Bank. There were no funds drawn under these facilities during 2012. optionsXpress Liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts, which were $1.1 billion at December 31, 2012. Management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for optionsXpress, Inc. optionsXpress, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of optionsXpress, is a registered broker-dealer and is subject to regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit optionsXpress, Inc. from paying cash dividends or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000. At December 31, 2012, optionsXpress Inc.’s net capital was $87 million (40% of aggregate debit balances), which was $82 million in excess of its minimum required net capital and $76 million in excess of 5% of aggregate debit balances. optionsXpress, Inc. is also subject to Commodity Futures Trading Commission Regulation 1.17 (Reg. 1.17) under the Commodity Exchange Act, which also requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. optionsXpress, Inc. as a futures commission merchant, is required to maintain minimum net capital equal to the greater of its net capital requirement under - 32 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Reg. 1.17 ($1 million), or the sum of 8% of the total risk margin requirements for all positions carried in customer accounts and 8% of the total risk margin requirements for all positions carried in non-customer accounts (as defined in Reg. 1.17). Additionally, optionsXpress, Inc. is subject to Rule 15c3-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and other applicable regulations that require it to maintain cash or qualified securities in a segregated reserve account for the exclusive benefit of clients. These funds are included in cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and are not available as a general source of liquidity. CSC provides optionsXpress, Inc. with a $200 million credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in December 2014. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2012. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for optionsXpress, Inc. optionsXpress has a term loan with CSC, of which $89 million was outstanding at December 31, 2012, and it matures in December 2017. Capital Resources The Company monitors both the relative composition and absolute level of its capital structure. Management is focused on limiting the Company’s use of capital and currently targets a long-term debt to total financial capital ratio not to exceed 30%. The Company’s total financial capital (long-term debt plus stockholders’ equity) at December 31, 2012, was $11.2 billion, up $1.5 billion, or 16%, from December 31, 2011. The Company’s cash position (reported as cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated balance sheets) and cash flows are affected by changes in brokerage client cash balances and the associated amounts required to be segregated under regulatory guidelines. Timing differences between cash and investments actually segregated on a given date and the amount required to be segregated for that date may arise in the ordinary course of business and are addressed by the Company in accordance with applicable regulations. Other factors which affect the Company’s cash position and cash flows include investment activity in security portfolios, levels of capital expenditures, acquisition and divestiture activity, banking client deposit activity, brokerage and banking client loan activity, financing activity in long-term debt, payments of dividends, and repurchases and issuances of CSC’s preferred and common stock. The combination of these factors can cause significant fluctuations in the cash position during specific time periods. Long-term Debt At December 31, 2012, the Company had long-term debt of $1.6 billion, or 15% of total financial capital, that bears interest at a weighted-average rate of 3.85%. At December 31, 2011, the Company had long-term debt of $2.0 billion, or 21% of total financial capital. For further discussion of the Company’s long-term debt, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Liquidity” and “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 14. Borrowings.” In addition, the Company repaid $5 million of other long-term debt in 2012. The Company repaid $116 million of long-term debt in 2011, which included the pay off of long-term debt acquired from optionsXpress of $110 million subsequent to the acquisition date. Capital Expenditures The Company’s capital expenditures were $138 million (3% of net revenues) and $190 million (4% of net revenues) in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2012 and 2011 were primarily for capitalized costs for developing internal-use software, software and equipment relating to the Company’s information technology systems, and leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs for developing internal-use software were $61 million and $57 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Management currently anticipates that 2013 capital expenditures will be approximately 85% higher than 2012 primarily due to increased spending on buildings, leasehold improvements, and software and equipment relating to the Company’s information - 33 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) technology systems. A majority of this increase is planned to be spent on buildings and leasehold improvements related to the consolidation and relocation of the Company’s existing office campus in Denver, Colorado. As in recent years, the Company adjusts its capital expenditures periodically as business conditions change. Management believes that funds generated by its operations will continue to be the primary funding source of its capital expenditures. Equity Offerings In January 2012, the Company issued and sold 400,000 shares of fixed-to-floating rate (currently fixed at 7.000%) non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series A, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share for net proceeds of $394 million (Series A Preferred Stock). In June 2012, the Company issued and sold 485,000 shares of 6.00% non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series B, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share for net proceeds of $469 million (Series B Preferred Stock). Net proceeds received from these sales were used for general corporate purposes. For further discussion of these equity offerings, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 18. Stockholders’ Equity.” Dividends CSC paid common stock cash dividends of $308 million ($0.24 per share) and $295 million ($0.24 per share) in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Since the initial dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 95 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend rate 19 times, including a 20% increase in the third quarter of 2008. Since 1989, dividends have increased by a 23% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, the Company currently targets its cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income. CSC paid Series A Preferred Stock cash dividends of $14 million ($36.17 per share) and Series B Preferred Stock cash dividends of $14 million ($29.17 per share) in 2012. On December 12, 2012, CSC declared a semi-annual dividend of $35.00 per share of Series A Preferred Stock that is payable February 1, 2013, to stockholders of record on January 17, 2013. Under the respective terms of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, the Company’s ability to pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or to repurchase, redeem or acquire its common stock or any preferred stock ranking on parity with or junior to the relevant series of preferred stock, is subject to restrictions in the event that the Company does not declare and either pay or set aside a sum sufficient for payment of dividends on the relevant series of preferred stock for the immediately preceding dividend period. For further discussion of the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock offerings, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 18. Stockholders’ Equity.” Share Repurchases There were no repurchases of CSC’s common stock in 2012 or 2011. As of December 31, 2012, CSC had remaining authority from the Board of Directors to repurchase up to $596 million of its common stock, which does not have an expiration date. Business Acquisitions On December 14, 2012, the Company acquired ThomasPartners, Inc., a growth and dividend income-focused asset management firm, for $85 million in cash. On September 1, 2011, the Company acquired optionsXpress, an online brokerage firm primarily focused on equity option securities and futures, for total consideration of $714 million. Under the terms of the merger agreement, optionsXpress stockholders received 1.02 shares of the Company’s common stock for each share of optionsXpress stock. As a result, the Company issued 59 million shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $710 million, based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on September 1, 2011. The Company also assumed optionsXpress’ stock-based compensation awards valued at $4 million. - 34 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) For more information on these acquisitions, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 3. Business Acquisitions.” Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of its clients. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, the Company enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For information on each of these arrangements, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 15. Commitments and Contingencies.” Contractual Obligations The Company’s principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012, are shown in the following table. Management believes that funds generated by its continuing operations, as well as cash provided by external financing, will continue to be the primary funding sources in meeting these obligations. Excluded from this table are liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet that are generally short-term in nature (e.g., payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations) or without contractual payment terms (e.g., deposits from banking clients, payables to brokerage clients, and deferred compensation).

RISK MANAGEMENT Overview The Company’s business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, credit, market, liquidity, and reputational risk. Identification and management of these risks are essential to the success and financial soundness of the Company. The Board of Directors has approved an enterprise risk management framework that is commensurate with the size, risk profile, complexity, and continuing growth of the Company. Senior management takes an active role in the Company’s risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling various risks. The Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior managers of major business and control functions, is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the Company’s risk exposures and leading the continued development of the Company’s risk management policies and practices. - 35 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report into the Global Risk Committee. These sub-committees include the: • Corporate Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee, which focuses on the Company’s liquidity, capital resources, interest rate risk, and investments; • Credit and Market Risk Oversight Committee, which focuses on credit exposures resulting from client borrowing activity (e.g., margin lending activities and loans to banking clients), investing activities of certain of the Company’s proprietary funds, corporate credit and investment activity, and market risk resulting from the Company taking positions in certain securities to facilitate client trading activity; • New Products & Services Subcommittee, which reviews the risks associated with the launch of new product classes, services and offers; • Operational Risk Oversight Committee, which provides oversight of and approves operational risk management policies, risk tolerance levels, and operational risk governance processes, and includes the following subcommittees: • Information Security and Privacy Committee, which oversees information security and privacy policies, procedures and controls; and the • Model Governance Committee, which provides oversight of model risk throughout the Company. The Global Risk Committee reports regularly to the Audit and Risk Committees of the Board of Directors, which review major risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The Company’s Disclosure Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s (a) disclosure controls and procedures and (b) internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The Company’s compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and corporate risk management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring the Company’s risk management. Risk is inherent in the Company’s business. Consequently, despite the Company’s efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer unexpected losses due to operational or other risks. The following discussion highlights the Company’s policies and procedures for identification, assessment, and management of the principal areas of risk in its operations. Operational Risk Operational risk is the potential for loss due to inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events and relationships impacting CSC and/or any of its key business partners and vendors. Operational risk includes fiduciary, legal and compliance risk, and each are also described in detail below. The Company’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and the Company’s success depends, in part, on its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its technology in anticipation of evolving client needs. To the extent the Company experiences system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to its systems, linkages with third-party systems, and power failures), the Company’s business and operations could be significantly negatively impacted. To minimize business interruptions, Schwab has two data centers intended, in part, to further improve the recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency. The Company is committed to an ongoing process of upgrading, enhancing, and testing its technology systems. This effort is focused on meeting client needs, meeting market and regulatory changes, and deploying standardized technology platforms. Operational risk also includes the risk of human error, employee misconduct, external fraud, computer viruses, distributed denial of service attacks, terrorist attacks, and natural disaster. Employee misconduct could include fraud and misappropriation of client or Company assets, improper use or disclosure of confidential client or Company information, and unauthorized activities, such as transactions exceeding acceptable risks or authorized limits. External fraud includes - 36 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) misappropriation of client or Company assets by third parties, including through unauthorized access to Company systems and data and client accounts. The frequency and sophistication of such fraud attempts continue to increase. Operational risk is mitigated through a system of internal controls and risk management practices that are designed to keep operational risk and operational losses at levels appropriate to the inherent risk of the business in which the Company operates. The Company has specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and uses periodic risk self-assessments and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The Company maintains backup and recovery functions, including facilities for backup and communications, and conducts periodic testing of disaster recovery plans. The Company also maintains policies and procedures and technology to protect against fraud and unauthorized access to systems and data. Despite the Company’s risk management efforts, it is not always possible to deter or prevent technological or operational failure, or fraud or other misconduct, and the precautions taken by the Company may not be effective in all cases. The Company may be subject to litigation, losses, and regulatory actions in such cases, and may be required to expend significant additional resources to remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures. The Company also faces operational risk when it employs the services of various external vendors, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. The Company manages its exposure to external vendor risk through contractual provisions, control standards, and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance. The Company maintains policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with Company data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-public client information. The Company clearly defines for employees, contractors, and vendors the Company’s expected standards of care for confidential data. Regular training is provided by the Company in regard to data security. The Company is actively engaged in the research and development of new technologies, services, and products. The Company endeavors to protect its research and development efforts, and its brands, through the use of copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and contracts. Fiduciary Risk Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. The Company attempts to manage this risk by establishing procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees. Legal and Compliance Risk The Company faces significant legal and compliance risk in its business, and the volume of litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services firms and the amount of damages claimed have been increasing. Among other things, these risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for Company products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of the Company’s controls. Claims against the Company may increase due to a variety of factors, such as if clients suffer losses during a period of deteriorating equity market conditions, as the Company increases the level of advice it provides to clients, and as the Company enhances the services it provides to IAs. In addition, the Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, and SROs, and such regulation is becoming increasingly extensive and complex. The Company attempts to manage legal and compliance risk through policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid litigation claims and prevent or detect violations of applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, - 37 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, client privacy, employment policies, and contracts management. Despite the Company’s efforts to maintain an effective compliance program and internal controls, legal breaches and rule violations could result in reputational harm, significant losses and disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on the Company’s business activities. Credit Risk Credit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations. The Company’s direct exposure to credit risk mainly results from margin lending activities, securities lending activities, mortgage lending activities, its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and other investing activities. To manage the risks of such losses, the Company has established policies and procedures which include: establishing and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin requirements for certain securities. Collateral arrangements relating to margin loans, securities lending agreements, and resale agreements include provisions that require additional collateral in the event that market fluctuations result in declines in the value of collateral received. Additionally, for margin loan and securities lending agreements, collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral exceeds the amounts loaned. The Company’s credit risk exposure related to loans to banking clients is actively managed through individual and portfolio reviews performed by management. Management regularly reviews asset quality including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for loan losses, which is reviewed quarterly by management. The Company’s mortgage loan portfolios primarily include First Mortgages of $6.5 billion and HELOCs of $3.3 billion at December 31, 2012. The Company’s First Mortgage portfolio underwriting requirements are generally consistent with the underwriting requirements in the secondary market for loan portfolios. The Company’s underwriting guidelines include maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan is conforming or jumbo). These credit underwriting standards have limited the exposure to the types of loans that experienced high foreclosures and loss rates elsewhere in the industry in recent years. There have been no significant changes to the LTV ratio or FICO credit score underwriting guidelines related to the Company’s First Mortgage or HELOC portfolios during 2012. The Company does not offer loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO credit score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. At December 31, 2012, approximately 1% of both the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios consisted of loans to borrowers with updated FICO credit scores of less than 620. At December 31, 2012, the weighted-average originated LTV ratios were 60% and 59% for the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, respectively. The computation of the origination LTV ratio for a HELOC includes any first lien mortgage outstanding on the same property at the time of origination. At December 31, 2012, 22% of HELOCs ($725 million of the HELOC portfolio) were in a first lien position. The weighted-average originated FICO credit score was 768 for both the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios. The Company monitors the estimated current LTV ratios of its First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios on an ongoing basis. At December 31, 2012, the weighted-average estimated current LTV ratios were 62% and 72% for the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, respectively. The computation of the estimated current LTV ratio for a HELOC includes any first lien mortgage outstanding on the same property at the time of the HELOC’s origination. The Company estimates the current LTV ratio for each loan by reference to a home price appreciation index. The Company also monitors updated borrower FICO scores, delinquency trends, and verified liquid assets held by individual borrowers. At December 31, 2012, the weighted-average updated FICO scores were 768 and 767 for the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, respectively. A portion of the Company’s HELOC portfolio is secured by second liens on the associated properties. Second lien mortgage loans possess a higher degree of credit risk given the subordination to the first lien holder in the event of default. At - 38 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) December 31, 2012, $2.6 billion, or 78%, of the HELOC portfolio was in a second lien position. In addition to the credit monitoring activities described above, the Company also monitors credit risk on second lien HELOC loans by reviewing the delinquency status of the first lien loan on the associated property, when such status is available. The portion of the Company’s second lien HELOC portfolio for which the Company either holds the first lien or has the ability to monitor the delinquency status of the related first mortgage was $477 million, or 15%, of the HELOC portfolio at December 31, 2012. Additionally, at December 31, 2012, approximately 35% of the HELOC borrowers that had a balance only paid the minimum amount due. For more information on the Company’s credit quality indicators relating to its First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, including delinquency characteristics, borrower FICO scores at origination, updated borrower FICO scores, LTV ratios at origination, and estimated current LTV ratios, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 7. Loans to Banking Clients and Related Allowance for Loan Losses.” The following table presents certain of the Company’s loan quality metrics as a percentage of total outstanding loans: December 31, 2012 2011 Loan delinquencies (1) 0.77 % 0.81 % Nonaccrual loans 0.45 % 0.53 % Allowance for loan losses 0.52 % 0.55 % (1) Loan delinquencies are defined as loans that are 30 days or more past due. The Company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale and securities held to maturity portfolios, whose fair values totaled $46.1 billion and $18.7 billion at December 31, 2012, respectively. These portfolios include U.S. agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency notes, commercial paper, and other securities. U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings, however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. Included in non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities are securities collateralized by loans that are considered to be “Prime” (defined by the Company as loans to borrowers with a FICO credit score of 620 or higher at origination), and “Alt-A” (defined by the Company as Prime loans with reduced documentation at origination). Residential mortgage-backed securities, particularly Alt-A securities, experienced continued credit deterioration in 2012, including increased payment delinquency rates and losses on foreclosures of underlying mortgages. For a discussion of the impact of current market conditions on residential mortgage-backed securities, see “Current Market and Regulatory Environment and Other Developments.” At December 31, 2012, the amortized cost of non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities represented 2% of the total mortgage-backed securities portfolio. These securities were originated between 2003 and 2007. At December 31, 2012, all of the corporate debt securities and non-mortgage asset-backed securities were rated investment grade (defined as a rating equivalent to a Moody’s rating of “Baa” or higher, or a Standard & Poor’s rating of “BBB-” or higher). Schwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab’s client or a counterparty fails to meet its obligations to Schwab. The Company sponsors a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds. Although the Company has no obligation to do so, the Company may decide for competitive reasons to provide credit, liquidity or other support to its funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity. Such support could cause the Company to take significant charges and could reduce the Company’s liquidity. If the Company chose not to provide credit, liquidity or other support in such a situation, the Company could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected. - 39 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Concentration Risk The Company has exposure to concentration risk when holding large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry. The fair value of the Company’s investments in mortgage-backed securities totaled $39.5 billion at December 31, 2012. Of these, $38.8 billion were issued by U.S. agencies and $733 million were issued by private entities (non-agency securities). The U.S. agency securities are included in securities available for sale and securities held to maturity and the non-agency securities are included in securities available for sale. Included in non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities are securities collateralized by Alt-A loans. At December 31, 2012, the amortized cost and fair value of Alt-A mortgage-backed securities were $308 million and $269 million, respectively. The Company’s investments in corporate debt securities and commercial paper totaled $8.0 billion at December 31, 2012, with the majority issued by institutions in the financial services industry. These securities are included in securities available for sale, securities held to maturity, cash and cash equivalents, and other securities owned in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s loans to banking clients include $6.0 billion of adjustable rate first lien residential real estate mortgage loans at December 31, 2012. The Company’s adjustable rate mortgages have initial fixed interest rates for three to ten years and interest rates that adjust annually thereafter. Approximately 50% of these mortgages consisted of loans with interest-only payment terms. The interest rates on approximately 65% of these interest-only loans are not scheduled to reset for three or more years. The Company’s mortgage loans do not include interest terms described as temporary introductory rates below current market rates. At December 31, 2012, 45% of the residential real estate mortgages and 50% of the HELOC balances were secured by properties which are located in California. The Company’s HELOC product has a 30-year loan term with an initial draw period of 10 years from the date of origination. After the initial draw period, the balance outstanding at such time is converted to a 20-year amortizing loan. The interest rate during the initial draw period and the 20-year amortizing period is a floating rate based on the prime rate plus a margin. The following table presents when current outstanding HELOCs will convert to amortizing loans: December 31, 2012 Balance Within 1 year $ 152 > 1 year – 3 years 598 > 3 years – 5 years 436 > 5 years 2,101 Total $ 3,287 As of December 31, 2012, all of the Company’s HELOC loans are within the 10-year initial draw period, and as such, none of the HELOCs have converted to an amortizing loan. The Company also has exposure to concentration risk from its margin and securities lending activities collateralized by securities of a single issuer or industry. This concentration risk is mitigated by collateral arrangements that require the fair value of such collateral exceeds the amounts loaned. The Company has indirect exposure to U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral to secure its resale agreements. The Company’s primary credit exposure on these resale transactions is with its counterparty. The Company would have exposure to the U.S. Government and agency securities only in the event of the counterparty’s default on the resale agreements. The fair value of U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral for resale agreements totaled $19.7 billion at December 31, 2012. - 40 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) European Holdings The Company has exposure to non-sovereign financial and non-financial institutions in Europe. The following table shows the balances of this exposure by each country in Europe in which the issuer or counterparty is domiciled. The Company has no direct exposure to sovereign governments in Europe. The Company does not have unfunded commitments to counterparties in Europe, nor does it have exposure as a result of credit default protection purchased or sold separately as of December 31, 2012. The determination of the domicile of exposure varies by the type of investment. For time deposits and certificates of deposit, the exposure is grouped in the country in which the financial institution is chartered under the regulatory framework of the European country. For asset-backed commercial paper, the exposure is grouped by the country of the sponsoring bank that provides the credit and liquidity support for such instruments. For corporate debt securities, the exposure is grouped by the country in which the issuer is domiciled. In situations in which the Company invests in a corporate debt security of a U.S. subsidiary of a European parent company, such holdings will be attributable to the European country only if significant reliance is placed on the European parent company for credit support underlying the security. For substantially all of the holdings listed below, the issuers or counterparties were financial institutions. All of the Company’s resale agreements, which are included in investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes, are collateralized by U.S. government securities. Additionally, the Company’s securities lending activities are collateralized by cash. Therefore, the Company’s resale agreements and securities lending activities are not included in the table below even if the counterparty is a European institution.

At December 31, 2012, the Company had $329 million in investments in these Funds. Certain of the Funds’ positions include certificates of deposits, time deposits, commercial paper and corporate debt securities issued by counterparties in Europe. Management mitigates exposure to European holdings by employing a separate team of credit analysts that evaluate each issuer, counterparty, and country. Management monitors its exposure to European issuers by 1) performing risk assessments of the foreign countries, which include evaluating the size of the country and economy, currency trends, political landscape and the countries’ regulatory environment and developments, 2) performing ad hoc stress tests that evaluate the impact of sovereign governments’ debt write-downs on the issuers and counterparties to our investments, 3) reviewing publicly available stress tests that are published by various regulators in the European market, 4) establishing credit and maturity limits by issuer, and 5) monitoring aggregate exposures by country. Market Risk Market risk is the potential for changes in revenue or the value of financial instruments held by the Company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices or market conditions. For discussion of the Company’s market risk, see “Item 7A – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company uses fair value measurements to record certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value, and to determine fair value disclosures. Assets are measured at fair value using quoted prices or market-based information and accordingly are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 measurements in accordance with the fair value hierarchy described in fair value measurement accounting guidance. Liabilities recorded at fair value were not material at December 31, 2012 or 2011. See “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and 17. Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities” for more information on the Company’s assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. When available, the Company uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. When utilizing market data with a bid-ask spread, the Company uses the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices do not exist, the Company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets. The Company generally obtains prices from at least three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value and may obtain up to five prices on assets with higher risk of limited observable information, such as non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. The Company’s primary independent pricing service provides prices based on observable trades and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar “to-be-issued” securities. The Company compares the prices obtained from its primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. The Company does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in a material difference in the recorded amounts. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company did not adjust prices received from the primary independent third-party pricing service. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. While the majority of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position and - 42 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) reported financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy. Other-than-Temporary Impairment of Securities Available for Sale and Securities Held to Maturity Management evaluates whether securities available for sale and securities held to maturity are other-than-temporarily impaired (OTTI) on a quarterly basis. Debt securities with unrealized losses are considered OTTI if the Company intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such security prior to any anticipated recovery. If management determines that a security is OTTI under these circumstances, the impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the entire difference between the amortized cost and the then-current fair value. A security is also OTTI if management does not expect to recover the amortized cost of the security. In this circumstance, management utilizes cash flow models to estimate the expected future cash flow from the securities and to estimate the credit loss. The impairment recognized in earnings is measured by the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost of the security. Expected cash flows are discounted using the security’s effective interest rate. The evaluation of whether the Company expects to recover the amortized cost of a security is inherently judgmental. The evaluation includes the assessment of several bond performance indicators including: the portion of the underlying loans that are delinquent (30 days, 60 days, 90+ days), in bankruptcy, in foreclosure or converted to real estate owned; the actual amount of loss incurred on the underlying loans in which the property has been foreclosed and sold; the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security available to absorb credit losses on the underlying loans; the current price and magnitude of the unrealized loss; and whether the Company has received all scheduled principal and interest payments. Management uses cash flow models to further assess the likelihood of other-than-temporary impairment for the Company’s non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. To develop the cash flow models, the Company uses forecasted loss severity, prepayment speeds (i.e. the rate at which the principal on underlying loans are paid down), and default rates over the securities’ expected remaining maturities. Valuation of Goodwill The Company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually, or whenever indications of impairment exist. Impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, resulting in an impairment charge for this excess. Adverse changes in the Company’s planned business operations such as unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit, or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the Company’s recorded goodwill. The Company’s annual goodwill impairment testing date is April 1st. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on April 1, 2012, the fair values of the Company’s reporting units (generally defined as the Company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) substantially exceeded their carrying values, and therefore management concluded that no amount of goodwill was impaired. The estimated fair values of the reporting units were established using a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit and a market capitalization analysis. As allowed by applicable accounting standards, the Company can elect to qualitatively assess goodwill for impairment if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. Allowance for Loan Losses The appropriateness of the allowance is reviewed quarterly by management, taking into consideration current economic conditions, the existing loan portfolio composition, past loss experience, and risks inherent in the portfolio. The methodology to establish an allowance for loan losses utilizes statistical models that estimate prepayments, defaults, and probable losses for the loan segments based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the segments. The methodology considers the effects of borrower behavior and a variety of factors including, but not limited to, interest rates, housing price - 43 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) movements as measured by a housing price index, economic conditions, estimated defaults and foreclosures measured by historical and expected delinquencies, changes in prepayment speeds, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, past loss experience, estimates of future loss severities, borrower credit risk measured by FICO scores, and the adequacy of collateral. The methodology also evaluates concentrations in the loan segments including loan products, year of origination, geographical distribution of collateral, and the portion of borrowers who have other client relationships with the Company. Probable losses are forecast using a loan-level simulation of the delinquency status of the loans over the term of the loans. The simulation starts with the current relevant risk indicators, including the current delinquent status of each loan, the estimated current LTV ratio of each loan, the term and structure of each loan, current key interest rates including U.S. Treasury and London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rates, and borrower FICO scores. The more significant variables in the simulation include delinquency roll rates, loss severity, housing prices, and interest rates. Delinquency roll rates (i.e., the rates at which loans transition through delinquency stages and ultimately result in a loss) are estimated from the Company’s historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information. Further, the delinquency roll rates within the loan-level simulation discussed above are calibrated to match a moving average of the delinquency roll rates actually experienced in the respective First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios. Loss severity estimates are based on the Company’s historical loss experience and market trends. The estimated loss severity (i.e. loss given default) used in the allowance for loan loss methodology for HELOCs is higher than that used in the methodology for First Mortgages. Housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values. Factors affecting the home price index include: housing inventory, unemployment, interest rates, and inflation expectations. Interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths. As a result, the current state of house prices, including the decrease in general house prices experienced over the last several years, as well as the current state of delinquencies unique to the Company’s First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, are considered in the allowance for loan loss methodology. This methodology results in loss factors that are applied to the outstanding balances to determine the allowance for loan loss for each loan segment. Legal and Regulatory Reserves Reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, insurance coverage and indemnification, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved. The Company’s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee. Additionally, management has reviewed with the Audit Committee the Company’s significant estimates discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential for changes in revenue or the value of financial instruments held by the Company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices or market conditions. For the Company’s market risk related to interest rates, a sensitivity analysis, referred to as a net interest revenue simulation model, is shown below. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on its interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources that finance these assets. Net interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may re-price at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short and long-term interest rates. Interest-earning assets include residential real estate loans and mortgage-backed securities. These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and to changes to prepayment levels, which tend to increase in a declining rate environment. To mitigate the risk of loss, the Company has established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk, and monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interest-earning assets and funding sources. To remain within these guidelines, the Company manages the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios. Because the Company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients, the rates charged on margin loans, and controls the composition of its investment securities, it has some ability to manage its net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions. The Company is also subject to market risk as a result of fluctuations in equity prices. The Company’s direct holdings of equity securities and its associated exposure to equity prices are not material. The Company is indirectly exposed to equity market fluctuations in connection with securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers, and customer securities loaned out as part of the Company’s securities lending activities. Equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity, margin borrowing, and overall client engagement with the Company. Additionally, the Company earns mutual fund service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets. Fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue earned by the Company. Financial instruments held by the Company are also subject to liquidity risk – that is, the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument. Recent conditions in the credit markets have significantly reduced market liquidity in a wide range of financial instruments, including the types of instruments held by the Company, and fair value can differ significantly from the value implied by the credit quality and actual performance of the instrument’s underlying cash flows. Financial instruments held by the Company are also subject to valuation risk as a result of changes in valuations of the underlying collateral, such as housing prices in the case of residential real estate loans and mortgage-backed securities. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and securities available for sale, see “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Current Market and Regulatory Environment and Other Developments.” The Company’s market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material. Net Interest Revenue Simulation The Company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulation model (the model) includes all interest-sensitive assets and liabilities. Key variables in the model include the repricing of financial instruments, prepayment, reinvestment, and product pricing assumptions. The Company uses constant balances and market rates in the model assumptions in order to minimize the number of variables and to better isolate risks. The simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue. Actual results may differ from simulated - 47 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION results due to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies, including changes in asset and liability mix. As represented by the simulations presented below, the Company’s investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall (i.e., interest-earning assets generally reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities). The simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As the Company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood the Company would take steps to manage any additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment. The following table shows the results of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to the Company’s current market rates forecast on simulated net interest revenue over the next 12 months beginning December 31, 2012 and 2011. December 31, 2012 2011 Increase of 100 basis points 19.2 % 19.1 % Decrease of 100 basis points (10.0 %) (8.1 %) The sensitivities shown in the simulation reflect the fact that short-term interest rates in 2012 remained at historically low levels, including the federal funds target rate, which was unchanged at a range of zero to 0.25%. The current low interest rate environment limits the extent to which the Company can reduce interest expense paid on funding sources in a declining interest rate scenario. A decline in interest rates could therefore negatively impact the yield on the Company’s investment portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense, further compressing net interest margin. Any increases in short-term interest rates result in a greater impact as yields on interest-earning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources. - 48 - Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION",2023-12-30 18:56:39.698985
